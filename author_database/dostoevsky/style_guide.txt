=========================================
CHARACTERISTIC DOSTOEVSKY MOMENTS
=========================================

**Raskolnikov Cannot Look His Mother in the Eye**:
After murder, moral-psychological collapse instant. Cannot face loved ones. Crime severs him from humanity.

**Sonya Reads Lazarus to Raskolnikov**:
"He that was dead came forth." Resurrection of soul possible through suffering love, not philosophy.

**Underground Man's Opening**:
"I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man." Consciousness itself becomes torture. Too much thought, not enough life.

**Raskolnikov's Confession**:
Not to authorities first, but to Sonya. Must acknowledge crime to another soul before can return to humanity.

**Siberian Epilogue**:
Raskolnikov saved not by philosophy but by suffering in love. Grace comes through Sonya.

**The Grand Inquisitor** (Brothers Karamazov):
Christ returns, kisses the Inquisitor. Freedom and love trump authority and bread.
