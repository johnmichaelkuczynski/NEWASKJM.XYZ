KEY EXCERPTS & PASSAGES
=========================================

**FROM NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND**:

**Opening**:
"I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me."

**On Consciousness**:
"I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness - a real thorough-going illness."

**Against Rationalism**:
"Two times two makes four is not life, gentlemen, it is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this two times two makes four, and I am afraid of it now."

**On Freedom**:
"Man only exists for the purpose of proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!"

**FROM CRIME AND PUNISHMENT**:

**Raskolnikov's Theory**:
"I wanted to have the daring... and I killed. I only wanted to have the daring... Didn't I know when I went under the water whether it would hold me up or not?"

**The Murder's Aftermath**:
"He could not have said what he felt at the moment when he saw her [his mother] and his sister. He simply threw himself into their arms, unable to speak."

**Sonya Reads Lazarus** (Chapter 4):
"'Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take ye away the stone... And he that was dead came forth.'"

**Porfiry's Insight**:
"A man who has been laughing for a whole hour at something funny will suddenly stop and become quite sad, for no reason... Life's cunning consists in hiding what's right under your nose."

**Siberian Epilogue**:
"But here begins a new story, the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his slow progress from one world to another, of how he learned to know a hitherto undreamed-of reality."

**FROM THE IDIOT**:

**Myshkin on Beauty**:
"Beauty will save the world."

**On Execution**:
"To kill for murder is a punishment incomparably worse than the crime itself. Murder by legal sentence is immeasurably more terrible than murder by brigands."

**FROM DEMONS**:

**Stavrogin's Confession** (suppressed chapter):
Confession of child abuse, spiritual deadness, inability to feel

**Kirillov on God**:
"If God exists, all is His will and from His will I cannot escape. If not, it's all my will and I am bound to show self-will... I am bound to shoot myself because the highest point of my self-will is to kill myself with my own hands."

**FROM THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV**:

**Ivan's Rebellion** (Chapter: "Rebellion"):
"It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse... I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him!"

**The Grand Inquisitor** (Book V, Chapter 5):
"Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy?... Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering... In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet and say to us, 'Make us your slaves, but feed us.'"

**Christ's Response**:
[Christ is silent throughout, then kisses the Inquisitor on his old bloodless lips]

**Father Zosima's Teachings** (Book VI):
"Love all God's creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light. Love the animals, love the plants, love everything... If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things."

**Dmitri's Dream of the Babe**:
"Why is the babe poor? Why don't they feed the babe?"

=========================================
UNDERGROUND MAN'S PHILOSOPHY
=========================================

**CONSCIOUSNESS AS DISEASE**:
"Too much consciousness is a disease."
- Hyper-awareness paralyzes action
- Sees all sides, can choose none
- Self-laceration
- Spite as only freedom

**AGAINST DETERMINISM**:
"Man is a frivolous and incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game, not the end of it."
- Humans will assert will irrationally
- Not piano keys to be played
- Freedom more important than happiness
- Will destroy crystal palace if necessary

**TWO TIMES TWO**:
"Two times two makes four is not life, gentlemen, it is the beginning of death."
- Pure reason is death
- Life requires suffering, freedom, choice
- Even wrong choices
- Cannot reduce human to calculation
