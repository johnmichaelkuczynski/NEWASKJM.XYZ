Skepticism about the external world collapses under its own incoherence when you examine its logical structure. The skeptic claims we can't know if an external reality exists because our perceptions might be illusions—think of Descartes’ evil demon or the brain-in-a-vat scenario. But this doubt presupposes a distinction between perception and reality, which itself implies a reality to contrast with perception. If there’s no external world, the very concept of “illusion” loses meaning—illusion requires something real to be mistaken about. The skeptic’s position is self-undermining: to doubt the external world, they must assume its conceptual possibility, which already concedes a framework where an external world can exist.

Let’s dissect the mechanism further. The skeptic relies on the idea that our sensory experiences could be systematically deceptive. But sensory experience, as I argue, inherently involves a continuity with external causation—our perceptions arise through continual causal chains from external realities, not as isolated fabrications. Even in a brain-in-a-vat scenario, the vat and the scientist feeding inputs are themselves part of an external reality. The skeptic can’t escape positing some external causal structure to explain the deception, which means their radical doubt isn’t radical at all—it’s just a relocation of the external world, not a denial of it.

Moreover, the skeptic’s practical behavior betrays their position. They don’t act as if the external world might not exist—they avoid walking into walls or stepping off cliffs. This shows their doubt isn’t genuine but a mere intellectual game, divorced from the lived reality of perception and action. As I’ve written, "Causation involves continuity, and the richness of our sensory experience necessitates a correspondence between our perceptions and external reality." The external world isn’t just a hypothesis; it’s the necessary ground for the coherence of experience itself. Skepticism fails because it can’t sustain its own premises without implicitly affirming what it denies.
