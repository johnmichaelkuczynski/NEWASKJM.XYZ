--- KEY QUOTATIONS ---
1. This then is one principle (though not one or existent in the same sense as the 'this'), and the definition was one as we agreed; then further there is its contrary, the privation.
2. In what sense these are two, and in what sense more, has been stated above.
3. Briefly, we explained first that only the contraries were principles, and later that a substratum was indispensable, and that the principles were three; our last statement has elucidated the difference between the contraries, the mutual relation of the principles, and the nature of the substratum.
4. Whether the form or the substratum is the essential nature of a physical object is not yet clear.
5. But that the principles are three, and in what sense, and the way in which each is a principle, is clear.
6. So much then for the question of the number and the nature of the principles.
7. We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own, is solved in this way alone.
8. The first of those who studied science were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were thrust them into another path.
9. So they say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible.
10. Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something comes to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or what is does something or has something done to it or becomes some particular thing', are to be taken(in the first way of putting our explanation) in the same sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him', 'is or becomes something from being a doctor.'
11. matter is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation in no sense is.
12. They, on the other hand, identify their Great and Small alike with not being, and that whether they are taken together as one or separately.
13. Their triad is therefore of quite a different kind from ours.
14. For they got so far as to see that there must be some underlying nature, but they make it one-for even if one philosopher makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great and Small, the effect is the same, for he overlooked the other nature.
15. For the one which persists is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes to be-a mother, as it were.
16. But the negative part of the contrariety may often seem, if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not to exist at all.
17. For admitting with them that there is something divine, good, and desirable, we hold that there are two other principles, the one contrary to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for it.
18. The truth is that what desires the form is matter, as the female desires the male and the ugly the beautiful-only the ugly or the female not per se but per accidens.
19. The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in another it does not.
20. As that which contains the privation, it ceases to be in its own nature, for what ceases to be-the privation-is contained within it.

The text presents a comprehensive metaphysical argument centered on the concept of three principles of existence-form, privation, and substratum-and the distinction between potentiality and actuality. It aims to resolve the difficulties faced by early thinkers regarding the nature of being and becoming. The argument is structured to first establish the three principles, then to clarify their roles and interrelations, and finally to demonstrate how these principles, along with the potentiality-actuality distinction, provide a coherent account of change and existence, addressing the metaphysical challenges posed by early philosophers.

The text presents a comprehensive analysis of Aristotle's metaphysical framework, focusing on the concepts of matter, privation, and form. It begins by distinguishing matter as nearly substance and privation as non-substance, critiques other philosophical triads, and develops the idea of matter's desire for form through analogies. The text also explores the dual nature of matter and its application to natural objects, concluding with an affirmation of the principles and setting the stage for further inquiry into perishable objects.

2. **Scholarly Community**: The text engages with the community of philosophers and scholars who study ancient Greek philosophy, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. It contributes to ongoing discussions about the nature of reality and change.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement
1. **Primary Formulation**: The core thesis of the text is that the nature of becoming and change can be understood through the concept of a substratum, which persists through changes and is the underlying principle of natural objects.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also posits that the principles of natural objects, including matter and form, are essential for understanding the process of becoming and the nature of substances.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument 1: Persistence of Substratum**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that there must be something that persists through changes, which it calls the substratum. This substratum is the underlying reality that remains constant despite the changes in form or properties.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses examples such as the growth of animals and plants from seeds to illustrate how something persists through the process of becoming.

2. **Argument 2: Principles of Natural Objects**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that natural objects are composed of matter and form, and these principles are essential for understanding the nature of becoming. Matter provides the potential for change, while form actualizes that potential.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text discusses the bronze and the statue, the wood and the bed, to illustrate how matter and form work together in the process of becoming.

3. **Argument 3: Distinction Between Qualified and Unqualified Becoming**
   - **Explanation**: The text distinguishes between qualified and unqualified becoming, arguing that only substances 'come to be' in the unqualified sense. This distinction helps clarify the nature of change and the role of the substratum.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses examples of different types of change, such as the change in color or shape, to illustrate the difference between qualified and unqualified becoming.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Number of Principles**
   - **Explanation**: The text discusses the number of principles involved in becoming, considering whether there are two or three principles. It argues that the apparent contradiction can be resolved by understanding the different ways in which principles can be counted.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text engages in dialectical moves to address different perspectives on the number of principles, showing how the main thesis can accommodate these views.

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Role of Opposites**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that opposites play a crucial role in the process of becoming, as change often involves a transition from one state to its opposite.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses examples of changes in properties, such as hot to cold or wet to dry, to illustrate the role of opposites in becoming.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments
1. **Realism**: The text assumes a realist epistemology, where the underlying substratum and the principles of natural objects are considered to have an objective existence.
2. **Empirical Knowledge**: The text also assumes that empirical knowledge plays a role in understanding the nature of becoming, as evidenced by the use of examples from the natural world to support its arguments.
3. **Hylomorphic Framework**: The text assumes a hylomorphic framework, where substances are understood as composites of matter and form, which is essential for its arguments about becoming.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument
1. **Premises**: The text begins with premises about the nature of change and the need for something to persist through changes. It also establishes premises about the principles of natural objects, including matter and form.
2. **Inference**: From these premises, the text infers the necessity of a substratum and the role of matter and form in the process of becoming.
3. **Conclusion**: The text concludes that the nature of becoming can be understood through the concept of a substratum and the principles of natural objects, which provide a coherent explanation for the persistence of something through changes.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also posits that the principles of natural objects can be considered as two (subject and form) or three (subject, form, and privation), depending on the perspective.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument for the Existence of a Substratum**: The text argues that for change to occur, there must be something that persists through the change. This is supported by examples such as a man becoming musical, where 'man' is the substratum that persists.
   - **Explanation**: The text uses the example of a man becoming musical to illustrate that while the attribute 'musical' comes into existence, the underlying 'man' remains the same. This supports the idea that there must be a substratum that persists through changes.
2. **Argument for the Distinction Between Subject and Opposite**: The text argues that the subject (e.g., 'man') survives the change, while the opposite (e.g., 'unmusical') does not. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of becoming.
   - **Explanation**: By distinguishing between the subject and the opposite, the text clarifies that the subject is the persistent element in change, while the opposite is the attribute that does not survive. This supports the idea of a substratum.
3. **Argument for the Complexity of Becoming**: The text argues that becoming involves both something that comes into existence and something that becomes that, highlighting the complexity of the process.
   - **Explanation**: The text explains that becoming is not a simple process but involves multiple elements, including the substratum and the new attribute. This complexity supports the need for a substratum to explain the process.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Argument for the Scientific Nature of Substratum Knowledge**: The text claims that the underlying nature of substances can be an object of scientific knowledge, suggesting a relationship between metaphysical claims and empirical evidence.
   - **Explanation**: By linking the substratum to scientific knowledge, the text implies that the concept of a substratum is not merely philosophical but can be empirically investigated.
2. **Argument for the Theoretical Innovation on the Number of Principles**: The text argues that the principles of natural objects can be considered as two or three, depending on the perspective, which is a theoretical innovation.
   - **Explanation**: This argument suggests that the number of principles can vary based on how one views the process of becoming, adding a layer of complexity to the understanding of natural objects.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement
1. **Primary Formulation:**
   - Matter is nearly, in a sense, substance, while privation is not substance at all. Aristotle's triad of principles (matter, form, and privation) differs fundamentally from the Pythagorean and Platonic triad (Great, Small, and One).

2. **Secondary Formulation:**
   - There are two other principles besides the divine, good, and desirable: one contrary to it and another that desires and yearns for it. Matter is the principle that desires form, akin to the female desiring the male.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Matter as Substance:**
   - Matter is described as the primary substratum of each thing, persisting in the result of change. It is a joint cause with form in the generation of substances, likened to a mother.
     - **Explanation:** Aristotle argues that matter is essential for the existence of substances because it provides the underlying potentiality for change and persistence. Without matter, there could be no transformation or continuity in the natural world.

2. **Privation as Non-Substance:**
   - Privation is not a substance but a lack or absence within matter. It ceases to be in its own nature when considered as an evil agent.
     - **Explanation:** Aristotle distinguishes privation from substance by emphasizing that it is not a positive entity but a negation or absence. This absence is contained within matter and does not persist independently.

3. **Contrast with Pythagorean and Platonic Triads:**
   - The Pythagorean and Platonic triads (Great, Small, and One) are fundamentally different from Aristotle's triad (matter, form, privation) because they identify the Great and Small with non-being.
     - **Explanation:** Aristotle critiques the Pythagorean and Platonic views for failing to recognize the distinct nature of matter and form. He argues that their triad lacks the necessary differentiation between positive and negative principles.

4. **Desire and Yearning for Form:**
   - Matter desires form, analogous to the female desiring the male or the ugly desiring the beautiful. This desire is not per se but per accidens.
     - **Explanation:** Aristotle uses the analogy of desire to explain the relationship between matter and form. Matter, as potentiality, seeks to actualize itself through form, which is the principle of actuality.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Nature as a Principle of Motion and Rest:**
   - Natural objects have an innate principle of motion and rest, distinguishing them from artificial objects.
     - **Explanation:** This argument supports the broader thesis by establishing the foundational role of nature in the physical world, which is composed of matter and form.

2. **Matter's Dual Nature:**
   - Matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense but does not in another. As potentiality, it is outside the sphere of becoming and ceasing to be.
     - **Explanation:** This claim elaborates on the nature of matter, highlighting its dual role as both a substratum for change and a persistent potentiality.

3. **Form as the Primary Principle of Science:**
   - The accurate determination of the first principle in respect of form is the province of the primary type of science.
     - **Explanation:** This argument underscores the importance of form in Aristotle's metaphysical framework, positioning it as a central concern of philosophical inquiry.
