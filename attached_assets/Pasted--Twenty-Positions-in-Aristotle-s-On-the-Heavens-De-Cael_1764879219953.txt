**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *On the Heavens* (De Caelo)**

1. The **cosmos is a finite, spherical, and eternal whole**—it has no beginning and no end in time.

2. There are **two distinct regions of the cosmos**: the superlunary (heavens) and the sublunary (terrestrial).

3. The heavenly bodies are composed of a **fifth element (aether)**—distinct from earth, water, air, and fire, and not subject to generation or corruption.

4. Aether's natural motion is **eternal circular locomotion**—unlike the rectilinear motion natural to the four terrestrial elements.

5. **Circular motion is prior to and more perfect than rectilinear motion**—it alone can be continuous, uniform, and eternal.

6. The **heavens are eternal and unchangeable**—the celestial realm admits no generation, corruption, growth, or alteration.

7. The **stars and planets are divine beings**—their eternal circular motion reflects their perfection and divinity.

8. The celestial spheres are **animate and ensouled**—their motion is voluntary activity, not mechanical compulsion.

9. The **earth is spherical**—demonstrated by the shape of its shadow on the moon during eclipses and by the changing visibility of stars as one travels north or south.

10. The **earth is at rest at the center of the cosmos**—it does not rotate or revolve; the heavens revolve around it.

11. Earth rests at the center **by nature, not by constraint**—heavy elements naturally move toward the center; earth has nowhere further to fall.

12. The **cosmos is unique**—there cannot be multiple worlds, because all matter of each element would naturally collect in a single cosmic center.

13. There is **nothing outside the cosmos**—no void, no body, no place, no time beyond the outermost sphere.

14. The four **terrestrial elements** have natural rectilinear motions: earth and water move downward (toward center), fire and air move upward (toward periphery).

15. **Heaviness and lightness are natural tendencies**, not relational properties—earth is absolutely heavy, fire absolutely light.

16. Each element has a **natural place** to which it moves and in which it rests unless impeded.

17. The elements can **transform into one another** through qualitative change—unlike aether, which is immutable.

18. The **size of the earth is relatively small** compared to the celestial spheres—Aristotle cites mathematicians' estimates of its circumference.

19. Against the atomists: **indivisible magnitudes and infinite void are impossible**—the cosmos is continuous and plenum.

20. The **order and regularity of celestial motion** evidences cosmic rationality—the heavens manifest an intelligible, purposive structure that physics must explain through final as well as efficient causes.
