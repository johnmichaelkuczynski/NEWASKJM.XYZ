## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Epistemology can be naturalized by studying actual cases of knowledge acquisition, particularly through the development of AI that can solve unbounded sets of problem-sets that humans can solve.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The development of AI is a successful naturalization of epistemology, and its continued development will deepen our understanding of the nature of knowledge.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Distinction Between Belief-Formation and Knowledge-Constitutive Beliefs**:
   - The text argues that while empirical research on belief-formation cannot directly yield epistemic norms, focusing on cases where beliefs constitute knowledge reveals processes that comply with these norms.
   - This distinction is crucial because it allows for the identification of processes that lead to knowledge, which is essential for naturalizing epistemology.

2. **Indirect Knowledge of Thought-Processes**:
   - The text acknowledges that we cannot directly know others' thought-processes but suggests that if we could, we would find them sensitive to epistemic norms.
   - This argument supports the thesis by implying that the study of knowledge acquisition, even indirectly, can reveal the norms governing knowledge.

3. **AI as a Model for Human Knowledge Acquisition**:
   - The text posits that AI systems, which we construct and understand, can serve as models for human knowledge acquisition.
   - By building AI that solves problems in ways similar to humans, we can infer the methods humans use to acquire knowledge, thus naturalizing epistemology.

4. **Scalability of Problem-Solving Strategies**:
   - The text argues that if an AI system can solve an unbounded range of problems, it is likely using methods similar to those used by humans.
   - This argument supports the thesis by suggesting that AI's problem-solving strategies can be generalized to human knowledge acquisition.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Critique of Conventional Epistemology**:
   - The text critiques the conventional view that epistemology cannot be naturalized, arguing that this view is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between empirical research and epistemic norms.

2. **The Brain as a 'Black Box'**:
   - The text claims that the brain's complexity and the difficulty in studying its processes do not preclude the possibility of naturalizing epistemology through AI.

3. **Vagueness and Falsifiability of Hypotheses**:
   - The text suggests that hypotheses about how the mind solves problems are often vague and hard to falsify, which supports the need for a more empirical approach through AI.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Functional Equivalence**: The text assumes that if an AI system can solve problems in a way functionally equivalent to humans, it is using similar methods.

2. **Transparency of AI Processes**: There is an assumption that the processes of AI systems are transparent to their creators, allowing for direct insight into their problem-solving methods.

3. **Generalizability of AI Insights**: The text assumes that insights gained from AI can be generalized to human knowledge acquisition, despite the differences between artificial and biological systems.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premises**:
   - Empirical research can reveal processes involved in knowledge acquisition.
   - AI systems can be constructed to solve problems in ways similar to humans.
   - If AI can solve an unbounded range of problems, it is likely using methods similar to humans.

2. **Conclusion**: Therefore, epistemology can be naturalized by studying AI systems that solve problems in ways similar to humans.

4. **Indirect Knowledge of Thought-Processes**: It discusses the limitations of directly knowing thought-processes but suggests that if we could, we would find them sensitive to epistemic norms.

5. **AI as a Model**: The text then introduces AI as a potential model for human knowledge acquisition, arguing that AI's problem-solving methods can be studied to understand human knowledge acquisition.

6. **Scalability and Generalizability**: It further develops the argument by discussing the scalability of problem-solving strategies and the likelihood that AI uses methods similar to humans when solving an unbounded range of problems.
