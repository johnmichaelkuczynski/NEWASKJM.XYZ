PREFACE


The writer of this book was temporarily attached to the British
Treasury during the war and was their official representative at the
Paris Peace Conference up to June 7, 1919; he also sat as deputy for
the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the Supreme Economic Council. He
resigned from these positions when it became evident that hope could
no longer be entertained of substantial modification in the draft
Terms of Peace. The grounds of his objection to the Treaty, or rather
to the whole policy of the Conference towards the economic problems of
Europe, will appear in the following chapters. They are entirely of a
public character, and are based on facts known to the whole world.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY


The power to become habituated to his surroundings is a marked
characteristic of mankind. Very few of us realize with conviction the
intensely unusual, unstable, complicated, unreliable, temporary nature
of the economic organization by which Western Europe has lived for the
last half century. We assume some of the most peculiar and temporary of
our late advantages as natural, permanent, and to be depended on, and we
lay our plans accordingly. On this sandy and false foundation we scheme
for social improvement and dress our political platforms, pursue our
animosities and particular ambitions, and feel ourselves with enough
margin in hand to foster, not assuage, civil conflict in the European
family. Moved by insane delusion and reckless self-regard, the German
people overturned the foundations on which we all lived and built. But
the spokesmen of the French and British peoples have run the risk of
completing the ruin, which Germany began, by a Peace which, if it is
carried into effect, must impair yet further, when it might have
restored, the delicate, complicated organization, already shaken and
broken by war, through which alone the European peoples can employ
themselves and live.

In England the outward aspect of life does not yet teach us to feel or
realize in the least that an age is over. We are busy picking up the
threads of our life where we dropped them, with this difference only,
that many of us seem a good deal richer than we were before. Where we
spent millions before the war, we have now learnt that we can spend
hundreds of millions and apparently not suffer for it. Evidently we did
not exploit to the utmost the possibilities of our economic life. We
look, therefore, not only to a return to the comforts of 1914, but to an
immense broadening and intensification of them. All classes alike thus
build their plans, the rich to spend more and save less, the poor to
spend more and work less.

But perhaps it is only in England (and America) that it is possible to
be so unconscious. In continental Europe the earth heaves and no one but
is aware of the rumblings. There it is not just a matter of extravagance
or "labor troubles"; but of life and death, of starvation and existence,
and of the fearful convulsions of a dying civilization.

       *       *       *       *       *

For one who spent in Paris the greater part of the six months which
succeeded the Armistice an occasional visit to London was a strange
experience. England still stands outside Europe. Europe's voiceless
tremors do not reach her. Europe is apart and England is not of her
flesh and body. But Europe is solid with herself. France, Germany,
Italy, Austria and Holland, Russia and Roumania and Poland, throb
together, and their structure and civilization are essentially one. They
flourished together, they have rocked together in a war, which we, in
spite of our enormous contributions and sacrifices (like though in a
less degree than America), economically stood outside, and they may fall
together. In this lies the destructive significance of the Peace of
Paris. If the European Civil War is to end with France and Italy abusing
their momentary victorious power to destroy Germany and Austria-Hungary
now prostrate, they invite their own destruction also, being so deeply
and inextricably intertwined with their victims by hidden psychic and
economic bonds. At any rate an Englishman who took part in the
Conference of Paris and was during those months a member of the Supreme
Economic Council of the Allied Powers, was bound to become, for him a
new experience, a European in his cares and outlook. There, at the nerve
center of the European system, his British preoccupations must largely
fall away and he must be haunted by other and more dreadful specters.
Paris was a nightmare, and every one there was morbid. A sense of
impending catastrophe overhung the frivolous scene; the futility and
smallness of man before the great events confronting him; the mingled
significance and unreality of the decisions; levity, blindness,
insolence, confused cries from without,--all the elements of ancient
tragedy were there. Seated indeed amid the theatrical trappings of the
French Saloons of State, one could wonder if the extraordinary visages
of Wilson and of Clemenceau, with their fixed hue and unchanging
characterization, were really faces at all and not the tragi-comic masks
of some strange drama or puppet-show.

The proceedings of Paris all had this air of extraordinary importance
and unimportance at the same time. The decisions seemed charged with
consequences to the future of human society; yet the air whispered that
the word was not flesh, that it was futile, insignificant, of no effect,
dissociated from events; and one felt most strongly the impression,
described by Tolstoy in _War and Peace_ or by Hardy in _The Dynasts_, of
events marching on to their fated conclusion uninfluenced and unaffected
by the cerebrations of Statesmen in Council:

        _Spirit of the Years_

    Observe that all wide sight and self-command
    Deserts these throngs now driven to demonry
    By the Immanent Unrecking. Nought remains
    But vindictiveness here amid the strong,
    And there amid the weak an impotent rage.

        _Spirit of the Pities_

    Why prompts the Will so senseless-shaped a doing?

        _Spirit of the Years_

    I have told thee that It works unwittingly,
    As one possessed not judging.

In Paris, where those connected with the Supreme Economic Council,
received almost hourly the reports of the misery, disorder, and decaying
organization of all Central and Eastern Europe, allied and enemy alike,
and learnt from the lips of the financial representatives of Germany and
Austria unanswerable evidence, of the terrible exhaustion of their
countries, an occasional visit to the hot, dry room in the President's
house, where the Four fulfilled their destinies in empty and arid
intrigue, only added to the sense of nightmare. Yet there in Paris the
problems of Europe were terrible and clamant, and an occasional return
to the vast unconcern of London a little disconcerting. For in London
these questions were very far away, and our own lesser problems alone
troubling. London believed that Paris was making a great confusion of
its business, but remained uninterested. In this spirit the British
people received the Treaty without reading it. But it is under the
influence of Paris, not London, that this book has been written by one
who, though an Englishman, feels himself a European also, and, because
of too vivid recent experience, cannot disinterest himself from the
further unfolding of the great historic drama of these days which will
destroy great institutions, but may also create a new world.




CHAPTER II

EUROPE BEFORE THE WAR


Before 1870 different parts of the small continent of Europe had
specialized in their own products; but, taken as a whole, it was
substantially self-subsistent. And its population was adjusted to this
state of affairs.

After 1870 there was developed on a large scale an unprecedented
situation, and the economic condition of Europe became during the next
fifty years unstable and peculiar. The pressure of population on food,
which had already been balanced by the accessibility of supplies from
America, became for the first time in recorded history definitely
reversed. As numbers increased, food was actually easier to secure.
Larger proportional returns from an increasing scale of production
became true of agriculture as well as industry. With the growth of the
European population there were more emigrants on the one hand to till
the soil of the new countries, and, on the other, more workmen were
available in Europe to prepare the industrial products and capital goods
which were to maintain the emigrant populations in their new homes, and
to build the railways and ships which were to make accessible to Europe
food and raw products from distant sources. Up to about 1900 a unit of
labor applied to industry yielded year by year a purchasing power over
an increasing quantity of food. It is possible that about the year 1900
this process began to be reversed, and a diminishing yield of Nature to
man's effort was beginning to reassert itself. But the tendency of
cereals to rise in real cost was balanced by other improvements;
and--one of many novelties--the resources of tropical Africa then for
the first time came into large employ, and a great traffic in oil-seeds
began to bring to the table of Europe in a new and cheaper form one of
the essential foodstuffs of mankind. In this economic Eldorado, in this
economic Utopia, as the earlier economists would have deemed it, most of
us were brought up.

That happy age lost sight of a view of the world which filled with
deep-seated melancholy the founders of our Political Economy. Before the
eighteenth century mankind entertained no false hopes. To lay the
illusions which grew popular at that age's latter end, Malthus disclosed
a Devil. For half a century all serious economical writings held that
Devil in clear prospect. For the next half century he was chained up and
out of sight. Now perhaps we have loosed him again.

What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age
was which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the
population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of
comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this
lot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at
all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom
life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences,
comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most
powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by
telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the
whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect
their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and
by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new
enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or
even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could
decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the
townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy
or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished
it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate
without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the
neighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as
might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign
quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs,
bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself
greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But,
most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal,
certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement,
and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The
projects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of racial and
cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclusion, which
were to play the serpent to this paradise, were little more than the
amusements of his daily newspaper, and appeared to exercise almost no
influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life, the
internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice.

It will assist us to appreciate the character and consequences of the
Peace which we have imposed on our enemies, if I elucidate a little
further some of the chief unstable elements already present when war
broke out, in the economic life of Europe.


I. _Population_

In 1870 Germany had a population of about 40,000,000. By 1892 this
figure had risen to 50,000,000, and by June 30, 1914, to about
68,000,000. In the years immediately preceding the war the annual
increase was about 850,000, of whom an insignificant proportion
emigrated.[1] This great increase was only rendered possible by a
far-reaching transformation of the economic structure of the country.
From being agricultural and mainly self-supporting, Germany transformed
herself into a vast and complicated industrial machine, dependent for
its working on the equipoise of many factors outside Germany as well as
within. Only by operating this machine, continuously and at full blast,
could she find occupation at home for her increasing population and the
means of purchasing their subsistence from abroad. The German machine
was like a top which to maintain its equilibrium must spin ever faster
and faster.

In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which grew from about 40,000,000 in 1890
to at least 50,000,000 at the outbreak of war, the same tendency was
present in a less degree, the annual excess of births over deaths being
about half a million, out of which, however, there was an annual
emigration of some quarter of a million persons.

To understand the present situation, we must apprehend with vividness
what an extraordinary center of population the development of the
Germanic system had enabled Central Europe to become. Before the war the
population of Germany and Austria-Hungary together not only
substantially exceeded that of the United States, but was about equal to
that of the whole of North America. In these numbers, situated within a
compact territory, lay the military strength of the Central Powers. But
these same numbers--for even the war has not appreciably diminished
them[2]--if deprived of the means of life, remain a hardly less danger
to European order.

European Russia increased her population in a degree even greater than
Germany--from less than 100,000,000 in 1890 to about 150,000,000 at the
outbreak of war;[3] and in the year immediately preceding 1914 the
excess of births over deaths in Russia as a whole was at the prodigious
rate of two millions per annum. This inordinate growth in the population
of Russia, which has not been widely noticed in England, has been
nevertheless one of the most significant facts of recent years.

The great events of history are often due to secular changes in the
growth of population and other fundamental economic causes, which,
escaping by their gradual character the notice of contemporary
observers, are attributed to the follies of statesmen or the fanaticism
of atheists. Thus the extraordinary occurrences of the past two years in
Russia, that vast upheaval of Society, which has overturned what seemed
most stable--religion, the basis of property, the ownership of land, as
well as forms of government and the hierarchy of classes--may owe more
to the deep influences of expanding numbers than to Lenin or to
Nicholas; and the disruptive powers of excessive national fecundity may
have played a greater part in bursting the bonds of convention than
either the power of ideas or the errors of autocracy.


II. _Organization_

The delicate organization by which these peoples lived depended partly
on factors internal to the system.

The interference of frontiers and of tariffs was reduced to a minimum,
and not far short of three hundred millions of people lived within the
three Empires of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. The various
currencies, which were all maintained on a stable basis in relation to
gold and to one another, facilitated the easy flow of capital and of
trade to an extent the full value of which we only realize now, when we
are deprived of its advantages. Over this great area there was an almost
absolute security of property and of person.

These factors of order, security, and uniformity, which Europe had never
before enjoyed over so wide and populous a territory or for so long a
period, prepared the way for the organization of that vast mechanism of
transport, coal distribution, and foreign trade which made possible an
industrial order of life in the dense urban centers of new population.
This is too well known to require detailed substantiation with figures.
But it may be illustrated by the figures for coal, which has been the
key to the industrial growth of Central Europe hardly less than of
England; the output of German coal grew from 30,000,000 tons in 1871 to
70,000,000 tons in 1890, 110,000,000 tons in 1900, and 190,000,000 tons
in 1913.

Round Germany as a central support the rest of the European economic
system grouped itself, and on the prosperity and enterprise of Germany
the prosperity of the rest of the Continent mainly depended. The
increasing pace of Germany gave her neighbors an outlet for their
products, in exchange for which the enterprise of the German merchant
supplied them with their chief requirements at a low price.

The statistics of the economic interdependence of Germany and her
neighbors are overwhelming. Germany was the best customer of Russia,
Norway, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria-Hungary; she
was the second best customer of Great Britain, Sweden, and Denmark; and
the third best customer of France. She was the largest source of supply
to Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Italy,
Austria-Hungary, Roumania, and Bulgaria; and the second largest source
of supply to Great Britain, Belgium, and France.

In our own case we sent more exports to Germany than to any other
country in the world except India, and we bought more from her than from
any other country in the world except the United States.

There was no European country except those west of Germany which did not
do more than a quarter of their total trade with her; and in the case of
Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Holland the proportion was far greater.

Germany not only furnished these countries with trade, but, in the case
of some of them, supplied a great part of the capital needed for their
own development. Of Germany's pre-war foreign investments, amounting in
all to about $6,250,000,000, not far short of $2,500,000,000 was
invested in Russia, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Roumania, and Turkey.[4]
And by the system of "peaceful penetration" she gave these countries not
only capital, but, what they needed hardly less, organization. The whole
of Europe east of the Rhine thus fell into the German industrial orbit,
and its economic life was adjusted accordingly.

But these internal factors would not have been sufficient to enable the
population to support itself without the co-operation of external
factors also and of certain general dispositions common to the whole of
Europe. Many of the circumstances already treated were true of Europe as
a whole, and were not peculiar to the Central Empires. But all of what
follows was common to the whole European system.


III. _The Psychology of Society_

Europe was so organized socially and economically as to secure the
maximum accumulation of capital. While there was some continuous
improvement in the daily conditions of life of the mass of the
population, Society was so framed as to throw a great part of the
increased income into the control of the class least likely to consume
it. The new rich of the nineteenth century were not brought up to large
expenditures, and preferred the power which investment gave them to the
pleasures of immediate consumption. In fact, it was precisely the
_inequality_ of the distribution of wealth which made possible those
vast accumulations of fixed wealth and of capital improvements which
distinguished that age from all others. Herein lay, in fact, the main
justification of the Capitalist System. If the rich had spent their new
wealth on their own enjoyments, the world would long ago have found such
a rÈgime intolerable. But like bees they saved and accumulated, not less
to the advantage of the whole community because they themselves held
narrower ends in prospect.

The immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit
of mankind, were built up during the half century before the war, could
never have come about in a Society where wealth was divided equitably.
The railways of the world, which that age built as a monument to
posterity, were, not less than the Pyramids of Egypt, the work of labor
which was not free to consume in immediate enjoyment the full equivalent
of its efforts.

Thus this remarkable system depended for its growth on a double bluff or
deception. On the one hand the laboring classes accepted from ignorance
or powerlessness, or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom,
convention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into
accepting, a situation in which they could call their own very little of
the cake that they and Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to
produce. And on the other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to
call the best part of the cake theirs and were theoretically free to
consume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very
little of it in practice. The duty of "saving" became nine-tenths of
virtue and the growth of the cake the object of true religion. There
grew round the non-consumption of the cake all those instincts of
puritanism which in other ages has withdrawn itself from the world and
has neglected the arts of production as well as those of enjoyment. And
so the cake increased; but to what end was not clearly contemplated.
Individuals would be exhorted not so much to abstain as to defer, and to
cultivate the pleasures of security and anticipation. Saving was for old
age or for your children; but this was only in theory,--the virtue of
the cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you nor by
your children after you.

In writing thus I do not necessarily disparage the practices of that
generation. In the unconscious recesses of its being Society knew what
it was about. The cake was really very small in proportion to the
appetites of consumption, and no one, if it were shared all round, would
be much the better off by the cutting of it. Society was working not
for the small pleasures of to-day but for the future security and
improvement of the race,--in fact for "progress." If only the cake were
not cut but was allowed to grow in the geometrical proportion predicted
by Malthus of population, but not less true of compound interest,
perhaps a day might come when there would at last be enough to go round,
and when posterity could enter into the enjoyment of _our_ labors. In
that day overwork, overcrowding, and underfeeding would have come to an
end, and men, secure of the comforts and necessities of the body, could
proceed to the nobler exercises of their faculties. One geometrical
ratio might cancel another, and the nineteenth century was able to
forget the fertility of the species in a contemplation of the dizzy
virtues of compound interest.

There were two pitfalls in this prospect: lest, population still
outstripping accumulation, our self-denials promote not happiness but
numbers; and lest the cake be after all consumed, prematurely, in war,
the consumer of all such hopes.

But these thoughts lead too far from my present purpose. I seek only to
point out that the principle of accumulation based on inequality was a
vital part of the pre-war order of Society and of progress as we then
understood it, and to emphasize that this principle depended on unstable
psychological conditions, which it may be impossible to recreate. It
was not natural for a population, of whom so few enjoyed the comforts of
life, to accumulate so hugely. The war has disclosed the possibility of
consumption to all and the vanity of abstinence to many. Thus the bluff
is discovered; the laboring classes may be no longer willing to forego
so largely, and the capitalist classes, no longer confident of the
future, may seek to enjoy more fully their liberties of consumption so
long as they last, and thus precipitate the hour of their confiscation.


IV. _The Relation of the Old World to the New_

The accumulative habits of Europe before the war were the necessary
condition of the greatest of the external factors which maintained the
European equipoise.

Of the surplus capital goods accumulated by Europe a substantial part
was exported abroad, where its investment made possible the development
of the new resources of food, materials, and transport, and at the same
time enabled the Old World to stake out a claim in the natural wealth
and virgin potentialities of the New. This last factor came to be of the
vastest importance. The Old World employed with an immense prudence the
annual tribute it was thus entitled to draw. The benefit of cheap and
abundant supplies resulting from the new developments which its surplus
capital had made possible, was, it is true, enjoyed and not postponed.
But the greater part of the money interest accruing on these foreign
investments was reinvested and allowed to accumulate, as a reserve (it
was then hoped) against the less happy day when the industrial labor of
Europe could no longer purchase on such easy terms the produce of other
continents, and when the due balance would be threatened between its
historical civilizations and the multiplying races of other climates and
environments. Thus the whole of the European races tended to benefit
alike from the development of new resources whether they pursued their
culture at home or adventured it abroad.

Even before the war, however, the equilibrium thus established between
old civilizations and new resources was being threatened. The prosperity
of Europe was based on the facts that, owing to the large exportable
surplus of foodstuffs in America, she was able to purchase food at a
cheap rate measured in terms of the labor required to produce her own
exports, and that, as a result of her previous investments of capital,
she was entitled to a substantial amount annually without any payment in
return at all. The second of these factors then seemed out of danger,
but, as a result of the growth of population overseas, chiefly in the
United States, the first was not so secure.

When first the virgin soils of America came into bearing, the
proportions of the population of those continents themselves, and
consequently of their own local requirements, to those of Europe were
very small. As lately as 1890 Europe had a population three times that
of North and South America added together. But by 1914 the domestic
requirements of the United States for wheat were approaching their
production, and the date was evidently near when there would be an
exportable surplus only in years of exceptionally favorable harvest.
Indeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are
estimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five
years 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards
stringency was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in
a steady increase of real cost. That is to say, taking the world as a
whole, there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an
adequate supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price. The most
favorable factor in the situation was to be found in the extent to which
Central and Western Europe was being fed from the exportable surplus of
Russia and Roumania.

In short, Europe's claim on the resources of the New World was becoming
precarious; the law of diminishing returns was at last reasserting
itself and was making it necessary year by year for Europe to offer a
greater quantity of other commodities to obtain the same amount of
bread; and Europe, therefore, could by no means afford the
disorganization of any of her principal sources of supply.

Much else might be said in an attempt to portray the economic
peculiarities of the Europe of 1914. I have selected for emphasis the
three or four greatest factors of instability,--the instability of an
excessive population dependent for its livelihood on a complicated and
artificial organization, the psychological instability of the laboring
and capitalist classes, and the instability of Europe's claim, coupled
with the completeness of her dependence, on the food supplies of the New
World.

The war had so shaken this system as to endanger the life of Europe
altogether. A great part of the Continent was sick and dying; its
population was greatly in excess of the numbers for which a livelihood
was available; its organization was destroyed, its transport system
ruptured, and its food supplies terribly impaired.

It was the task of the Peace Conference to honor engagements and to
satisfy justice; but not less to re-establish life and to heal wounds.
These tasks were dictated as much by prudence as by the magnanimity
which the wisdom of antiquity approved in victors. We will examine in
the following chapters the actual character of the Peace.

[5] Even since 1914 the population of the United States has
increased by seven or eight millions. As their annual consumption of
wheat per head is not less than 6 bushels, the pre-war scale of
production in the United States would only show a substantial surplus
over present domestic requirements in about one year out of five. We
have been saved for the moment by the great harvests of 1918 and 1919,
which have been called forth by Mr. Hoover's guaranteed price. But the
United States can hardly be expected to continue indefinitely to raise
by a substantial figure the cost of living in its own country, in order
to provide wheat for a Europe which cannot pay for it.




CHAPTER III

THE CONFERENCE


In Chapters IV. and V. I shall study in some detail the economic and
financial provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Germany. But it will be
easier to appreciate the true origin of many of these terms if we
examine here some of the personal factors which influenced their
preparation. In attempting this task, I touch, inevitably, questions of
motive, on which spectators are liable to error and are not entitled to
take on themselves the responsibilities of final judgment. Yet, if I
seem in this chapter to assume sometimes the liberties which are
habitual to historians, but which, in spite of the greater knowledge
with which we speak, we generally hesitate to assume towards
contemporaries, let the reader excuse me when he remembers how greatly,
if it is to understand its destiny, the world needs light, even if it is
partial and uncertain, on the complex struggle of human will and
purpose, not yet finished, which, concentrated in the persons of four
individuals in a manner never paralleled, made them, in the first months
of 1919, the microcosm of mankind.

In those parts of the Treaty with which I am here concerned, the lead
was taken by the French, in the sense that it was generally they who
made in the first instance the most definite and the most extreme
proposals. This was partly a matter of tactics. When the final result is
expected to be a compromise, it is often prudent to start from an
extreme position; and the French anticipated at the outset--like most
other persons--a double process of compromise, first of all to suit the
ideas of their allies and associates, and secondly in the course of the
Peace Conference proper with the Germans themselves. These tactics were
justified by the event. Clemenceau gained a reputation for moderation
with his colleagues in Council by sometimes throwing over with an air of
intellectual impartiality the more extreme proposals of his ministers;
and much went through where the American and British critics were
naturally a little ignorant of the true point at issue, or where too
persistent criticism by France's allies put them in a position which
they felt as invidious, of always appearing to take the enemy's part and
to argue his case. Where, therefore, British and American interests were
not seriously involved their criticism grew slack, and some provisions
were thus passed which the French themselves did not take very
seriously, and for which the eleventh-hour decision to allow no
discussion with the Germans removed the opportunity of remedy.

But, apart from tactics, the French had a policy. Although Clemenceau
might curtly abandon the claims of a Klotz or a Loucheur, or close his
eyes with an air of fatigue when French interests were no longer
involved in the discussion, he knew which points were vital, and these
he abated little. In so far as the main economic lines of the Treaty
represent an intellectual idea, it is the idea of France and of
Clemenceau.

Clemenceau was by far the most eminent member of the Council of Four,
and he had taken the measure of his colleagues. He alone both had an
idea and had considered it in all its consequences. His age, his
character, his wit, and his appearance joined to give him objectivity
and a, defined outline in an environment of confusion. One could not
despise Clemenceau or dislike him, but only take a different view as to
the nature of civilized man, or indulge, at least, a different hope.

The figure and bearing of Clemenceau are universally familiar. At the
Council of Four he wore a square-tailed coat of very good, thick black
broadcloth, and on his hands, which were never uncovered, gray suede
gloves; his boots were of thick black leather, very good, but of a
country style, and sometimes fastened in front, curiously, by a buckle
instead of laces. His seat in the room in the President's house, where
the regular meetings of the Council of Four were held (as distinguished
from their private and unattended conferences in a smaller chamber
below), was on a square brocaded chair in the middle of the semicircle
facing the fireplace, with Signor Orlando on his left, the President
next by the fireplace, and the Prime Minister opposite on the other side
of the fireplace on his right. He carried no papers and no portfolio,
and was unattended by any personal secretary, though several French
ministers and officials appropriate to the particular matter in hand
would be present round him. His walk, his hand, and his voice were not
lacking in vigor, but he bore nevertheless, especially after the attempt
upon him, the aspect of a very old man conserving his strength for
important occasions. He spoke seldom, leaving the initial statement of
the French case to his ministers or officials; he closed his eyes often
and sat back in his chair with an impassive face of parchment, his gray
gloved hands clasped in front of him. A short sentence, decisive or
cynical, was generally sufficient, a question, an unqualified
abandonment of his ministers, whose face would not be saved, or a
display of obstinacy reinforced by a few words in a piquantly delivered
English.[6] But speech and passion were not lacking when they were
wanted, and the sudden outburst of words, often followed by a fit of
deep coughing from the chest, produced their impression rather by force
and surprise than by persuasion.

Not infrequently Mr. Lloyd George, after delivering a speech in English,
would, during the period of its interpretation into French, cross the
hearthrug to the President to reinforce his case by some _ad hominem_
argument in private conversation, or to sound the ground for a
compromise,--and this would sometimes be the signal for a general
upheaval and disorder. The President's advisers would press round him, a
moment later the British experts would dribble across to learn the
result or see that all was well, and next the French would be there, a
little suspicious lest the others were arranging something behind them,
until all the room were on their feet and conversation was general in
both languages. My last and most vivid impression is of such a
scene--the President and the Prime Minister as the center of a surging
mob and a babel of sound, a welter of eager, impromptu compromises and
counter-compromises, all sound and fury signifying nothing, on what was
an unreal question anyhow, the great issues of the morning's meeting
forgotten and neglected; and Clemenceau silent and aloof on the
outskirts--for nothing which touched the security of France was
forward--throned, in his gray gloves, on the brocade chair, dry in soul
and empty of hope, very old and tired, but surveying the scene with a
cynical and almost impish air; and when at last silence was restored and
the company had returned to their places, it was to discover that he had
disappeared.

He felt about France what Pericles felt of Athens--unique value in her,
nothing else mattering; but his theory of politics was Bismarck's. He
had one illusion--France; and one disillusion--mankind, including
Frenchmen, and his colleagues not least. His principles for the peace
can be expressed simply. In the first place, he was a foremost believer
in the view of German psychology that the German understands and can
understand nothing but intimidation, that he is without generosity or
remorse in negotiation, that there is no advantage he will not take of
you, and no extent to which he will not demean himself for profit, that
he is without honor, pride, or mercy. Therefore you must never negotiate
with a German or conciliate him; you must dictate to him. On no other
terms will he respect you, or will you prevent him from cheating you.
But it is doubtful how far he thought these characteristics peculiar to
Germany, or whether his candid view of some other nations was
fundamentally different. His philosophy had, therefore, no place for
"sentimentality" in international relations. Nations are real things, of
whom you love one and feel for the rest indifference--or hatred. The
glory of the nation you love is a desirable end,--but generally to be
obtained at your neighbor's expense. The politics of power are
inevitable, and there is nothing very new to learn about this war or the
end it was fought for; England had destroyed, as in each preceding
century, a trade rival; a mighty chapter had been closed in the secular
struggle between the glories of Germany and of France. Prudence required
some measure of lip service to the "ideals" of foolish Americans and
hypocritical Englishmen; but it would be stupid to believe that there is
much room in the world, as it really is, for such affairs as the League
of Nations, or any sense in the principle of self-determination except
as an ingenious formula for rearranging the balance of power in one's
own interests.

These, however, are generalities. In tracing the practical details of
the Peace which he thought necessary for the power and the security of
France, we must go back to the historical causes which had operated
during his lifetime. Before the Franco-German war the populations of
France and Germany were approximately equal; but the coal and iron and
shipping of Germany were in their infancy, and the wealth of France was
greatly superior. Even after the loss of Alsace-Lorraine there was no
great discrepancy between the real resources of the two countries. But
in the intervening period the relative position had changed completely.
By 1914 the population of Germany was nearly seventy per cent in excess
of that of France; she had become one of the first manufacturing and
trading nations of the world; her technical skill and her means for the
production of future wealth were unequaled. France on the other hand had
a stationary or declining population, and, relatively to others, had
fallen seriously behind in wealth and in the power to produce it.

In spite, therefore, of France's victorious issue from the present
struggle (with the aid, this time, of England and America), her future
position remained precarious in the eyes of one who took the view that
European civil war is to be regarded as a normal, or at least a
recurrent, state of affairs for the future, and that the sort of
conflicts between organized great powers which have occupied the past
hundred years will also engage the next. According to this vision of the
future, European history is to be a perpetual prize-fight, of which
France has won this round, but of which this round is certainly not the
last. From the belief that essentially the old order does not change,
being based on human nature which is always the same, and from a
consequent skepticism of all that class of doctrine which the League of
Nations stands for, the policy of France and of Clemenceau followed
logically. For a Peace of magnanimity or of fair and equal treatment,
based on such "ideology" as the Fourteen Points of the President, could
only have the effect of shortening the interval of Germany's recovery
and hastening the day when she will once again hurl at France her
greater numbers and her superior resources and technical skill. Hence
the necessity of "guarantees"; and each guarantee that was taken, by
increasing irritation and thus the probability of a subsequent
_Revanche_ by Germany, made necessary yet further provisions to crush.
Thus, as soon as this view of the world is adopted and the other
discarded, a demand for a Carthaginian Peace is inevitable, to the full
extent of the momentary power to impose it. For Clemenceau made no
pretense of considering himself bound by the Fourteen Points and left
chiefly to others such concoctions as were necessary from time to time
to save the scruples or the face of the President.

So far as possible, therefore, it was the policy of France to set the
clock back and to undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had
accomplished. By loss of territory and other measures her population was
to be curtailed; but chiefly the economic system, upon which she
depended for her new strength, the vast fabric built upon iron, coal,
and transport must be destroyed. If France could seize, even in part,
what Germany was compelled to drop, the inequality of strength between
the two rivals for European hegemony might be remedied for many
generations.

Hence sprang those cumulative provisions for the destruction of highly
organized economic life which we shall examine in the next chapter.

This is the policy of an old man, whose most vivid impressions and most
lively imagination are of the past and not of the future. He sees the
issue in terms, of France and Germany not of humanity and of European
civilization struggling forwards to a new order. The war has bitten into
his consciousness somewhat differently from ours, and he neither expects
nor hopes that we are at the threshold of a new age.

It happens, however, that it is not only an ideal question that is at
issue. My purpose in this book is to show that the Carthaginian Peace is
not _practically_ right or possible. Although the school of thought from
which it springs is aware of the economic factor, it overlooks,
nevertheless, the deeper economic tendencies which are to govern the
future. The clock cannot be set back. You cannot restore Central Europe
to 1870 without setting up such strains in the European structure and
letting loose such human and spiritual forces as, pushing beyond
frontiers and races, will overwhelm not only you and your "guarantees,"
but your institutions, and the existing order of your Society.

By what legerdemain was this policy substituted for the Fourteen Points,
and how did the President come to accept it? The answer to these
questions is difficult and depends on elements of character and
psychology and on the subtle influence of surroundings, which are hard
to detect and harder still to describe. But, if ever the action of a
single individual matters, the collapse of The President has been one of
the decisive moral events of history; and I must make an attempt to
explain it. What a place the President held in the hearts and hopes of
the world when he sailed to us in the _George Washington!_ What a great
man came to Europe in those early days of our victory!

In November, 1918, the armies of Foch and the words of Wilson had
brought us sudden escape from what was swallowing up all we cared for.
The conditions seemed favorable beyond any expectation. The victory was
so complete that fear need play no part in the settlement. The enemy
had laid down his arms in reliance on a solemn compact as to the general
character of the Peace, the terms of which seemed to assure a settlement
of justice and magnanimity and a fair hope for a restoration of the
broken current of life. To make assurance certain the President was
coming himself to set the seal on his work.

When President Wilson left Washington he enjoyed a prestige and a moral
influence throughout the world unequaled in history. His bold and
measured words carried to the peoples of Europe above and beyond the
voices of their own politicians. The enemy peoples trusted him to carry
out the compact he had made with them; and the Allied peoples
acknowledged him not as a victor only but almost as a prophet. In
addition to this moral influence the realities of power were in his
hands. The American armies were at the height of their numbers,
discipline, and equipment. Europe was in complete dependence on the food
supplies of the United States; and financially she was even more
absolutely at their mercy. Europe not only already owed the United
States more than she could pay; but only a large measure of further
assistance could save her from starvation and bankruptcy. Never had a
philosopher held such weapons wherewith to bind the princes of this
world. How the crowds of the European capitals pressed about the
carriage of the President! With what curiosity, anxiety, and hope we
sought a glimpse of the features and bearing of the man of destiny who,
coming from the West, was to bring healing to the wounds of the ancient
parent of his civilization and lay for us the foundations of the future.

The disillusion was so complete, that some of those who had trusted most
hardly dared speak of it. Could it be true? they asked of those who
returned from Paris. Was the Treaty really as bad as it seemed? What had
happened to the President? What weakness or what misfortune had led to
so extraordinary, so unlooked-for a betrayal?

Yet the causes were very ordinary and human. The President was not a
hero or a prophet; he was not even a philosopher; but a generously
intentioned man, with many of the weaknesses of other human beings, and
lacking that dominating intellectual equipment which would have been
necessary to cope with the subtle and dangerous spellbinders whom a
tremendous clash of forces and personalities had brought to the top as
triumphant masters in the swift game of give and take, face to face in
Council,--a game of which he had no experience at all.

We had indeed quite a wrong idea of the President. We knew him to be
solitary and aloof, and believed him very strong-willed and obstinate.
We did not figure him as a man of detail, but the clearness with which
he had taken hold of certain main ideas would, we thought, in
combination with his tenacity, enable him to sweep through cobwebs.
Besides these qualities he would have the objectivity, the cultivation,
and the wide knowledge of the student. The great distinction of language
which had marked his famous Notes seemed to indicate a man of lofty and
powerful imagination. His portraits indicated a fine presence and a
commanding delivery. With all this he had attained and held with
increasing authority the first position in a country where the arts of
the politician are not neglected. All of which, without expecting the
impossible, seemed a fine combination of qualities for the matter in
hand.

The first impression of Mr. Wilson at close quarters was to impair some
but not all of these illusions. His head and features were finely cut
and exactly like his photographs, and the muscles of his neck and the
carriage of his head were distinguished. But, like Odysseus, the
President looked wiser when he was seated; and his hands, though capable
and fairly strong, were wanting in sensitiveness and finesse. The first
glance at the President suggested not only that, whatever else he might
be, his temperament was not primarily that of the student or the
scholar, but that he had not much even of that culture of the world
which marks M. Clemenceau and Mr. Balfour as exquisitely cultivated
gentlemen of their class and generation. But more serious than this, he
was not only insensitive to his surroundings in the external sense, he
was not sensitive to his environment at all. What chance could such a
man have against Mr. Lloyd George's unerring, almost medium-like,
sensibility to every one immediately round him? To see the British Prime
Minister watching the company, with six or seven senses not available to
ordinary men, judging character, motive, and subconscious impulse,
perceiving what each was thinking and even what each was going to say
next, and compounding with telepathic instinct the argument or appeal
best suited to the vanity, weakness, or self-interest of his immediate
auditor, was to realize that the poor President would be playing blind
man's buff in that party. Never could a man have stepped into the parlor
a more perfect and predestined victim to the finished accomplishments of
the Prime Minister. The Old World was tough in wickedness anyhow; the
Old World's heart of stone might blunt the sharpest blade of the bravest
knight-errant. But this blind and deaf Don Quixote was entering a cavern
where the swift and glittering blade was in the hands of the adversary.

But if the President was not the philosopher-king, what was he? After
all he was a man who had spent much of his life at a University. He was
by no means a business man or an ordinary party politician, but a man of
force, personality, and importance. What, then, was his temperament?

The clue once found was illuminating. The President was like a
Nonconformist minister, perhaps a Presbyterian. His thought and his
temperament wore essentially theological not intellectual, with all the
strength and the weakness of that manner of thought, feeling, and
expression. It is a type of which there are not now in England and
Scotland such magnificent specimens as formerly; but this description,
nevertheless, will give the ordinary Englishman the distinctest
impression of the President.

With this picture of him in mind, we can return to the actual course of
events. The President's program for the World, as set forth in his
speeches and his Notes, had displayed a spirit and a purpose so
admirable that the last desire of his sympathizers was to criticize
details,--the details, they felt, were quite rightly not filled in at
present, but would be in due course. It was commonly believed at the
commencement of the Paris Conference that the President had thought out,
with the aid of a large body of advisers, a comprehensive scheme not
only for the League of Nations, but for the embodiment of the Fourteen
Points in an actual Treaty of Peace. But in fact the President had
thought out nothing; when it came to practice his ideas were nebulous
and incomplete. He had no plan, no scheme, no constructive ideas
whatever for clothing with the flesh of life the commandments which he
had thundered from the White House. He could have preached a sermon on
any of them or have addressed a stately prayer to the Almighty for their
fulfilment; but he could not frame their concrete application to the
actual state of Europe.

He not only had no proposals in detail, but he was in many respects,
perhaps inevitably, ill-informed as to European conditions. And not only
was he ill-informed--that was true of Mr. Lloyd George also--but his
mind was slow and unadaptable. The President's slowness amongst the
Europeans was noteworthy. He could not, all in a minute, take in what
the rest were saying, size up the situation with a glance, frame a
reply, and meet the case by a slight change of ground; and he was
liable, therefore, to defeat by the mere swiftness, apprehension, and
agility of a Lloyd George. There can seldom have been a statesman of the
first rank more incompetent than the President in the agilities of the
council chamber. A moment often arrives when substantial victory is
yours if by some slight appearance of a concession you can save the face
of the opposition or conciliate them by a restatement of your proposal
helpful to them and not injurious to anything essential to yourself. The
President was not equipped with this simple and usual artfulness. His
mind was too slow and unresourceful to be ready with _any_ alternatives.
The President was capable of digging his toes in and refusing to budge,
as he did over Fiume. But he had no other mode of defense, and it needed
as a rule but little manoeuvering by his opponents to prevent matters
from coming to such a head until it was too late. By pleasantness and an
appearance of conciliation, the President would be manoeuvered off his
ground, would miss the moment for digging his toes in, and, before he
knew where he had been got to, it was too late. Besides, it is
impossible month after month in intimate and ostensibly friendly
converse between close associates, to be digging the toes in all the
time. Victory would only have been possible to one who had always a
sufficiently lively apprehension of the position as a whole to reserve
his fire and know for certain the rare exact moments for decisive
action. And for that the President was far too slow-minded and
bewildered.

He did not remedy these defects by seeking aid from the collective
wisdom of his lieutenants. He had gathered round him for the economic
chapters of the Treaty a very able group of business men; but they were
inexperienced in public affairs, and knew (with one or two exceptions)
as little of Europe as he did, and they were only called in irregularly
as he might need them for a particular purpose. Thus the aloofness which
had been found effective in Washington was maintained, and the abnormal
reserve of his nature did not allow near him any one who aspired to
moral equality or the continuous exercise of influence. His
fellow-plenipotentiaries were dummies; and even the trusted Colonel
House, with vastly more knowledge of men and of Europe than the
President, from whose sensitiveness the President's dullness had gained
so much, fell into the background as time went on. All this was
encouraged by his colleagues on the Council of Four, who, by the
break-up of the Council of Ten, completed the isolation which the
President's own temperament had initiated. Thus day after day and week
after week, he allowed himself to be closeted, unsupported, unadvised,
and alone, with men much sharper than himself, in situations of supreme
difficulty, where he needed for success every description of resource,
fertility, and knowledge. He allowed himself to be drugged by their
atmosphere, to discuss on the basis of their plans and of their data,
and to be led along their paths.

These and other various causes combined to produce the following
situation. The reader must remember that the processes which are here
compressed into a few pages took place slowly, gradually, insidiously,
over a period of about five months.

As the President had thought nothing out, the Council was generally
working on the basis of a French or British draft. He had to take up,
therefore, a persistent attitude of obstruction, criticism, and
negation, if the draft was to become at all in line with his own ideas
and purpose. If he was met on some points with apparent generosity (for
there was always a safe margin of quite preposterous suggestions which
no one took seriously), it was difficult for him not to yield on others.
Compromise was inevitable, and never to compromise on the essential,
very difficult. Besides, he was soon made to appear to be taking the
German part and laid himself open to the suggestion (to which he was
foolishly and unfortunately sensitive) of being "pro-German."

After a display of much principle and dignity in the early days of the
Council of Ten, he discovered that there were certain very important
points in the program of his French, British, or Italian colleague, as
the case might be, of which he was incapable of securing the surrender
by the methods of secret diplomacy. What then was he to do in the last
resort? He could let the Conference drag on an endless length by the
exercise of sheer obstinacy. He could break it up and return to America
in a rage with nothing settled. Or he could attempt an appeal to the
world over the heads of the Conference. These were wretched
alternatives, against each of which a great deal could be said. They
were also very risky,--especially for a politician. The President's
mistaken policy over the Congressional election had weakened his
personal position in his own country, and it was by no means certain
that the American public would support him in a position of
intransigeancy. It would mean a campaign in which the issues would be
clouded by every sort of personal and party consideration, and who could
say if right would triumph in a struggle which would certainly not be
decided on its merits? Besides, any open rupture with his colleagues
would certainly bring upon his head the blind passions of "anti-German"
resentment with which the public of all allied countries were still
inspired. They would not listen to his arguments. They would not be cool
enough to treat the issue as one of international morality or of the
right governance of Europe. The cry would simply be that, for various
sinister and selfish reasons, the President wished "to let the Hun off."
The almost unanimous voice of the French and British Press could be
anticipated. Thus, if he threw down the gage publicly he might be
defeated. And if he were defeated, would not the final Peace be far
worse than if he were to retain his prestige and endeavor to make it as
good as the limiting conditions of European politics would allow, him?
But above all, if he were defeated, would he not lose the League of
Nations? And was not this, after all, by far the most important issue
for the future happiness of the world? The Treaty would be altered and
softened by time. Much in it which now seemed so vital would become
trifling, and much which was impracticable would for that very reason
never happen. But the League, even in an imperfect form, was permanent;
it was the first commencement of a new principle in the government of
the world; Truth and Justice in international relations could not be
established in a few months,--they must be born in due course by the
slow gestation of the League. Clemenceau had been clever enough to let
it be seen that he would swallow the League at a price.

At the crisis of his fortunes the President was a lonely man. Caught up
in the toils of the Old World, he stood in great need of sympathy, of
moral support, of the enthusiasm of masses. But buried in the
Conference, stifled in the hot and poisoned atmosphere of Paris, no echo
reached him from the outer world, and no throb of passion, sympathy, or
encouragement from his silent constituents in all countries. He felt
that the blaze of popularity which had greeted his arrival in Europe
was already dimmed; the Paris Press jeered at him openly; his political
opponents at home were taking advantage of his absence to create an
atmosphere against him; England was cold, critical, and unresponsive. He
had so formed his _entourage_ that he did not receive through private
channels the current of faith and enthusiasm of which the public sources
seemed dammed up. He needed, but lacked, the added strength of
collective faith. The German terror still overhung us, and even the
sympathetic public was very cautious; the enemy must not be encouraged,
our friends must be supported, this was not the time for discord or
agitations, the President must be trusted to do his best. And in this
drought the flower of the President's faith withered and dried up.

Thus it came to pass that the President countermanded the _George
Washington_, which, in a moment of well-founded rage, he had ordered to
be in readiness to carry him from the treacherous halls of Paris back to
the seat of his authority, where he could have felt himself again. But
as soon, alas, as he had taken the road of compromise, the defects,
already indicated, of his temperament and of his equipment, were fatally
apparent. He could take the high line; he could practise obstinacy; he
could write Notes from Sinai or Olympus; he could remain unapproachable
in the White House or even in the Council of Ten and be safe. But if he
once stepped down to the intimate equality of the Four, the game was
evidently up.

Now it was that what I have called his theological or Presbyterian
temperament became dangerous. Having decided that some concessions were
unavoidable, he might have sought by firmness and address and the use of
the financial power of the United States to secure as much as he could
of the substance, even at some sacrifice of the letter. But the
President was not capable of so clear an understanding with himself as
this implied. He was too conscientious. Although compromises were now
necessary, he remained a man of principle and the Fourteen Points a
contract absolutely binding upon him. He would do nothing that was not
honorable; he would do nothing that was not just and right; he would do
nothing that was contrary to his great profession of faith. Thus,
without any abatement of the verbal inspiration of the Fourteen Points,
they became a document for gloss and interpretation and for all the
intellectual apparatus of self-deception, by which, I daresay, the
President's forefathers had persuaded themselves that the course they
thought it necessary to take was consistent with every syllable of the
Pentateuch.

The President's attitude to his colleagues had now become: I want to
meet you so far as I can; I see your difficulties and I should like to
be able to agree to what you propose; but I can do nothing that is not
just and right, and you must first of all show me that what you want
does really fall within the words of the pronouncements which are
binding on me. Then began the weaving of that web of sophistry and
Jesuitical exegesis that was finally to clothe with insincerity the
language and substance of the whole Treaty. The word was issued to the
witches of all Paris:

    Fair is foul, and foul is fair,
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.

The subtlest sophisters and most hypocritical draftsmen were set to
work, and produced many ingenious exercises which might have deceived
for more than an hour a cleverer man than the President.

Thus instead of saying that German-Austria is prohibited from uniting
with Germany except by leave of France (which would be inconsistent with
the principle of self-determination), the Treaty, with delicate
draftsmanship, states that "Germany acknowledges and will respect
strictly the independence of Austria, within the frontiers which may be
fixed in a Treaty between that State and the Principal Allied and
Associated Powers; she agrees that this independence shall be
inalienable, except with the consent of the Council of the League of
Nations," which sounds, but is not, quite different. And who knows but
that the President forgot that another part of the Treaty provides that
for this purpose the Council of the League must be _unanimous_.

Instead of giving Danzig to Poland, the Treaty establishes Danzig as a
"Free" City, but includes this "Free" City within the Polish Customs
frontier, entrusts to Poland the control of the river and railway
system, and provides that "the Polish Government shall undertake the
conduct of the foreign relations of the Free City of Danzig as well as
the diplomatic protection of citizens of that city when abroad."

In placing the river system of Germany under foreign control, the Treaty
speaks of declaring international those "river systems which naturally
provide more than one State with access to the sea, with or without
transhipment from one vessel to another."

Such instances could be multiplied. The honest and intelligible purpose
of French policy, to limit the population of Germany and weaken her
economic system, is clothed, for the President's sake, in the august
language of freedom and international equality.

But perhaps the most decisive moment, in the disintegration of the
President's moral position and the clouding of his mind, was when at
last, to the dismay of his advisers, he allowed himself to be persuaded
that the expenditure of the Allied Governments on pensions and
separation allowances could be fairly regarded as "damage done to the
civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers by German
aggression by land, by sea, and from the air," in a sense in which the
other expenses of the war could not be so regarded. It was a long
theological struggle in which, after the rejection of many different
arguments, the President finally capitulated before a masterpiece of the
sophist's art.

At last the work was finished; and the President's conscience was still
intact. In spite of everything, I believe that his temperament allowed
him to leave Paris a really sincere man; and it is probable that to this
day he is genuinely convinced that the Treaty contains practically
nothing inconsistent with his former professions.

But the work was too complete, and to this was due the last tragic
episode of the drama. The reply of Brockdorff-Rantzau inevitably took
the line that Germany had laid down her arms on the basis of certain
assurances, and that the Treaty in many particulars was not consistent
with these assurances. But this was exactly what the President could not
admit; in the sweat of solitary contemplation and with prayers to God
he had done _nothing_ that was not just and right; for the President to
admit that the German reply had force in it was to destroy his
self-respect and to disrupt the inner equipoise of his soul; and every
instinct of his stubborn nature rose in self-protection. In the language
of medical psychology, to suggest to the President that the Treaty was
an abandonment of his professions was to touch on the raw a Freudian
complex. It was a subject intolerable to discuss, and every subconscious
instinct plotted to defeat its further exploration.

Thus it was that Clemenceau brought to success, what had seemed to be, a
few months before, the extraordinary and impossible proposal that the
Germans should not be heard. If only the President had not been so
conscientious, if only he had not concealed from himself what he had
been doing, even at the last moment he was in, a position to have
recovered lost ground and to have achieved some very considerable
successes. But the President was set. His arms and legs had been spliced
by the surgeons to a certain posture, and they must be broken again
before they could be altered. To his horror, Mr. Lloyd George, desiring
at the last moment all the moderation he dared, discovered that he could
not in five days persuade the President of error in what it had taken
five months to prove to him to be just and right. After all, it was
harder to de-bamboozle this old Presbyterian than it had been to
bamboozle him; for the former involved his belief in and respect for
himself.

Thus in the last act the President stood for stubbornness and a refusal
of conciliations.

CHAPTER IV

THE TREATY


The thoughts which I have expressed in the second chapter were not
present to the mind of Paris. The future life of Europe was not their
concern; its means of livelihood was not their anxiety. Their
preoccupations, good and bad alike, related to frontiers and
nationalities, to the balance of power, to imperial aggrandizements, to
the future enfeeblement of a strong and dangerous enemy, to revenge, and
to the shifting by the victors of their unbearable financial burdens on
to the shoulders of the defeated.

Two rival schemes for the future polity of the world took the
field,--the Fourteen Points of the President, and the Carthaginian Peace
of M. Clemenceau. Yet only one of these was entitled to take the field;
for the enemy had not surrendered unconditionally, but on agreed terms
as to the general character of the Peace.

This aspect of what happened cannot, unfortunately, be passed over with
a word, for in the minds of many Englishmen at least it has been a
subject of very great misapprehension. Many persons believe that the
Armistice Terms constituted the first Contract concluded between the
Allied and Associated Powers and the German Government, and that we
entered the Conference with our hands, free, except so far as these
Armistice Terms might bind us. This was not the case. To make the
position plain, it is necessary briefly to review the history, of the
negotiations which began with the German Note of October 5, 1918, and
concluded with President Wilson's Note of November 5, 1918.

On October 5, 1918, the German Government addressed a brief Note to the
President accepting the Fourteen Points and asking for Peace
negotiations. The President's reply of October 8 asked if he was to
understand definitely that the German Government accepted "the terms
laid down" in Fourteen Points and in his subsequent Addresses and "that
its object in entering into discussion would be only to agree upon the
practical details of their application." He added that the evacuation of
invaded territory must be a prior condition of an Armistice. On October
12 the German Government returned an unconditional affirmative to these
questions;-"its object in entering into discussions would be only to
agree upon practical details of the application of these terms." On
October 14, having received this affirmative answer, the President made
a further communication to make clear the points: (1) that the details
of the Armistice would have to be left to the military advisers of the
United States and the Allies, and must provide absolutely against the
possibility of Germany's resuming hostilities; (2) that submarine
warfare must cease if these conversations were to continue; and (3) that
he required further guarantees of the representative character of the
Government with which he was dealing. On October 20 Germany accepted
points (1) and (2), and pointed out, as regards (3), that she now had a
Constitution and a Government dependent for its authority on the
Reichstag. On October 23 the President announced that, "having received
the solemn and explicit assurance of the German Government that it
unreservedly accepts the terms of peace laid down in his Address to the
Congress of the United States on January 8, 1918 (the Fourteen Points),
and the principles of settlement enunciated in his subsequent Addresses,
particularly the Address of September 27, and that it is ready to
discuss the details of their application," he has communicated the above
correspondence to the Governments of the Allied Powers "with the
suggestion that, if these Governments are disposed to effect peace upon
the terms and principles indicated," they will ask their military
advisers to draw up Armistice Terms of such a character as to "ensure to
the Associated Governments the unrestricted power to safeguard and
enforce the details of the peace to which the German Government has
agreed." At the end of this Note the President hinted more openly than
in that of October 14 at the abdication of the Kaiser. This completes
the preliminary negotiations to which the President alone was a party,
adding without the Governments of the Allied Powers.

On November 5, 1918, the President transmitted to Germany the reply he
had received from the Governments associated with him, and added that
Marshal Foch had been authorized to communicate the terms of an
armistice to properly accredited representatives. In this reply the
Allied Governments, "subject to the qualifications which follow, declare
their willingness to make peace with the Government of Germany on the
terms of peace laid down in the President's Address to Congress of
January 8, 1918, and the principles of settlement enunciated in his
subsequent Addresses." The qualifications in question were two in
number. The first related to the Freedom of the Seas, as to which they
"reserved to themselves complete freedom." The second related to
Reparation and ran as follows:--"Further, in the conditions of peace
laid down in his Address to Congress on the 8th January, 1918 the
President declared that invaded territories must be restored as well as
evacuated and made free. The Allied Governments feel that no doubt
ought to be allowed to exist as to what this provision implies. By it
they understand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage
done to the civilian population of the Allies and to their property by
the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air."[7]

The nature of the Contract between Germany and the Allies resulting from
this exchange of documents is plain and unequivocal. The terms of the
peace are to be in accordance with the Addresses of the President, and
the purpose of the Peace Conference is "to discuss the details of their
application." The circumstances of the Contract were of an unusually
solemn and binding character; for one of the conditions of it was that
Germany should agree to Armistice Terms which were to be such as would
leave her helpless. Germany having rendered herself helpless in reliance
on the Contract, the honor of the Allies was peculiarly involved in
fulfilling their part and, if there were ambiguities, in not using their
position to take advantage of them.

What, then, was the substance of this Contract to which the Allies had
bound themselves? An examination of the documents shows that, although a
large part of the Addresses is concerned with spirit, purpose, and
intention, and not with concrete solutions, and that many questions
requiring a settlement in the Peace Treaty are not touched on,
nevertheless, there are certain questions which they settle definitely.
It is true that within somewhat wide limits the Allies still had a free
hand. Further, it is difficult to apply on a contractual basis those
passages which deal with spirit, purpose, and intention;--every man must
judge for himself whether, in view of them, deception or hypocrisy has
been practised. But there remain, as will be seen below, certain
important issues on which the Contract is unequivocal.

In addition to the Fourteen Points of January 18, 1918, the Addresses of
the President which form part of the material of the Contract are four
in number,--before the Congress on February 11; at Baltimore on April 6;
at Mount Vernon on July 4; and at New York on September 27, the last of
these being specially referred to in the Contract. I venture to select
from these Addresses those engagements of substance, avoiding
repetitions, which are most relevant to the German Treaty. The parts I
omit add to, rather than detract from, those I quote; but they chiefly
relate to intention, and are perhaps too vague and general to be
interpreted contractually.[8]

_The Fourteen Points_.--(3). "The removal, so far as possible, of all
economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade
conditions among _all_ the nations consenting to the Peace and
associating themselves for its maintenance." (4). "Adequate guarantees
_given and taken_ that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest
point consistent with domestic safety." (5). "A free, open-minded, and
absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims," regard being
had to the interests of the populations concerned. (6), (7), (8), and
(11). The evacuation and "restoration" of all invaded territory,
especially of Belgium. To this must be added the rider of the Allies,
claiming compensation for all damage done to civilians and their
property by land, by sea, and from the air (quoted in full above). (8).
The righting of "the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the
matter of Alsace-Lorraine." (13). An independent Poland, including "the
territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations" and "assured a
free and secure access to the sea." (14). The League of Nations.

_Before the Congress, February 11_.--"There shall be no annexations, _no
contributions, no punitive damages_.... Self-determination is not a
mere phrase. It is an imperative principle of action which statesmen
will henceforth ignore at their peril.... Every territorial settlement
involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of
the populations concerned, and not as a part of any mere adjustment or
compromise of claims amongst rival States."

_New York, September 27_.--(1) "The impartial justice meted out must
involve no discrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and
those to whom we do not wish to be just." (2) "No special or separate
interest of any single nation or any group of nations can be made the
basis of any part of the settlement which is not consistent with the
common interest of all." (3) "There can be no leagues or alliances or
special covenants and understandings within the general and common
family of the League of Nations." (4) "There can be no special selfish
economic combinations within the League and no employment of any form of
economic boycott or exclusion, except as the power of economic penalty
by exclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the League
of Nations itself as a means of discipline and control." (5) "All
international agreements and treaties of every kind must be made known
in their entirety to the rest of the world."

This wise and magnanimous program for the world had passed on November
5, 1918 beyond the region of idealism and aspiration, and had become
part of a solemn contract to which all the Great Powers of the world had
put their signature. But it was lost, nevertheless, in the morass of
Paris;--the spirit of it altogether, the letter in parts ignored and in
other parts distorted.

The German observations on the draft Treaty of Peace were largely a
comparison between the terms of this understanding, on the basis of
which the German nation had agreed to lay down its arms, and the actual
provisions of the document offered them for signature thereafter. The
German commentators had little difficulty in showing that the draft
Treaty constituted a breach of engagements and of international morality
comparable with their own offense in the invasion of Belgium.
Nevertheless, the German reply was not in all its parts a document fully
worthy of the occasion, because in spite of the justice and importance
of much of its contents, a truly broad treatment and high dignity of
outlook were a little wanting, and the general effect lacks the simple
treatment, with the dispassionate objectivity of despair which the deep
passions of the occasion might have evoked. The Allied governments gave
it, in any case, no serious consideration, and I doubt if anything which
the German delegation could have said at that stage of the proceedings
would have much influenced the result.

The commonest virtues of the individual are often lacking in the
spokesmen of nations; a statesman representing not himself but his
country may prove, without incurring excessive blame--as history often
records--vindictive, perfidious, and egotistic. These qualities are
familiar in treaties imposed by victors. But the German delegation did
not succeed in exposing in burning and prophetic words the quality which
chiefly distinguishes this transaction from all its historical
predecessors--its insincerity.

This theme, however, must be for another pen than mine. I am mainly
concerned in what follows, not with the justice of the Treaty,--neither
with the demand for penal justice against the enemy, nor with the
obligation of contractual justice on the victor,--but with its wisdom
and with its consequences.

I propose, therefore, in this chapter to set forth baldly the principal
economic provisions of the Treaty, reserving, however, for the next my
comments on the Reparation Chapter and on Germany's capacity to meet the
payments there demanded from her.

The German economic system as it existed before the war depended on
three main factors: I. Overseas commerce as represented by her
mercantile marine, her colonies, her foreign investments, her exports,
and the overseas connections of her merchants; II. The exploitation of
her coal and iron and the industries built upon them; III. Her transport
and tariff system. Of these the first, while not the least important,
was certainly the most vulnerable. The Treaty aims at the systematic
destruction of all three, but principally of the first two.


I

(1) Germany has ceded to the Allies _all_ the vessels of her mercantile
marine exceeding 1600 tons gross, half the vessels between 1000 tons and
1600 tons, and one quarter of her trawlers and other fishing boats.[9]
The cession is comprehensive, including not only vessels flying the
German flag, but also all vessels owned by Germans but flying other
flags, and all vessels under construction as well as those afloat.[10]
Further, Germany undertakes, if required, to build for the Allies such
types of ships as they may specify up to 200,000 tons[11] annually for
five years, the value of these ships being credited to Germany against
what is due from her for Reparation.[12]

Thus the German mercantile marine is swept from the seas and cannot be
restored for many years to come on a scale adequate to meet the
requirements of her own commerce. For the present, no lines will run
from Hamburg, except such as foreign nations may find it worth while to
establish out of their surplus tonnage. Germany will have to pay to
foreigners for the carriage of her trade such charges as they may be
able to exact, and will receive only such conveniences as it may suit
them to give her. The prosperity of German ports and commerce can only
revive, it would seem, in proportion as she succeeds in bringing under
her effective influence the merchant marines of Scandinavia and of
Holland.

(2) Germany has ceded to the Allies "all her rights and titles over her
oversea possessions."[13] This cession not only applies to sovereignty
but extends on unfavorable terms to Government property, all of which,
including railways, must be surrendered without payment, while, on the
other hand, the German Government remains liable for any debt which may
have been incurred for the purchase or construction of this property, or
for the development of the colonies generally.[14]

In distinction from the practice ruling in the case of most similar
cessions in recent history, the property and persons of private German
nationals, as distinct from their Government, are also injuriously
affected. The Allied Government exercising authority in any former
German colony "may make such provisions as it thinks fit with reference
to the repatriation from them of German nationals and to the conditions
upon which German subjects of European origin shall, or shall not, be
allowed to reside, hold property, trade or exercise a profession in
them."[15] All contracts and agreements in favor of German nationals for
the construction or exploitation of public works lapse to the Allied
Governments as part of the payment due for Reparation.

But these terms are unimportant compared with the more comprehensive
provision by which "the Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right
to retain and liquidate _all_ property, rights, and interests belonging
at the date of the coming into force of the present Treaty to German
nationals, or companies controlled by them," within the former German
colonies.[16] This wholesale expropriation of private property is to
take place without the Allies affording any compensation to the
individuals expropriated, and the proceeds will be employed, first, to
meet private debts due to Allied nationals from any German nationals,
and second, to meet claims due from Austrian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, or
Turkish nationals. Any balance may either be returned by the liquidating
Power direct to Germany, or retained by them. If retained, the proceeds
must be transferred to the Reparation Commission for Germany's credit in
the Reparation account.[17]

In short, not only are German sovereignty and German influence
extirpated from the whole of her former oversea possessions, but the
persons and property of her nationals resident or owning property in
those parts are deprived of legal status and legal security.

(3) The provisions just outlined in regard to the private property of
Germans in the ex-German colonies apply equally to private German
property in Alsace-Lorraine, except in so far as the French Government
may choose to grant exceptions.[18] This is of much greater practical
importance than the similar expropriation overseas because of the far
higher value of the property involved and the closer interconnection,
resulting from the great development of the mineral wealth of these
provinces since 1871, of German economic interests there with those in
Germany itself. Alsace-Lorraine has been part of the German Empire for
nearly fifty years--a considerable majority of its population is German
speaking--and it has been the scene of some of Germany's most important
economic enterprises. Nevertheless, the property of those Germans who
reside there, or who have invested in its industries, is now entirely at
the disposal of the French Government without compensation, except in so
far as the German Government itself may choose to afford it. The French
Government is entitled to expropriate without compensation the personal
property of private German citizens and German companies resident or
situated within Alsace-Lorraine, the proceeds being credited in part
satisfaction of various French claims. The severity of this provision is
only mitigated to the extent that the French Government may expressly
permit German nationals to continue to reside, in which case the above
provision is not applicable. Government, State, and Municipal property,
on the other hand, is to be ceded to France without any credit being
given for it. This includes the railway system of the two provinces,
together with its rolling-stock.[19] But while the property is taken
over, liabilities contracted in respect of it in the form of public
debts of any kind remain the liability of Germany.[20] The provinces
also return to French sovereignty free and quit of their share of German
war or pre-war dead-weight debt; nor does Germany receive a credit on
this account in respect of Reparation.

(4) The expropriation of German private property is not limited,
however, to the ex-German colonies and Alsace-Lorraine. The treatment of
such property forms, indeed, a very significant and material section of
the Treaty, which has not received as much attention as it merits,
although it was the subject of exceptionally violent objection on the
part of the German delegates at Versailles. So far as I know, there is
no precedent in any peace treaty of recent history for the treatment of
private property set forth below, and the German representatives urged
that the precedent now established strikes a dangerous and immoral blow
at the security of private property everywhere. This is an exaggeration,
and the sharp distinction, approved by custom and convention during the
past two centuries, between the property and rights of a State and the
property and rights of its nationals is an artificial one, which is
being rapidly put out of date by many other influences than the Peace
Treaty, and is inappropriate to modern socialistic conceptions of the
relations between the State and its citizens. It is true, however, that
the Treaty strikes a destructive blow at a conception which lies at the
root of much of so-called international law, as this has been expounded
hitherto.

The principal provisions relating to the expropriation of German private
property situated outside the frontiers of Germany, as these are now
determined, are overlapping in their incidence, and the more drastic
would seem in some cases to render the others unnecessary. Generally
speaking, however, the more drastic and extensive provisions are not so
precisely framed as those of more particular and limited application.
They are as follows:--

(_a_) The Allies "reserve the right to retain and liquidate all
property, rights and interests belonging at the date of the coming into
force of the present Treaty to German nationals, or companies controlled
by them, within their territories, colonies, possessions and
protectorates, including territories ceded to them by the present
Treaty."[21]

This is the extended version of the provision which has been discussed
already in the case of the colonies and of Alsace-Lorraine. The value of
the property so expropriated will be applied, in the first instance, to
the satisfaction of private debts due from Germany to the nationals of
the Allied Government within whose jurisdiction the liquidation takes
place, and, second, to the satisfaction of claims arising out of the
acts of Germany's former allies. Any balance, if the liquidating
Government elects to retain it, must be credited in the Reparation
account.[22] It is, however, a point of considerable importance that the
liquidating Government is not compelled to transfer the balance to the
Reparation Commission, but can, if it so decides, return the proceeds
direct to Germany. For this will enable the United States, if they so
wish, to utilize the very large balances, in the hands of their
enemy-property custodian, to pay for the provisioning of Germany,
without regard to the views of the Reparation Commission.

These provisions had their origin in the scheme for the mutual
settlement of enemy debts by means of a Clearing House. Under this
proposal it was hoped to avoid much trouble and litigation by making
each of the Governments lately at war responsible for the collection of
private _debts_ due from its nationals to the nationals of any of the
other Governments (the normal process of collection having been
suspended by reason of the war), and for the distribution of the funds
so collected to those of its nationals who had _claims_ against the
nationals of the other Governments, any final balance either way being
settled in cash. Such a scheme could have been completely bilateral and
reciprocal. And so in part it is, the scheme being mainly reciprocal as
regards the collection of commercial debts. But the completeness of
their victory permitted the Allied Governments to introduce in their own
favor many divergencies from reciprocity, of which the following are the
chief: Whereas the property of Allied nationals within German
jurisdiction reverts under the Treaty to Allied ownership on the
conclusion of Peace, the property of Germans within Allied jurisdiction
is to be retained and liquidated as described above, with the result
that the whole of German property over a large part of the world can be
expropriated, and the large properties now within the custody of Public
Trustees and similar officials in the Allied countries may be retained
permanently. In the second place, such German assets are chargeable, not
only with the liabilities of Germans, but also, if they run to it, with
"payment of the amounts due in respect of claims by the nationals of
such Allied or Associated Power with regard to their property, rights,
and interests in the territory of other Enemy Powers," as, for example,
Turkey, Bulgaria, and Austria.[23] This is a remarkable provision,
which is naturally non-reciprocal. In the third place, any final balance
due to Germany on private account need not be paid over, but can be held
against the various liabilities of the German Government.[24] The
effective operation of these Articles is guaranteed by the delivery of
deeds, titles, and information.[25] In the fourth place, pre-war
contracts between Allied and German nationals may be canceled or revived
at the option of the former, so that all such contracts which are in
Germany's favor will be canceled, while, on the other hand, she will be
compelled to fulfil those which are to her disadvantage.

(_b_) So far we have been concerned with German property within Allied
jurisdiction. The next provision is aimed at the elimination of German
interests in the territory of her neighbors and former allies, and of
certain other countries. Under Article 260 of the Financial Clauses it
is provided that the Reparation Commission may, within one year of the
coming into force of the Treaty, demand that the German Government
expropriate its nationals and deliver to the Reparation Commission "any
rights and interests of German nationals in any public utility
undertaking or in any concession[26] operating in Russia, China, Turkey,
Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, or in the possessions or dependencies of
these States, or in any territory formerly belonging to Germany or her
allies, to be ceded by Germany or her allies to any Power or to be
administered by a Mandatory under the present Treaty." This is a
comprehensive description, overlapping in part the provisions dealt with
under (_a_) above, but including, it should be noted, the new States and
territories carved out of the former Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and
Turkish Empires. Thus Germany's influence is eliminated and her capital
confiscated in all those neighboring countries to which she might
naturally look for her future livelihood, and for an outlet for her
energy, enterprise, and technical skill.

The execution of this program in detail will throw on the Reparation
Commission a peculiar task, as it will become possessor of a great
number of rights and interests over a vast territory owing dubious
obedience, disordered by war, disruption, and Bolshevism. The division
of the spoils between the victors will also provide employment for a
powerful office, whose doorsteps the greedy adventurers and jealous
concession-hunters of twenty or thirty nations will crowd and defile.

Lest the Reparation Commission fail by ignorance to exercise its rights
to the full, it is further provided that the German Government shall
communicate to it within six months of the Treaty's coming into force a
list of all the rights and interests in question, "whether already
granted, contingent or not yet exercised," and any which are not so
communicated within this period will automatically lapse in favor of the
Allied Governments.[27] How far an edict of this character can be made
binding on a German national, whose person and property lie outside the
jurisdiction of his own Government, is an unsettled question; but all
the countries specified in the above list are open to pressure by the
Allied authorities, whether by the imposition of an appropriate Treaty
clause or otherwise.

(_c_) There remains a third provision more sweeping than either of the
above, neither of which affects German interests in _neutral_
countries. The Reparation Commission is empowered up to May 1, 1921, to
demand payment up to $5,000,000,000 _in such manner as they may fix_,
"whether in gold, commodities, ships, securities or otherwise."[28] This
provision has the effect of intrusting to the Reparation Commission for
the period in question dictatorial powers over all German property of
every description whatever. They can, under this Article, point to any
specific business, enterprise, or property, whether within or outside
Germany, and demand its surrender; and their authority would appear to
extend not only to property existing at the date of the Peace, but also
to any which may be created or acquired at any time in the course of the
next eighteen months. For example, they could pick out--as presumably
they will as soon as they are established--the fine and powerful German
enterprise in South America known as the _Deutsche Ueberseeische
Elektrizit‰tsgesellschaft_ (the D.U.E.G.), and dispose of it to Allied
interests. The clause is unequivocal and all-embracing. It is worth
while to note in passing that it introduces a quite novel principle in
the collection of indemnities. Hitherto, a sum has been fixed, and the
nation mulcted has been left free to devise and select for itself the
means of payment. But in this case the payees can (for a certain
period) not only demand a certain sum but specify the particular kind of
property in which payment is to be effected. Thus the powers of the
Reparation Commission, with which I deal more particularly in the next
chapter, can be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic
organization as well as to exact payment.

The cumulative effect of (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) (as well as of certain
other minor provisions on which I have not thought it necessary to
enlarge) is to deprive Germany (or rather to empower the Allies so to
deprive her at their will--it is not yet accomplished) of everything she
possesses outside her own frontiers as laid down in the Treaty. Not only
are her oversea investments taken and her connections destroyed, but the
same process of extirpation is applied in the territories of her former
allies and of her immediate neighbors by land.

(5) Lest by some oversight the above provisions should overlook any
possible contingencies, certain other Articles appear in the Treaty,
which probably do not add very much in practical effect to those already
described, but which deserve brief mention as showing the spirit of
completeness in which the victorious Powers entered upon the economic
subjection of their defeated enemy.

First of all there is a general clause of barrer and renunciation: "In
territory outside her European frontiers as fixed by the present Treaty,
Germany renounces all rights, titles and privileges whatever in or over
territory which belonged to her or to her allies, and all rights, titles
and privileges whatever their origin which she held as against the
Allied and Associated Powers...."[29]

There follow certain more particular provisions. Germany renounces all
rights and privileges she may have acquired in China.[30] There are
similar provisions for Siam,[31] for Liberia,[32] for Morocco,[33] and
for Egypt.[34] In the case of Egypt not only are special privileges
renounced, but by Article 150 ordinary liberties are withdrawn, the
Egyptian Government being accorded "complete liberty of action in
regulating the status of German nationals and the conditions under which
they may establish themselves in Egypt."

By Article 258 Germany renounces her right to any participation in any
financial or economic organizations of an international character
"operating in any of the Allied or Associated States, or in Austria,
Hungary, Bulgaria or Turkey, or in the dependencies of these States, or
in the former Russian Empire."

Generally speaking, only those pre-war treaties and conventions are
revived which it suits the Allied Governments to revive, and those in
Germany's favor may be allowed to lapse.[35]

It is evident, however, that none of these provisions are of any real
importance, as compared with those described previously. They represent
the logical completion of Germany's outlawry and economic subjection to
the convenience of the Allies; but they do not add substantially to her
effective disabilities.


II

The provisions relating to coal and iron are more important in respect
of their ultimate consequences on Germany's internal industrial economy
than for the money value immediately involved. The German Empire has
been built more truly on coal and iron than on blood and iron. The
skilled exploitation of the great coalfields of the Ruhr, Upper Silesia,
and the Saar, alone made possible the development of the steel,
chemical, and electrical industries which established her as the first
industrial nation of continental Europe. One-third of Germany's
population lives in towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants, an industrial
concentration which is only possible on a foundation of coal and iron.
In striking, therefore, at her coal supply, the French politicians were
not mistaking their target. It is only the extreme immoderation, and
indeed technical impossibility, of the Treaty's demands which may save
the situation in the long-run.

(1) The Treaty strikes at Germany's coal supply in four ways:--

(i.) "As compensation for the destruction of the coal-mines in the north
of France, and as part payment towards the total reparation due from
Germany for the damage resulting from the war, Germany cedes to France
in full and absolute possession, with exclusive rights of exploitation,
unencumbered, and free from all debts and charges of any kind, the
coal-mines situated in the Saar Basin."[36] While the administration of
this district is vested for fifteen years in the League of Nations, it
is to be observed that the mines are ceded to France absolutely. Fifteen
years hence the population of the district will be called upon to
indicate by plebiscite their desires as to the future sovereignty of the
territory; and, in the event of their electing for union with Germany,
Germany is to be entitled to repurchase the mines at a price payable in
gold.[37]

The judgment of the world has already recognized the transaction of the
Saar as an act of spoliation and insincerity. So far as compensation for
the destruction of French coal-mines is concerned, this is provided for,
as we shall see in a moment, elsewhere in the Treaty. "There is no
industrial region in Germany," the German representatives have said
without contradiction, "the population of which is so permanent, so
homogeneous, and so little complex as that of the Saar district. Among
more than 650,000 inhabitants, there were in 1918 less than 100 French.
The Saar district has been German for more than 1,000 years. Temporary
occupation as a result of warlike operations on the part of the French
always terminated in a short time in the restoration of the country upon
the conclusion of peace. During a period of 1048 years France has
possessed the country for not quite 68 years in all. When, on the
occasion of the first Treaty of Paris in 1814, a small portion of the
territory now coveted was retained for France, the population raised the
most energetic opposition and demanded 'reunion with their German
fatherland,' to which they were 'related by language, customs, and
religion.' After an occupation of one year and a quarter, this desire
was taken into account in the second Treaty of Paris in 1815. Since then
the country has remained uninterruptedly attached to Germany, and owes
its economic development to that connection."

The French wanted the coal for the purpose of working the ironfields of
Lorraine, and in the spirit of Bismarck they have taken it. Not
precedent, but the verbal professions of the Allies, have rendered it
indefensible.[38]

(ii.) Upper Silesia, a district without large towns, in which, however,
lies one of the major coalfields of Germany with a production of about
23 per cent of the total German output of hard coal, is, subject to a
plebiscite,[39] to be ceded to Poland. Upper Silesia was never part of
historic Poland; but its population is mixed Polish, German, and
Czecho-Slovakian, the precise proportions of which are disputed.[40]
Economically it is intensely German; the industries of Eastern Germany
depend upon it for their coal; and its loss would be a destructive blow
at the economic structure of the German State.[41]

With the loss of the fields of Upper Silesia and the Saar, the coal
supplies of Germany are diminished by not far short of one-third.

(iii.) Out of the coal that remains to her, Germany is obliged to make
good year by year the estimated loss which France has incurred by the
destruction and damage of war in the coalfields of her northern
Provinces. In para. 2 of Annex V. to the Reparation Chapter, "Germany
undertakes to deliver to France annually, for a period not exceeding ten
years, an amount of coal equal to the difference between the annual
production before the war of the coal-mines of the Nord and Pas de
Calais, destroyed as a result of the war, and the production of the
mines of the same area during the year in question: such delivery not to
exceed 20,000,000 tons in any one year of the first five years, and
8,000,000 tons in any one year of the succeeding five years."

This is a reasonable provision if it stood by itself, and one which
Germany should be able to fulfil if she were left her other resources to
do it with.

(iv.) The final provision relating to coal is part of the general scheme
of the Reparation Chapter by which the sums due for Reparation are to be
partly paid in kind instead of in cash. As a part of the payment due for
Reparation, Germany is to make the following deliveries of coal or
equivalent in coke (the deliveries to France being wholly additional to
the amounts available by the cession of the Saar or in compensation for
destruction in Northern France):--

(i.) To France 7,000,000 tons annually for ten years;[42]

(ii.) To Belgium 8,000,000 tons annually for ten years;

(iii.) To Italy an annual quantity, rising by annual increments from
4,500,000 tons in 1919-1920 to 8,500,000 tons in each of the six years,
1923-1924 to 1928-1929;

(iv.) To Luxemburg, if required, a quantity of coal equal to the
pre-war annual consumption of German coal in Luxemburg.

This amounts in all to an annual average of about 25,000,000 tons.

       *       *       *       *       *

These figures have to be examined in relation to Germany's probable
output. The maximum pre-war figure was reached in 1913 with a total of
191,500,000 tons. Of this, 19,000,000 tons were consumed at the mines,
and on balance (_i.e._ exports less imports) 33,500,000 tons were
exported, leaving 139,000,000 tons for domestic consumption. It is
estimated that this total was employed as follows:--

    Railways                      18,000,000 tons.
    Gas, water, and electricity   12,500,000  "
    Bunkers                        6,500,000  "
    House-fuel, small industry
      and agriculture             24,000,000  "
    Industry                      78,000,000  "
                                 -----------
                                 139,000,000  "

The diminution of production due to loss of territory is:--

    Alsace-Lorraine                3,800,000 tons.
    Saar Basin                    13,200,000  "
    Upper Silesia                 43,800,000  "
                                 -----------
                                  60,800,000  "

There would remain, therefore, on the basis of the 1913 output,
130,700,000 tons, or, deducting consumption at the mines themselves,
(say) 118,000,000 tons. For some years there must be sent out of this
supply upwards of 20,000,000 tons to France as compensation for damage
done to French mines, and 25,000,000 tons to France, Belgium, Italy, and
Luxemburg;[43] as the former figure is a maximum, and the latter figure
is to be slightly less in the earliest years, we may take the total
export to Allied countries which Germany has undertaken to provide as
40,000,000 tons, leaving, on the above basis, 78,000,000 tons for her
own use as against a pre-war consumption of 139,000,000 tons.

This comparison, however, requires substantial modification to make it
accurate. On the one hand, it is certain that the figures of pre-war
output cannot be relied on as a basis of present output. During 1918 the
production was 161,500,000 tons as compared with 191,500,000 tons in
1913; and during the first half of 1919 it was less than 50,000,000
tons, exclusive of Alsace-Lorraine and the Saar but including Upper
Silesia, corresponding to an annual production of about 100,000,000
tons.[44] The causes of so low an output were in part temporary and
exceptional but the German authorities agree, and have not been
confuted, that some of them are bound to persist for some time to come.
In part they are the same as elsewhere; the daily shift has been
shortened from 8-1/2 to 7 hours, and it is improbable that the powers of
the Central Government will be adequate to restore them to their former
figure. But in addition, the mining plant is in bad condition (due to
the lack of certain essential materials during the blockade), the
physical efficiency of the men is greatly impaired by malnutrition
(which cannot be cured if a tithe of the reparation demands are to be
satisfied,--the standard of life will have rather to be lowered), and
the casualties of the war have diminished the numbers of efficient
miners. The analogy of English conditions is sufficient by itself to
tell us that a pre-war level of output cannot be expected in Germany.
German authorities put the loss of output at somewhat above 30 per
cent, divided about equally between the shortening of the shift and the
other economic influences. This figure appears on general grounds to be
plausible, but I have not the knowledge to endorse or to criticize it.

The pre-war figure of 118,000,000 tons net (_i.e._ after allowing for
loss of territory and consumption at the mines) is likely to fall,
therefore, at least as low as to 100,000,000[45] tons, having regard to
the above factors. If 40,000,000 tons of this are to be exported to the
Allies, there remain 60,000,000 tons for Germany herself to meet her own
domestic consumption. Demand as well as supply will be diminished by
loss of territory, but at the most extravagant estimate this could not
be put above 29,000,000 tons.[46] Our hypothetical calculations,
therefore, leave us with post-war German domestic requirements, on the
basis of a pre-war efficiency of railways and industry, of 110,000,000
tons against an output not exceeding 100,000,000 tons, of which
40,000,000 tons are mortgaged to the Allies.

The importance of the subject has led me into a somewhat lengthy
statistical analysis. It is evident that too much significance must not
be attached to the precise figures arrived at, which are hypothetical
and dubious.[47] But the general character of the facts presents itself
irresistibly. Allowing for the loss of territory and the loss of
efficiency, Germany cannot export coal in the near future (and will even
be dependent on her Treaty rights to purchase in Upper Silesia), if she
is to continue as an industrial nation. Every million tons she is forced
to export must be at the expense of closing down an industry. With
results to be considered later this within certain limits is _possible_.
But it is evident that Germany cannot and will not furnish the Allies
with a contribution of 40,000,000 tons annually. Those Allied Ministers,
who have told their peoples that she can, have certainly deceived them
for the sake of allaying for the moment the misgivings of the European
peoples as to the path along which they are being led.

The presence of these illusory provisions (amongst others) in the
clauses of the Treaty of Peace is especially charged with danger for
the future. The more extravagant expectations as to Reparation
receipts, by which Finance Ministers have deceived their publics, will
be heard of no more when they have served their immediate purpose of
postponing the hour of taxation and retrenchment. But the coal clauses
will not be lost sight of so easily,--for the reason that it will be
absolutely vital in the interests of France and Italy that these
countries should do everything in their power to exact their bond. As a
result of the diminished output due to German destruction in France, of
the diminished output of mines in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and
of many secondary causes, such as the breakdown of transport and of
organization and the inefficiency of new governments, the coal position
of all Europe is nearly desperate;[48] and France and Italy, entering
the scramble with certain Treaty rights, will not lightly surrender
them.

As is generally the case in real dilemmas, the French and Italian case
will possess great force, indeed unanswerable force from a certain point
of view. The position will be truly represented as a question between
German industry on the one hand and French and Italian industry on the
other. It may be admitted that the surrender of the coal will destroy
German industry, but it may be equally true that its non-surrender will
jeopardize French and Italian industry. In such a case must not the
victors with their Treaty rights prevail, especially when much of the
damage has been ultimately due to the wicked acts of those who are now
defeated? Yet if these feelings and these rights are allowed to prevail
beyond what wisdom would recommend, the reactions on the social and
economic life of Central Europe will be far too strong to be confined
within their original limits.

But this is not yet the whole problem. If France and Italy are to make
good their own deficiencies in coal from the output of Germany, then
Northern Europe, Switzerland, and Austria, which previously drew their
coal in large part from Germany's exportable surplus, must be starved of
their supplies. Before the war 13,600,000 tons of Germany's coal exports
went to Austria-Hungary. Inasmuch as nearly all the coalfields of the
former Empire lie outside what is now German-Austria, the industrial
ruin of this latter state, if she cannot obtain coal from Germany, will
be complete. The case of Germany's neutral neighbors, who were formerly
supplied in part from Great Britain but in large part from Germany,
will be hardly less serious. They will go to great lengths in the
direction of making their own supplies to Germany of materials which are
essential to her, conditional on these being paid for in coal. Indeed
they are already doing so.[49] With the breakdown of money economy the
practice of international barter is becoming prevalent. Nowadays money
in Central and South-Eastern Europe is seldom a true measure of value in
exchange, and will not necessarily buy anything, with the consequence
that one country, possessing a commodity essential to the needs of
another, sells it not for cash but only against a reciprocal engagement
on the part of the latter country to furnish in return some article not
less necessary to the former. This is an extraordinary complication as
compared with the former almost perfect simplicity of international
trade. But in the no less extraordinary conditions of to-day's industry
it is not without advantages as a means of stimulating production. The
butter-shifts of the Ruhr[50] show how far modern Europe has
retrograded in the direction of barter, and afford a picturesque
illustration of the low economic organization to which the breakdown of
currency and free exchange between individuals and nations is quickly
leading us. But they may produce the coal where other devices would
fail.[51]

Yet if Germany can find coal for the neighboring neutrals, France and
Italy may loudly claim that in this case she can and must keep her
treaty obligations. In this there will be a great show of justice, and
it will be difficult to weigh against such claims the possible facts
that, while German miners will work for butter, there is no available
means of compelling them to get coal, the sale of which will bring in
nothing, and that if Germany has no coal to send to her neighbors she
may fail to secure imports essential to her economic existence.

If the distribution of the European coal supplies is to be a scramble in
which France is satisfied first, Italy next, and every one else takes
their chance, the industrial future of Europe is black and the prospects
of revolution very good. It is a case where particular interests and
particular claims, however well founded in sentiment or in justice,
must yield to sovereign expediency. If there is any approximate truth in
Mr. Hoover's calculation that the coal output of Europe has fallen by
one-third, a situation confronts us where distribution must be effected
with even-handed impartiality in accordance with need, and no incentive
can be neglected towards increased production and economical methods of
transport. The establishment by the Supreme Council of the Allies in
August, 1919, of a European Coal Commission, consisting of delegates
from Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Poland, and Czecho-Slovakia
was a wise measure which, properly employed and extended, may prove of
great assistance. But I reserve constructive proposals for Chapter VII.
Here I am only concerned with tracing the consequences, _per
impossibile_, of carrying out the Treaty _au pied de lettre_.[52]

(2) The provisions relating to iron-ore require less detailed attention,
though their effects are destructive. They require less attention,
because they are in large measure inevitable. Almost exactly 75 per cent
of the iron-ore raised in Germany in 1913 came from Alsace-Lorraine.[53]
In this the chief importance of the stolen provinces lay.

There is no question but that Germany must lose these ore-fields. The
only question is how far she is to be allowed facilities for purchasing
their produce. The German Delegation made strong efforts to secure the
inclusion of a provision by which coal and coke to be furnished by them
to France should be given in exchange for _minette_ from Lorraine. But
they secured no such stipulation, and the matter remains at France's
option.

The motives which will govern France's eventual policy are not entirely
concordant. While Lorraine comprised 75 per cent of Germany's iron-ore,
only 25 per cent of the blast furnaces lay within Lorraine and the Saar
basin together, a large proportion of the ore being carried into Germany
proper. Approximately the same proportion of Germany's iron and steel
foundries, namely 25 per cent, were situated in Alsace-Lorraine. For
the moment, therefore, the most economical and profitable course would
certainly be to export to Germany, as hitherto, a considerable part of
the output of the mines.

On the other hand, France, having recovered the deposits of Lorraine,
may be expected to aim at replacing as far as possible the industries,
which Germany had based on them, by industries situated within her own
frontiers. Much time must elapse before the plant and the skilled labor
could be developed within France, and even so she could hardly deal with
the ore unless she could rely on receiving the coal from Germany. The
uncertainty, too, as to the ultimate fate of the Saar will be disturbing
to the calculations of capitalists who contemplate the establishment of
new industries in France.

In fact, here, as elsewhere, political considerations cut disastrously
across economic. In a rÈgime of Free Trade and free economic intercourse
it would be of little consequence that iron lay on one side of a
political frontier, and labor, coal, and blast furnaces on the other.
But as it is, men have devised ways to impoverish themselves and one
another; and prefer collective animosities to individual happiness. It
seems certain, calculating on the present passions and impulses of
European capitalistic society, that the effective iron output of Europe
will be diminished by a new political frontier (which sentiment and
historic justice require), because nationalism and private interest are
thus allowed to impose a new economic frontier along the same lines.
These latter considerations are allowed, in the present governance of
Europe, to prevail over the intense need of the Continent for the most
sustained and efficient production to repair the destructions of war,
and to satisfy the insistence of labor for a larger reward.[54]

The same influences are likely to be seen, though on a lesser scale, in
the event of the transference of Upper Silesia to Poland. While Upper
Silesia contains but little iron, the presence of coal has led to the
establishment of numerous blast furnaces. What is to be the fate of
these? If Germany is cut off from her supplies of ore on the west, will
she export beyond her frontiers on the east any part of the little which
remains to her? The efficiency and output of the industry seem certain
to diminish.

Thus the Treaty strikes at organization, and by the destruction of
organization impairs yet further the reduced wealth of the whole
community. The economic frontiers which are to be established between
the coal and the iron, upon which modern industrialism is founded, will
not only diminish the production of useful commodities, but may possibly
occupy an immense quantity of human labor in dragging iron or coal, as
the case may be, over many useless miles to satisfy the dictates of a
political treaty or because obstructions have been established to the
proper localization of industry.


III

There remain those Treaty provisions which relate to the transport and
the tariff systems of Germany. These parts of the Treaty have not nearly
the importance and the significance of those discussed hitherto. They
are pin-pricks, interferences and vexations, not so much objectionable
for their solid consequences, as dishonorable to the Allies in the light
of their professions. Let the reader consider what follows in the light
of the assurances already quoted, in reliance on which Germany laid down
her arms.

(i.) The miscellaneous Economic Clauses commence with a number of
provisions which would be in accordance with the spirit of the third of
the Fourteen Points,--if they were reciprocal. Both for imports and
exports, and as regards tariffs, regulations, and prohibitions, Germany
binds herself for five years to accord most-favored-nation treatment to
the Allied and Associated States.[55] But she is not entitled herself to
receive such treatment.

For five years Alsace-Lorraine shall be free to export into Germany,
without payment of customs duty, up to the average amount sent annually
into Germany from 1911 to 1913.[56] But there is no similar provision
for German exports into Alsace-Lorraine.

For three years Polish exports to Germany, and for five years
Luxemburg's exports to Germany, are to have a similar privilege,[57]--
but not German exports to Poland or to Luxemburg. Luxemburg also, which
for many years has enjoyed the benefits of inclusion within the German
Customs Union, is permanently excluded from it henceforward.[58]

For six months after the Treaty has come into force Germany may not
impose duties on imports from the Allied and Associated States higher
than the most favorable duties prevalent before the war and for a
further two years and a half (making three years in all) this
prohibition continues to apply to certain commodities, notably to some
of those as to which special agreements existed before the war, and also
to wine, to vegetable oils, to artificial silk, and to washed or scoured
wool.[59] This is a ridiculous and injurious provision, by which Germany
is prevented from taking those steps necessary to conserve her limited
resources for the purchase of necessaries and the discharge of
Reparation. As a result of the existing distribution of wealth in
Germany, and of financial wantonness amongst individuals, the offspring
of uncertainty, Germany is threatened with a deluge of luxuries and
semi-luxuries from abroad, of which she has been starved for years,
which would exhaust or diminish her small supplies of foreign exchange.
These provisions strike at the authority of the German Government to
ensure economy in such consumption, or to raise taxation during a
critical period. What an example of senseless greed overreaching itself,
to introduce, after taking from Germany what liquid wealth she has and
demanding impossible payments for the future, a special and
particularized injunction that she must allow as readily as in the days
of her prosperity the import of champagne and of silk!

One other Article affects the Customs RÈgime of Germany which, if it was
applied, would be serious and extensive in its consequences. The Allies
have reserved the right to apply a special customs rÈgime to the
occupied area on the bank of the Rhine, "in the event of such a measure
being necessary in their opinion in order to safeguard the economic
interests of the population of these territories."[60] This provision
was probably introduced as a possibly useful adjunct to the French
policy of somehow detaching the left bank provinces from Germany during
the years of their occupation. The project of establishing an
independent Republic under French clerical auspices, which would act as
a buffer state and realize the French ambition of driving Germany proper
beyond the Rhine, has not yet been abandoned. Some believe that much may
be accomplished by a rÈgime of threats, bribes, and cajolery extended
over a period of fifteen years or longer.[61] If this Article is acted
upon, and the economic system of the left bank of the Rhine is
effectively severed from the rest of Germany, the effect would be
far-reaching. But the dreams of designing diplomats do not always
prosper, and we must trust the future.

(ii.) The clauses relating to Railways, as originally presented to
Germany, were substantially modified in the final Treaty, and are now
limited to a provision by which goods, coming from Allied territory to
Germany, or in transit through Germany, shall receive the most favored
treatment as regards rail freight rates, etc., applied to goods of the
same kind carried on _any_ German lines "under similar conditions of
transport, for example, as regards length of route."[62] As a
non-reciprocal provision this is an act of interference in internal
arrangements which it is difficult to justify, but the practical effect
of this,[63] and of an analogous provision relating to passenger
traffic,[64] will much depend on the interpretation of the phrase,
"similar conditions of transport."[65]

For the time being Germany's transport system will be much more
seriously disordered by the provisions relating to the cession of
rolling-stock. Under paragraph 7 of the Armistice conditions Germany was
called on to surrender 5000 locomotives and 150,000 wagons, "in good
working order, with all necessary spare parts and fittings." Under the
Treaty Germany is required to confirm this surrender and to recognize
the title of the Allies to the material.[66] She is further required, in
the case of railway systems in ceded territory, to hand over these
systems complete with their full complement of rolling-stock "in a
normal state of upkeep" as shown in the last inventory before November
11, 1918.[67] That is to say, ceded railway systems are not to bear any
share in the general depletion and deterioration of the German
rolling-stock as a whole.

This is a loss which in course of time can doubtless be made good. But
lack of lubricating oils and the prodigious wear and tear of the war,
not compensated by normal repairs, had already reduced the German
railway system to a low state of efficiency. The further heavy losses
under the Treaty will confirm this state of affairs for some time to
come, and are a substantial aggravation of the difficulties of the coal
problem and of export industry generally.

(iii.) There remain the clauses relating to the river system of Germany.
These are largely unnecessary and are so little related to the supposed
aims of the Allies that their purport is generally unknown. Yet they
constitute an unprecedented interference with a country's domestic
arrangements and are capable of being so operated as to take from
Germany all effective control over her own transport system. In their
present form they are incapable of justification; but some simple
changes might transform them into a reasonable instrument.

Most of the principal rivers of Germany have their source or their
outlet in non-German territory. The Rhine, rising in Switzerland, is now
a frontier river for a part of its course, and finds the sea in Holland;
the Danube rises in Germany but flows over its greater length elsewhere;
the Elbe rises in the mountains of Bohemia, now called Czecho-Slovakia;
the Oder traverses Lower Silesia; and the Niemen now bounds the frontier
of East Prussia and has its source in Russia. Of these, the Rhine and
the Niemen are frontier rivers, the Elbe is primarily German but in its
upper reaches has much importance for Bohemia, the Danube in its German
parts appears to have little concern for any country but Germany, and
the Oder is an almost purely German river unless the result of the
plebiscite is to detach all Upper Silesia.

Rivers which, in the words of the Treaty, "naturally provide more than
one State with access to the sea," properly require some measure of
international regulation and adequate guarantees against discrimination.
This principle has long been recognized in the International Commissions
which regulate the Rhine and the Danube. But on such Commissions the
States concerned should be represented more or less in proportion to
their interests. The Treaty, however, has made the international
character of these rivers a pretext for taking the river system of
Germany out of German control.

After certain Articles which provide suitably against discrimination and
interference with freedom of transit,[68] the Treaty proceeds to hand
over the administration of the Elbe, the Oder, the Danube, and the Rhine
to International Commissions.[69] The ultimate powers of these
Commissions are to be determined by "a General Convention drawn up by
the Allied and Associated Powers, and approved by the League of
Nations."[70] In the meantime the Commissions are to draw up their own
constitutions and are apparently to enjoy powers of the most extensive
description, "particularly in regard to the execution of works of
maintenance, control, and improvement on the river system, the financial
rÈgime, the fixing and collection of charges, and regulations for
navigation."[71]

So far there is much to be said for the Treaty. Freedom of through
transit is a not unimportant part of good international practice and
should be established everywhere. The objectionable feature of the
Commissions lies in their membership. In each case the voting is so
weighted as to place Germany in a clear minority. On the Elbe Commission
Germany has four votes out of ten; on the Oder Commission three out of
nine; on the Rhine Commission four out of nineteen; on the Danube
Commission, which is not yet definitely constituted, she will be
apparently in a small minority. On the government of all these rivers
France and Great Britain are represented; and on the Elbe for some
undiscoverable reason there are also representatives of Italy and
Belgium.

Thus the great waterways of Germany are handed over to foreign bodies
with the widest powers; and much of the local and domestic business of
Hamburg, Magdeburg, Dresden, Stettin, Frankfurt, Breslan, and Ulm will
be subject to a foreign jurisdiction. It is almost as though the Powers
of Continental Europe were to be placed in a majority on the Thames
Conservancy or the Port of London.

Certain minor provisions follow lines which in our survey of the Treaty
are now familiar. Under Annex III. of the Reparation Chapter Germany is
to cede up to 20 per cent of her inland navigation tonnage. Over and
above this she must cede such proportion of her river craft upon the
Elbe, the Oder, the Niemen, and the Danube as an American arbitrator may
determine, "due regard being had to the legitimate needs of the parties
concerned, and particularly to the shipping traffic during the five
years preceding the war," the craft so ceded to be selected from those
most recently built.[72] The same course is to be followed with German
vessels and tugs on the Rhine and with German property in the port of
Rotterdam.[73] Where the Rhine flows between France and Germany, France
is to have all the rights of utilizing the water for irrigation or for
power and Germany is to have none;[74] and all the bridges are to be
French property as to their whole length.[75] Finally the administration
of the purely German Rhine port of Kehl lying on the eastern bank of the
river is to be united to that of Strassburg for seven years and managed
by a Frenchman to be nominated by the new Rhine Commission.

Thus the Economic Clauses of the Treaty are comprehensive, and little
has been overlooked which might impoverish Germany now or obstruct her
development in future. So situated, Germany is to make payments of
money, on a scale and in a manner to be examined in the next chapter.

[38] "We take over the ownership of the Sarre mines, and in
order not to be inconvenienced in the exploitation of these coal
deposits, we constitute a distinct little estate for the 600,000 Germans
who inhabit this coal basin, and in fifteen years we shall endeavor by a
plebiscite to bring them to declare that they want to be French. We know
what that means. During fifteen years we are going to work on them, to
attack them from every point, till we obtain from them a declaration of
love. It is evidently a less brutal proceeding than the _coup de force_
which detached from us our Alsatians and Lorrainers. But if less brutal,
it is more hypocritical. We know quite well between ourselves that it is
an attempt to annex these 600,000 Germans. One can understand very well
the reasons of an economic nature which have led Clemenceau to wish to
give us these Sarre coal deposits, but in order to acquire them must we
give ourselves the appearance of wanting to juggle with 600,000 Germans
in order to make Frenchmen of them in fifteen years?" (M. HervÈ in _La
Victorie_, May 31, 1919).

[39] This plebiscite is the most important of the concessions
accorded to Germany in the Allies' Final Note, and one for which Mr.
Lloyd George, who never approved the Allies' policy on the Eastern
frontiers of Germany, can claim the chief credit. The vote cannot take
place before the spring of 1920, and may be postponed until 1921. In the
meantime the province will be governed by an Allied Commission. The vote
will be taken by communes, and the final frontiers will be determined by
the Allies, who shall have regard, partly to the results of the vote in
each commune, and partly "to the geographical and economic conditions of
the locality." It would require great local knowledge to predict the
result. By voting Polish, a locality can escape liability for the
indemnity, and for the crushing taxation consequent on voting German, a
factor not to be neglected. On the other hand, the bankruptcy and
incompetence of the new Polish State might deter those who were disposed
to vote on economic rather than on racial grounds. It has also been
stated that the conditions of life in such matters as sanitation and
social legislation are incomparably better in Upper Silesia than in the
adjacent districts of Poland, where similar legislation is in its
infancy. The argument in the text assumes that Upper Silesia will cease
to be German. But much may happen in a year, and the assumption is not
certain. To the extent that it proves erroneous the conclusions must be
modified.

[40] German authorities claim, not without contradiction, that
to judge from the votes cast at elections, one-third of the population
would elect in the Polish interest, and two-thirds in the German.

[41] It must not be overlooked, however, that, amongst the
other concessions relating to Silesia accorded in the Allies' Final
Note, there has been included Article 90, by which "Poland undertakes to
permit for a period of fifteen years the exportation to Germany of the
products of the mines in any part of Upper Silesia transferred to Poland
in accordance with the present Treaty. Such products shall be free from
all export duties or other charges or restrictions on exportation.
Poland agrees to take such steps as may be necessary to secure that any
such products shall be available for sale to purchasers in Germany on
terms as favorable as are applicable to like products sold under similar
conditions to purchasers in Poland or in any other country." This does
not apparently amount to a right of preemption, and it is not easy to
estimate its effective practical consequences. It is evident, however,
that in so far as the mines are maintained at their former efficiency,
and in so far as Germany is in a position to purchase substantially her
former supplies from that source, the loss is limited to the effect on
her balance of trade, and is without the more serious repercussions on
her economic life which are contemplated in the text. Here is an
opportunity for the Allies to render more tolerable the actual operation
of the settlement. The Germans, it should be added, have pointed out
that the same economic argument which adds the Saar fields to France
allots Upper Silesia to Germany. For whereas the Silesian mines are
essential to the economic life of Germany, Poland does not need them. Of
Poland's pre-war annual demand of 10,500,000 tons, 6,800,000 tons were
supplied by the indisputably Polish districts adjacent to Upper Silesia.
1,500,000 tons from Upper Silesia (out of a total Upper Silesian output
of 43,500,000 tons), and the balance from what is now Czecho-Slovakia.
Even without any supply from Upper Silesia and Czecho-Slovakia, Poland
could probably meet her requirements by the fuller exploitation of her
own coalfields which are not yet scientifically developed, or from the
deposits of Western Galicia which are now to be annexed to her.

[42] France is also to receive annually for three years 35,000
tons of benzol, 60,000 tons of coal tar, and 30,000 tons of sulphate of
ammonia.

[43] The Reparation Commission is authorized under the Treaty
(Part VIII Annex V. para. 10) "to postpone or to cancel deliveries" if
they consider "that the full exercise of the foregoing options would
interfere unduly with the industrial requirements of Germany." In the
event of such postponements or cancellations "the coal to replace coal
from destroyed mines shall receive priority over other deliveries." This
concluding clause is of the greatest importance, if, as will be seen, it
is physically impossible for Germany to furnish the full 45,000,000; for
it means that France will receive 20,000,000 tons before Italy receives
anything. The Reparation Commission has no discretion to modify this.
The Italian Press has not failed to notice the significance of the
provision, and alleges that this clause was inserted during the absence
of the Italian representatives from Paris (_Corriere della Sera_, July
19, 1919).

[44] It follows that the current rate of production in Germany
has sunk to about 60 per cent of that of 1913. The effect on reserves
has naturally been disastrous, and the prospects for the coming winter
are dangerous.

[45] This assumes a loss of output of 15 per cent as compared
with the estimate of 30 per cent quoted above.

[46] This supposes a loss of 23 per cent of Germany's
industrial undertaking and a diminution of 13 per cent in her other
requirements.

[47] The reader must be reminded in particular that the above
calculations take no account of the German production of lignite, which
yielded in 1913 13,000,000 tons of rough lignite in addition to an
amount converted into 21,000,000 tons of briquette. This amount of
lignite, however, was required in Germany before the war _in addition
to_ the quantities of coal assumed above. I am not competent to speak on
the extent to which the loss of coal can be made good by the extended
use of lignite or by economies in its present employment; but some
authorities believe that Germany may obtain substantial compensation for
her loss of coal by paying more attention to her deposits of lignite.

[48] Mr. Hoover, in July, 1919, estimated that the coal output
of Europe, excluding Russia and the Balkans, had dropped from
679,500,000 tons to 443,000,000 tons,--as a result in a minor degree of
loss of material and labor, but owing chiefly to a relaxation of
physical effort after the privations and sufferings of the war, a lack
of rolling-stock and transport, and the unsettled political fate of some
of the mining districts.

[49] Numerous commercial agreements during the war ware
arranged on these lines. But in the month of June, 1919, alone, minor
agreements providing for payment in coal were made by Germany with
Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland. The amounts involved were not large,
but without them Germany could not have obtained butter from Denmark,
fats and herrings from Norway, or milk and cattle from Switzerland.

[50] "Some 60,000 Ruhr miners have agreed to work extra
shifts--so-called butter-shifts--for the purpose of furnishing coal for
export to Denmark hence butter will be exported in return. The butter
will benefit the miners in the first place, as they have worked
specially to obtain it" (_Kˆlnische Zeitung_, June 11, 1919).

[51] What of the prospects of whisky-shifts in England?

[52] As early as September, 1919, the Coal Commission had to
face the physical impracticability of enforcing the demands of the
Treaty, and agreed to modify them as follows:--"Germany shall in the
next six months make deliveries corresponding to an annual delivery of
20 million tons as compared with 43 millions as provided in the Peace
Treaty. If Germany's total production exceeds the present level of about
108 millions a year, 60 per cent of extra production, up to 128
millions, shall be delivered to the Entente and 50 per cent of any extra
beyond that, until the figure provided in the Peace Treaty is reached.
If the total production falls below 108 millions the Entente will
examine the situation, after hearing Germany, and take account of it."

[53] 21,136,265 tons out of a total of 28,607,903 tons. The
loss of iron-ore in respect of Upper Silesia is insignificant. The
exclusion of the iron and steel of Luxemburg from the German Customs
Union is, however, important, especially when this loss is added to that
of Alsace-Lorraine. It may be added in passing that Upper Silesia
includes 75 per cent of the zinc production of Germany.

[54] In April, 1919, the British Ministry of Munitions
despatched an expert Commission to examine the conditions of the iron
and steel works in Lorraine and the occupied areas of Germany. The
Report states that the iron and steel works in Lorraine, and to a lesser
extent in the Saar Valley, are dependent on supplies of coal and coke
from Westphalia. It is necessary to mix Westphalian coal with Saar coal
to obtain a good furnace coke. The entire dependence of all the Lorraine
iron and steel works upon Germany for fuel supplies "places them," says
the Report, "in a very unenviable position."

[55] Arts. 264, 265, 266, and 267. These provisions can only be
extended beyond five years by the Council of the League of Nations.

[56] Art. 268 (_a_).

[57] Art. 268 (_b_) and (_c_).

[58] The Grand Duchy is also deneutralized and Germany binds
herself to "accept in advance all international arrangements which may
be concluded by the Allied and Associated Powers relating to the Grand
Duchy" (Art. 40). At the end of September, 1919, a plebiscite was held
to determine whether Luxemburg should join the French or the Belgian
Customs Union, which decided by a substantial majority in favour of the
former. The third alternative of the maintenance of the union with
Germany was not left open to the electorate.

[59] Art. 269.

[60] Art. 270.

[61] The occupation provisions may be conveniently summarized
at this point. German territory situated west of the Rhine, together
with the bridge-heads, is subject to occupation for a period of fifteen
years (Art. 428). If, however, "the conditions of the present Treaty are
faithfully carried out by Germany," the Cologne district will be
evacuated after five years, and the Coblenz district after ten years
(Art. 429). It is, however, further provided that if at the expiration
of fifteen years "the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by
Germany are not considered sufficient by the Allied and Associated
Governments, the evacuation of the occupying troops may be delayed to
the extent regarded as necessary for the purpose of obtaining the
required guarantees" (Art. 429); and also that "in case either during
the occupation or after the expiration of the fifteen years, the
Reparation Commission finds that Germany refuses to observe the whole or
part of her obligations under the present Treaty with regard to
Reparation, the whole or part of the areas specified in Article 429 will
be re-occupied immediately by the Allied and Associated Powers" (Art.
430). Since it will be impossible for Germany to fulfil the whole of her
Reparation obligations, the effect of the above provisions will be in
practice that the Allies will occupy the left bank of the Rhine just so
long as they choose. They will also govern it in such manner as they may
determine (_e.g._ not only as regards customs, but such matters as the
respective authority of the local German representatives and the Allied
Governing Commission), since "all matters relating to the occupation and
not provided for by the present Treaty shall be regulated by subsequent
agreements, which Germany hereby undertakes to observe" (Art. 432). The
actual Agreement under which the occupied areas are to be administered
for the present has been published as a White Paper [Cd. 222]. The
supreme authority is to be in the hands of an Inter-Allied Rhineland
Commission, consisting of a Belgian, a French, a British, and an
American member. The articles of this Agreement are very fairly and
reasonably drawn.

[62] Art. 365. After five years this Article is subject to
revision by the Council of the League of Nations.

[63] The German Government withdrew, as from September 1, 1919,
all preferential railway tariffs for the export of iron and steel goods,
on the ground that these privileges would have been more than
counterbalanced by the corresponding privileges which, under this
Article of the Treaty, they would have been forced to give to Allied
traders.

[64] Art. 367.

[65] Questions of interpretation and application are to be
referred to the League of Nations (Art. 376).

[66] Art. 250.

[67] Art 371. This provision is even applied "to the lines of
former Russian Poland converted by Germany to the German gage, such
lines being regarded as detached from the Prussian State System."

[68] Arts. 332-337. Exception may be taken, however, to the
second paragraph of Art. 332, which allows the vessels of other nations
to trade between German towns but forbids German vessels to trade
between non-German towns except with special permission; and Art. 333,
which prohibits Germany from making use of her river system as a source
of revenue, may be injudicious.

[69] The Niemen and the Moselle are to be similarly treated at
a later date if required.

[70] Art. 338.

[71] Art. 344. This is with particular reference to the Elbe

CHAPTER V

REPARATION


I. _Undertakings given prior to the Peace Negotiations_

The categories of damage in respect of which the Allies were entitled to
ask for Reparation are governed by the relevant passages in President
Wilson's Fourteen Points of January 8, 1918, as modified by the Allied
Governments in their qualifying Note, the text of which the President
formally communicated to the German Government as the basis of peace on
November 5, 1918. These passages have been quoted in full at the
beginning of Chapter IV. That is to say, "compensation will be made by
Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and
to their property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from
the air." The limiting quality of this sentence is reinforced by the
passage in the President's speech before Congress on February 11, 1918
(the terms of this speech being an express part of the contract with the
enemy), that there shall be "no contributions" and "no punitive
damages."

It has sometimes been argued that the preamble to paragraph 19[76] of
the Armistice Terms, to the effect "that any future claims and demands
of the Allies and the United States of America remain unaffected," wiped
out all precedent conditions, and left the Allies free to make whatever
demands they chose. But it is not possible to maintain that this casual
protective phrase, to which no one at the time attached any particular
importance, did away with all the formal communications which passed
between the President and the German Government as to the basis of the
Terms of Peace during the days preceding the Armistice, abolished the
Fourteen Points, and converted the German acceptance of the Armistice
Terms into unconditional surrender, so far as it affects the Financial
Clauses. It is merely the usual phrase of the draftsman, who, about to
rehearse a list of certain claims, wishes to guard himself from the
implication that such list is exhaustive. In any case, this contention
is disposed of by the Allied reply to the German observations on the
first draft of the Treaty, where it is admitted that the terms of the
Reparation Chapter must be governed by the President's Note of November
5.

Assuming then that the terms of this Note are binding, we are left to
elucidate the precise force of the phrase--"all damage done to the
civilian population of the Allies and to their property by the
aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air." Few sentences
in history have given so much work to the sophists and the lawyers, as
we shall see in the next section of this chapter, as this apparently
simple and unambiguous statement. Some have not scrupled to argue that
it covers the entire cost of the war; for, they point out, the entire
cost of the war has to be met by taxation, and such taxation is
"damaging to the civilian population." They admit that the phrase is
cumbrous, and that it would have been simpler to have said "all loss and
expenditure of whatever description"; and they allow that the apparent
emphasis of damage to the persons and property of _civilians_ is
unfortunate; but errors of draftsmanship should not, in their opinion,
shut off the Allies from the rights inherent in victors.

But there are not only the limitations of the phrase in its natural
meaning and the emphasis on civilian damages as distinct from military
expenditure generally; it must also be remembered that the context of
the term is in elucidation of the meaning of the term "restoration" in
the President's Fourteen Points. The Fourteen Points provide for damage
in invaded territory--Belgium, France, Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro
(Italy being unaccountably omitted)--but they do not cover losses at sea
by submarine, bombardments from the sea (as at Scarborough), or damage
done by air raids. It was to repair these omissions, which involved
losses to the life and property of civilians not really distinguishable
in kind from those effected in occupied territory, that the Supreme
Council of the Allies in Paris proposed to President Wilson their
qualifications. At that time--the last days of October, 1918--I do not
believe that any responsible statesman had in mind the exaction from
Germany of an indemnity for the general costs of the war. They sought
only to make it clear (a point of considerable importance to Great
Britain) that reparation for damage done to non-combatants and their
property was not limited to invaded territory (as it would have been by
the Fourteen Points unqualified), but applied equally to _all_ such
damage, whether "by land, by sea, or from the air" It was only at a
later stage that a general popular demand for an indemnity, covering
the full costs of the war, made it politically desirable to practise
dishonesty and to try to discover in the written word what was not
there.

What damages, then, can be claimed from the enemy on a strict
interpretation of our engagements?[77] In the case of the United Kingdom
the bill would cover the following items:--

(a) Damage to civilian life and property by the acts of an enemy
Government including damage by air raids, naval bombardments, submarine
warfare, and mines.

(b) Compensation for improper treatment of interned civilians.

It would not include the general costs of the war, or (_e.g._) indirect
damage due to loss of trade.

The French claim would include, as well as items corresponding to the
above:--

(c) Damage done to the property and persons of civilians in the war
area, and by aerial warfare behind the enemy lines.

(d) Compensation for loot of food, raw materials, live-stock, machinery,
household effects, timber, and the like by the enemy Governments or
their nationals in territory occupied by them.

(e) Repayment of fines and requisitions levied by the enemy Governments
or their officers on French municipalities or nationals.

(f) Compensation to French nationals deported or compelled to do forced
labor.

In addition to the above there is a further item of more doubtful
character, namely--

(g) The expenses of the Relief Commission in providing necessary food
and clothing to maintain the civilian French population in the
enemy-occupied districts.

The Belgian claim would include similar items.[78] If it were argued
that in the case of Belgium something more nearly resembling an
indemnity for general war costs can be justified, this could only be on
the ground of the breach of International Law involved in the invasion
of Belgium, whereas, as we have seen, the Fourteen Points include no
special demands on this ground.[79] As the cost of Belgian Belief under
(g), as well as her general war costs, has been met already by advances
from the British, French, and United States Governments, Belgium would
presumably employ any repayment of them by Germany in part discharge of
her debt to these Governments, so that any such demands are, in effect,
an addition to the claims of the three lending Governments.

The claims of the other Allies would be compiled on similar lines. But
in their case the question arises more acutely how far Germany can be
made contingently liable for damage done, not by herself, but by her
co-belligerents, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. This is one of
the many questions to which the Fourteen Points give no clear answer; on
the one hand, they cover explicitly in Point 11 damage done to Roumania,
Serbia, and Montenegro, without qualification as to the nationality of
the troops inflicting the damage; on the other hand, the Note of the
Allies speaks of "German" aggression when it might have spoken of the
aggression of "Germany and her allies." On a strict and literal
interpretation, I doubt if claims lie against Germany for damage
done,--_e.g._ by the Turks to the Suez Canal, or by Austrian submarines
in the Adriatic. But it is a case where, if the Allies wished to strain
a point, they could impose contingent liability on Germany without
running seriously contrary to the general intention of their
engagements.

As between the Allies themselves the case is quite different. It would
be an act of gross unfairness and infidelity if France and Great Britain
were to take what Germany could pay and leave Italy and Serbia to get
what they could out of the remains of Austria-Hungary. As amongst the
Allies themselves it is clear that assets should be pooled and shared
out in proportion to aggregate claims.

In this event, and if my estimate is accepted, as given below, that
Germany's capacity to pay will be exhausted by the direct and legitimate
claims which the Allies hold against her, the question of her contingent
liability for her allies becomes academic. Prudent and honorable
statesmanship would therefore have given her the benefit of the doubt,
and claimed against her nothing but the damage she had herself caused.

What, on the above basis of claims, would the aggregate demand amount
to? No figures exist on which to base any scientific or exact estimate,
and I give my own guess for what it is worth, prefacing it with the
following observations.

The amount of the material damage done in the invaded districts has been
the subject of enormous, if natural, exaggeration. A journey through the
devastated areas of France is impressive to the eye and the imagination
beyond description. During the winter of 1918-19, before Nature had
cast over the scene her ameliorating mantle, the horror and desolation
of war was made visible to sight on an extraordinary scale of blasted
grandeur. The completeness of the destruction was evident. For mile
after mile nothing was left. No building was habitable and no field fit
for the plow. The sameness was also striking. One devastated area was
exactly like another--a heap of rubble, a morass of shell-holes, and a
tangle of wire.[80] The amount of human labor which would be required to
restore such a countryside seemed incalculable; and to the returned
traveler any number of milliards of dollars was inadequate to express in
matter the destruction thus impressed upon his spirit. Some Governments
for a variety of intelligible reasons have not been ashamed to exploit
these feelings a little.

Popular sentiment is most at fault, I think, in the case of Belgium. In
any event Belgium is a small country, and in its case the actual area of
devastation is a small proportion of the whole. The first onrush of the
Germans in 1914 did some damage locally; after that the battle-line in
Belgium did not sway backwards and forwards, as in France, over a deep
belt of country. It was practically stationary, and hostilities were
confined to a small corner of the country, much of which in recent times
was backward, poor, and sleepy, and did not include the active industry
of the country. There remains some injury in the small flooded area, the
deliberate damage done by the retreating Germans to buildings, plant,
and transport, and the loot of machinery, cattle, and other movable
property. But Brussels, Antwerp, and even Ostend are substantially
intact, and the great bulk of the land, which is Belgium's chief wealth,
is nearly as well cultivated as before. The traveler by motor can pass
through and from end to end of the devastated area of Belgium almost
before he knows it; whereas the destruction in France is on a different
kind of scale altogether. Industrially, the loot has been serious and
for the moment paralyzing; but the actual money cost of replacing
machinery mounts up slowly, and a few tens of millions would have
covered the value of every machine of every possible description that
Belgium ever possessed. Besides, the cold statistician must not overlook
the fact that the Belgian people possess the instinct of individual
self-protection unusually well developed; and the great mass of German
bank-notes[81] held in the country at the date of the Armistice, shows
that certain classes of them at least found a way, in spite of all the
severities and barbarities of German rule, to profit at the expense of
the invader. Belgian claims against Germany such as I have seen,
amounting to a sum in excess of the total estimated pre-war wealth of
the whole country, are simply irresponsible.[82]

It will help to guide our ideas to quote the official survey of Belgian
wealth, published in 1913 by the Finance Ministry of Belgium, which was
as follows:

    Land                 $1,320,000,000
    Buildings             1,175,000,000
    Personal wealth       2,725,000,000
    Cash                     85,000,000
    Furniture, etc          600,000,000
                         --------------
                         $5,905,000,000

This total yields an average of $780 per inhabitant, which Dr. Stamp,
the highest authority on the subject, is disposed to consider as _prima
facie_ too low (though he does not accept certain much higher estimates
lately current), the corresponding wealth per head (to take Belgium's
immediate neighbors) being $835 for Holland, $1,220 for Germany, and
$1,515 for France.[83] A total of $7,500,000,000, giving an average of
about $1,000 per head, would, however, be fairly liberal. The official
estimate of land and buildings is likely to be more accurate than the
rest. On the other hand, allowance has to be made for the increased
costs of construction.

Having regard to all these considerations, I do not put the money value
of the actual _physical_ loss of Belgian property by destruction and
loot above $750,000,000 _as a maximum_, and while I hesitate to put yet
lower an estimate which differs so widely from those generally current,
I shall be surprised if it proves possible to substantiate claims even
to this amount. Claims in respect of levies, fines, requisitions, and so
forth might possibly amount to a further $500,000,000. If the sums
advanced to Belgium by her allies for the general costs of the war are
to be included, a sum of about $1,250,000,000 has to be added (which
includes the cost of relief), bringing the total to $2,500,000,000.

The destruction in France was on an altogether more significant scale,
not only as regards the length of the battle line, but also on account
of the immensely deeper area of country over which the battle swayed
from time to time. It is a popular delusion to think of Belgium as the
principal victim of the war; it will turn out, I believe, that taking
account of casualties, loss of property and burden of future debt,
Belgium has made the least relative sacrifice of all the belligerents
except the United States. Of the Allies, Serbia's sufferings and loss
have been proportionately the greatest, and after Serbia, France. France
in all essentials was just as much the victim of German ambition as was
Belgium, and France's entry into the war was just as unavoidable.
France, in my judgment, in spite of her policy at the Peace Conference,
a policy largely traceable to her sufferings, has the greatest claims on
our generosity.

The special position occupied by Belgium in the popular mind is due, of
course, to the fact that in 1914 her sacrifice was by far the greatest
of any of the Allies. But after 1914 she played a minor rÙle.
Consequently, by the end of 1918, her relative sacrifices, apart from
those sufferings from invasion which cannot be measured in money, had
fallen behind, and in some respects they were not even as great, for
example, as Australia's. I say this with no wish to evade the
obligations towards Belgium under which the pronouncements of our
responsible statesmen at many different dates have certainly laid us.
Great Britain ought not to seek any payment at all from Germany for
herself until the just claims of Belgium have been fully satisfied. But
this is no reason why we or they should not tell the truth about the
amount.

While the French claims are immensely greater, here too there has been
excessive exaggeration, as responsible French statisticians have
themselves pointed out. Not above 10 per cent of the area of France was
effectively occupied by the enemy, and not above 4 per cent lay within
the area of substantial devastation. Of the sixty French towns having a
population exceeding 35,000, only two were destroyed--Reims (115,178)
and St. Quentin (55,571); three others were occupied--Lille, Roubaix,
and Douai--and suffered from loot of machinery and other property, but
were not substantially injured otherwise. Amiens, Calais, Dunkerque, and
Boulogne suffered secondary damage by bombardment and from the air; but
the value of Calais and Boulogne must have been increased by the new
works of various kinds erected for the use of the British Army.

The _Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1917_, values the entire house
property of France at $11,900,000,000 (59.5 milliard francs).[84] An
estimate current in France of $4,000,000,000 (20 milliard francs) for
the destruction of house property alone is, therefore, obviously wide of
the mark.[85] $600,000,000 at pre-war prices, or say $1,250,000,000 at
the present time, is much nearer the right figure. Estimates of the
value of the land of France (apart from buildings) vary from
$12,400,000,000 to $15,580,000,000, so that it would be extravagant to
put the damage on this head as high as $500,000,000. Farm Capital for
the whole of France has not been put by responsible authorities above
$2,100,000,000.[86] There remain the loss of furniture and machinery,
the damage to the coal-mines and the transport system, and many other
minor items. But these losses, however serious, cannot be reckoned in
value by hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of so small a part
of France. In short, it will be difficult to establish a bill exceeding
$2,500,000,000 for _physical and material_ damage in the occupied and
devastated areas of Northern France.[87] I am confirmed in this estimate
by the opinion of M. RenÈ Pupin, the author of the most comprehensive
and scientific estimate of the pre-war wealth of France,[88] which I did
not come across until after my own figure had been arrived at. This
authority estimates the material losses of the invaded regions at from
$2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 (10 to 15 milliards),[89] between which
my own figure falls half-way.

Nevertheless, M. Dubois, speaking on behalf of the Budget Commission of
the Chamber, has given the figure of $13,000,000,000 (65 milliard
francs) "as a minimum" without counting "war levies, losses at sea, the
roads, or the loss of public monuments." And M. Loucheur, the Minister
of Industrial Reconstruction, stated before the Senate on the 17th
February, 1919, that the reconstitution of the devastated regions would
involve an expenditure of $15,000,000,000 (75 milliard francs),--more
than double M. Pupin's estimate of the entire wealth of their
inhabitants. But then at that time M. Loucheur was taking a prominent
part in advocating the claims of France before the Peace Conference,
and, like others, may have found strict veracity inconsistent with the
demands of patriotism.[90]

The figure discussed so far is not, however, the totality of the French
claims. There remain, in particular, levies and requisitions on the
occupied areas and the losses of the French mercantile marine at sea
from the attacks of German cruisers and submarines. Probably
$1,000,000,000 would be ample to cover all such claims; but to be on the
safe side, we will, somewhat arbitrarily, make an addition to the French
claim of $1,500,000,000 on all heads, bringing it to $4,000,000,000 in
all.

The statements of M. Dubois and M. Loucheur were made in the early
spring of 1919. A speech delivered by M. Klotz before the French Chamber
six months later (Sept. 5, 1919) was less excusable. In this speech the
French Minister of Finance estimated the total French claims for damage
to property (presumably inclusive of losses at sea, etc., but apart from
pensions and allowances) at $26,800,000,000 (134 milliard francs), or
more than six times my estimate. Even if my figure prove erroneous, M.
Klotz's can never have been justified. So grave has been the deception
practised on the French people by their Ministers that when the
inevitable enlightenment comes, as it soon must (both as to their own
claims and as to Germany's capacity to meet them), the repercussions
will strike at more than M. Klotz, and may even involve the order of
Government and Society for which he stands.

British claims on the present basis would be practically limited to
losses by sea--losses of hulls and losses of cargoes. Claims would lie,
of course, for damage to civilian property in air raids and by
bombardment from the sea, but in relation to such figures as we are now
dealing with, the money value involved is insignificant,--$25,000,000
might cover them all, and $50,000,000 would certainly do so.

The British mercantile vessels lost by enemy action, excluding fishing
vessels, numbered 2479, with an aggregate of 7,759,090 tons gross.[91]
There is room for considerable divergence of opinion as to the proper
rate to take for replacement cost; at the figure of $150 per gross ton,
which with the rapid growth of shipbuilding may soon be too high but can
be replaced by any other which better authorities[92] may prefer, the
aggregate claim is $1,150,000,000. To this must be added the loss of
cargoes, the value of which is almost entirely a matter of guesswork. An
estimate of $200 per ton of shipping lost may be as good an
approximation as is possible, that is to say $1,550,000,000, making
$2,700,000,000 altogether.

An addition to this of $150,000,000, to cover air raids, bombardments,
claims of interned civilians, and miscellaneous items of every
description, should be more than sufficient,--making a total claim for
Great Britain of $2,850,000,000. It is surprising, perhaps, that the
money value of Great Britain's claim should be so little short of that
of France and actually in excess of that of Belgium. But, measured
either by pecuniary loss or real loss to the economic power of the
country, the injury to her mercantile marine was enormous.

There remain the claims of Italy, Serbia, and Roumania for damage by
invasion and of these and other countries, as for example Greece,[93]
for losses at sea. I will assume for the present argument that these
claims rank against Germany, even when they were directly caused not by
her but by her allies; but that it is not proposed to enter any such
claims on behalf of Russia.[94] Italy's losses by invasion and at sea
cannot be very heavy, and a figure of from $250,000,000 to $500,000,000
would be fully adequate to cover them. The losses of Serbia, although
from a human point of view her sufferings were the greatest of all,[95]
are not measured _pecuniarily_ by very great figures, on account of her
low economic development. Dr. Stamp (_loc. cit._) quotes an estimate by
the Italian statistician Maroi, which puts the national wealth of Serbia
at $2,400,000,000 or $525 per head,[96] and the greater part of this
would be represented by land which has sustained no permanent
damage.[97] In view of the very inadequate data for guessing at more
than the _general magnitude_ of the legitimate claims of this group of
countries, I prefer to make one guess rather than several and to put the
figure for the whole group at the round sum of $1,250,000,000.

We are finally left with the following--

    Belgium        $ 2,500,000,000[98]
    France           4,000,000,000
    Great Britain    2,850,000,000
    Other Allies     1,250,000,000
                   ---------------
    Total          $10,600,000,000

I need not impress on the reader that there is much guesswork in the
above, and the figure for France in particular is likely to be
criticized. But I feel some confidence that the _general magnitude_, as
distinct from the precise figures, is not hopelessly erroneous; and this
may be expressed by the statement that a claim against Germany, based on
the interpretation of the pre-Armistice engagements of the Allied
Powers which is adopted above, would assuredly be found to exceed
$8,000,000,000 and to fall short of $15,000,000,000.

This is the amount of the claim which we were entitled to present to the
enemy. For reasons which will appear more fully later on, I believe that
it would have been a wise and just act to have asked the German
Government at the Peace Negotiations to agree to a sum of
$10,000,000,000 in final settlement, without further examination of
particulars. This would have provided an immediate and certain solution,
and would have required from Germany a sum which, if she were granted
certain indulgences, it might not have proved entirely impossible for
her to pay. This sum should have been divided up amongst the Allies
themselves on a basis of need and general equity.

But the question was not settled on its merits.


II. _The Conference and the Terms of the Treaty_

I do not believe that, at the date of the Armistice, responsible
authorities in the Allied countries expected any indemnity from Germany
beyond the cost of reparation for the direct material damage which had
resulted from the invasion of Allied territory and from the submarine
campaign. At that time there were serious doubts as to whether Germany
intended to accept our terms, which in other respects were inevitably
very severe, and it would have been thought an unstatesmanlike act to
risk a continuance of the war by demanding a money payment which Allied
opinion was not then anticipating and which probably could not be
secured in any case. The French, I think, never quite accepted this
point of view; but it was certainly the British attitude; and in this
atmosphere the pre-Armistice conditions were framed.

A month later the atmosphere had changed completely. We had discovered
how hopeless the German position really was, a discovery which some,
though not all, had anticipated, but which no one had dared reckon on as
a certainty. It was evident that we could have secured unconditional
surrender if we had determined to get it.

But there was another new factor in the situation which was of greater
local importance. The British Prime Minister had perceived that the
conclusion of hostilities might soon bring with it the break-up of the
political _bloc_ upon which he was depending for his personal
ascendency, and that the domestic difficulties which would be attendant
on demobilization, the turn-over of industry from war to peace
conditions, the financial situation, and the general psychological
reactions of men's minds, would provide his enemies with powerful
weapons, if he were to leave them time to mature. The best chance,
therefore, of consolidating his power, which was personal and exercised,
as such, independently of party or principle, to an extent unusual in
British politics, evidently lay in active hostilities before the
prestige of victory had abated, and in an attempt to found on the
emotions of the moment a new basis of power which might outlast the
inevitable reactions of the near future. Within a brief period,
therefore, after the Armistice, the popular victor, at the height of his
influence and his authority, decreed a General Election. It was widely
recognized at the time as an act of political immorality. There were no
grounds of public interest which did not call for a short delay until
the issues of the new age had a little defined themselves and until the
country had something more specific before it on which to declare its
mind and to instruct its new representatives. But the claims of private
ambition determined otherwise.

For a time all went well. But before the campaign was far advanced
Government candidates were finding themselves handicapped by the lack of
an effective cry. The War Cabinet was demanding a further lease of
authority on the ground of having won the war. But partly because the
new issues had not yet defined themselves, partly out of regard for the
delicate balance of a Coalition Party, the Prime Minister's future
policy was the subject of silence or generalities. The campaign seemed,
therefore, to fall a little flat. In the light of subsequent events it
seems improbable that the Coalition Party was ever in real danger. But
party managers are easily "rattled." The Prime Minister's more neurotic
advisers told him that he was not safe from dangerous surprises, and the
Prime Minister lent an ear to them. The party managers demanded more
"ginger." The Prime Minister looked about for some.

On the assumption that the return of the Prime Minister to power was the
primary consideration, the rest followed naturally. At that juncture
there was a clamor from certain quarters that the Government had given
by no means sufficiently clear undertakings that they were not going "to
let the Hun off." Mr. Hughes was evoking a good deal of attention by his
demands for a very large indemnity,[99] and Lord Northcliffe was lending
his powerful aid to the same cause. This pointed the Prime Minister to
a stone for two birds. By himself adopting the policy of Mr. Hughes and
Lord Northcliffe, he could at the same time silence those powerful
critics and provide his party managers with an effective platform cry to
drown the increasing voices of criticism from other quarters.

The progress of the General Election of 1918 affords a sad, dramatic
history of the essential weakness of one who draws his chief inspiration
not from his own true impulses, but from the grosser effluxions of the
atmosphere which momentarily surrounds him. The Prime Minister's natural
instincts, as they so often are, were right and reasonable. He himself
did not believe in hanging the Kaiser or in the wisdom or the
possibility of a great indemnity. On the 22nd of November he and Mr.
Bonar Law issued their Election Manifesto. It contains no allusion of
any kind either to the one or to the other but, speaking, rather, of
Disarmament and the League of Nations, concludes that "our first task
must be to conclude a just and lasting peace, and so to establish the
foundations of a new Europe that occasion for further wars may be for
ever averted." In his speech at Wolverhampton on the eve of the
Dissolution (November 24), there is no word of Reparation or Indemnity.
On the following day at Glasgow, Mr. Bonar Law would promise nothing.
"We are going to the Conference," he said, "as one of a number of
allies, and you cannot expect a member of the Government, whatever he
may think, to state in public before he goes into that Conference, what
line he is going to take in regard to any particular question." But a
few days later at Newcastle (November 29) the Prime Minister was warming
to his work: "When Germany defeated France she made France pay. That is
the principle which she herself has established. There is absolutely no
doubt about the principle, and that is the principle we should proceed
upon--that Germany must pay the costs of the war up to the limit of her
capacity to do so." But he accompanied this statement of principle with
many "words of warning" as to the practical difficulties of the case:
"We have appointed a strong Committee of experts, representing every
shade of opinion, to consider this question very carefully and to advise
us. There is no doubt as to the justice of the demand. She ought to pay,
she must pay as far as she can, but we are not going to allow her to pay
in such a way as to wreck our industries." At this stage the Prime
Minister sought to indicate that he intended great severity, without
raising excessive hopes of actually getting the money, or committing
himself to a particular line of action at the Conference. It was
rumored that a high city authority had committed himself to the opinion
that Germany could certainly pay $100,000,000,000 and that this
authority for his part would not care to discredit a figure of twice
that sum. The Treasury officials, as Mr. Lloyd George indicated, took a
different view. He could, therefore, shelter himself behind the wide
discrepancy between the opinions of his different advisers, and regard
the precise figure of Germany's capacity to pay as an open question in
the treatment of which he must do his best for his country's interests.
As to our engagements under the Fourteen Points he was always silent.

On November 30, Mr. Barnes, a member of the War Cabinet, in which he was
supposed to represent Labor, shouted from a platform, "I am for hanging
the Kaiser."

On December 6, the Prime Minister issued a statement of policy and aims
in which he stated, with significant emphasis on the word _European_,
that "All the European Allies have accepted the principle that the
Central Powers must pay the cost of the war up to the limit of their
capacity."

But it was now little more than a week to Polling Day, and still he had
not said enough to satisfy the appetites of the moment. On December 8,
the _Times_, providing as usual a cloak of ostensible decorum for the
lesser restraint of its associates, declared in a leader entitled
"Making Germany Pay," that "The public mind was still bewildered by the
Prime Minister's various statements." "There is too much suspicion,"
they added, "of influences concerned to let the Germans off lightly,
whereas the only possible motive in determining their capacity to pay
must be the interests of the Allies." "It is the candidate who deals
with the issues of to-day," wrote their Political Correspondent, "who
adopts Mr. Barnes's phrase about 'hanging the Kaiser' and plumps for the
payment of the cost of the war by Germany, who rouses his audience and
strikes the notes to which they are most responsive."

On December 9, at the Queen's Hall, the Prime Minister avoided the
subject. But from now on, the debauchery of thought and speech
progressed hour by hour. The grossest spectacle was provided by Sir Eric
Geddes in the Guildhall at Cambridge. An earlier speech in which, in a
moment of injudicious candor, he had cast doubts on the possibility of
extracting from Germany the whole cost of the war had been the object of
serious suspicion, and he had therefore a reputation to regain. "We will
get out of her all you can squeeze out of a lemon and a bit more," the
penitent shouted, "I will squeeze her until you can hear the pips
squeak"; his policy was to take every bit of property belonging to
Germans in neutral and Allied countries, and all her gold and silver and
her jewels, and the contents of her picture-galleries and libraries, to
sell the proceeds for the Allies' benefit. "I would strip Germany," he
cried, "as she has stripped Belgium."

By December 11 the Prime Minister had capitulated. His Final Manifesto
of Six Points issued on that day to the electorate furnishes a
melancholy comparison with his program of three weeks earlier. I quote
it in full:

    "1. Trial of the Kaiser.
     2. Punishment of those responsible for atrocities.
     3. Fullest Indemnities from Germany.
     4. Britain for the British, socially and industrially.
     5. Rehabilitation of those broken in the war.
     6. A happier country for all."

Here is food for the cynic. To this concoction of greed and sentiment,
prejudice and deception, three weeks of the platform had reduced the
powerful governors of England, who but a little while before had spoken
not ignobly of Disarmament and a League of Nations and of a just and
lasting peace which should establish the foundations of a new Europe.

On the same evening the Prime Minister at Bristol withdrew in effect his
previous reservations and laid down four principles to govern his
Indemnity Policy, of which the chief were: First, we have an absolute
right to demand the whole cost of the war; second, we propose to demand
the whole cost of the war; and third, a Committee appointed by direction
of the Cabinet believe that it can be done.[100] Four days later he went
to the polls.

The Prime Minister never said that he himself believed that Germany
could pay the whole cost of the war. But the program became in the
mouths of his supporters on the hustings a great deal more than
concrete. The ordinary voter was led to believe that Germany could
certainly be made to pay the greater part, if not the whole cost of the
war. Those whose practical and selfish fears for the future the expenses
of the war had aroused, and those whose emotions its horrors had
disordered, were both provided for. A vote for a Coalition candidate
meant the Crucifixion of Anti-Christ and the assumption by Germany of
the British National Debt.

It proved an irresistible combination, and once more Mr. George's
political instinct was not at fault. No candidate could safely denounce
this program, and none did so. The old Liberal Party, having nothing
comparable to offer to the electorate, was swept out of existence.[101]
A new House of Commons came into being, a majority of whose members had
pledged themselves to a great deal more than the Prime Minister's
guarded promises. Shortly after their arrival at Westminster I asked a
Conservative friend, who had known previous Houses, what he thought of
them. "They are a lot of hard-faced men," he said, "who look as if they
had done very well out of the war."

This was the atmosphere in which the Prime Minister left for Paris, and
these the entanglements he had made for himself. He had pledged himself
and his Government to make demands of a helpless enemy inconsistent with
solemn engagements on our part, on the faith of which this enemy had
laid down his arms. There are few episodes in history which posterity
will have less reason to condone,--a war ostensibly waged in defense of
the sanctity of international engagements ending in a definite breach of
one of the most sacred possible of such engagements on the part of
victorious champions of these ideals.[102]

Apart from other aspects of the transaction, I believe that the
campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was
one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our
statesmen have ever been responsible. To what a different future Europe
might have looked forward if either Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Wilson had
apprehended that the most serious of the problems which claimed their
attention were not political or territorial but financial and economic,
and that the perils of the future lay not in frontiers or sovereignties
but in food, coal, and transport. Neither of them paid adequate
attention to these problems at any stage of the Conference. But in any
event the atmosphere for the wise and reasonable consideration of them
was hopelessly befogged by the commitments of the British delegation on
the question of Indemnities. The hopes to which the Prime Minister had
given rise not only compelled him to advocate an unjust and unworkable
economic basis to the Treaty with Germany, but set him at variance with
the President, and on the other hand with competing interests to those
of France and Belgium. The clearer it became that but little could be
expected from Germany, the more necessary it was to exercise patriotic
greed and "sacred egotism" and snatch the bone from the juster claims
and greater need of France or the well-founded expectations of Belgium.
Yet the financial problems which were about to exercise Europe could not
be solved by greed. The possibility of _their_ cure lay in magnanimity.

Europe, if she is to survive her troubles, will need so much magnanimity
from America, that she must herself practice it. It is useless for the
Allies, hot from stripping Germany and one another, to turn for help to
the United States to put the States of Europe, including Germany, on to
their feet again. If the General Election of December, 1918, had been
fought on lines of prudent generosity instead of imbecile greed, how
much better the financial prospect of Europe might now be. I still
believe that before the main Conference, or very early in its
proceedings, the representatives of Great Britain should have entered
deeply, with those of the United States, into the economic and financial
situation as a whole, and that the former should have been authorized to
make concrete proposals on the general lines (1) that all inter-allied
indebtedness be canceled outright; (2) that the sum to be paid by
Germany be fixed at $10,000,000,000; (3) that Great Britain renounce all
claim to participation in this sum and that any share to which she
proves entitled be placed at the disposal of the Conference for the
purpose of aiding the finances of the New States about to be
established; (4) that in order to make some basis of credit immediately
available an appropriate proportion of the German obligations
representing the sum to be paid by her should be guaranteed by all
parties to the Treaty; and (5) that the ex-enemy Powers should also be
allowed, with a view to their economic restoration, to issue a moderate
amount of bonds carrying a similar guarantee. Such proposals involved an
appeal to the generosity of the United States. But that was inevitable;
and, in view of her far less financial sacrifices, it was an appeal
which could fairly have been made to her. Such proposals would have been
practicable. There is nothing in them quixotic or Utopian. And they
would have opened up for Europe some prospect of financial stability and
reconstruction.

The further elaboration of these ideas, however, must be left to Chapter
VII., and we must return to Paris. I have described the entanglements
which Mr. Lloyd George took with him. The position of the Finance
Ministers of the other Allies was even worse. We in Great Britain had
not based our financial arrangements on any expectations of an
indemnity. Receipts from such a source would have been more or less in
the nature of a windfall; and, in spite of subsequent developments,
there was an expectation at that time of balancing our budget by normal
methods. But this was not the case with France or Italy. Their peace
budgets made no pretense of balancing and had no prospects of doing so,
without some far-reaching revision of the existing policy. Indeed, the
position was and remains nearly hopeless. These countries were heading
for national bankruptcy. This fact could only be concealed by holding
out the expectation of vast receipts from the enemy. As soon as it was
admitted that it was in fact impossible to make Germany pay the expenses
of both sides, and that the unloading of their liabilities upon the
enemy was not practicable, the position of the Ministers of Finance of
France and Italy became untenable.

Thus a scientific consideration of Germany's capacity to pay was from
the outset out of court. The expectations which the exigencies of
politics had made it necessary to raise were so very remote from the
truth that a slight distortion of figures was no use, and it was
necessary to ignore the facts entirely. The resulting unveracity was
fundamental. On a basis of so much falsehood it became impossible to
erect any constructive financial policy which was workable. For this
reason amongst others, a magnanimous financial policy was essential. The
financial position of France and Italy was so bad that it was impossible
to make them listen to reason on the subject of the German Indemnity,
unless one could at the same time point out to them some alternative
mode of escape from their troubles.[103] The representatives of the
United States were greatly at fault, in my judgment, for having no
constructive proposals whatever to offer to a suffering and distracted
Europe.

It is worth while to point out in passing a further element in the
situation, namely, the opposition which existed between the "crushing"
policy of M. Clemenceau and the financial necessities of M. Klotz.
Clemenceau's aim was to weaken and destroy Germany in every possible
way, and I fancy that he was always a little contemptuous about the
Indemnity; he had no intention of leaving Germany in a position to
practise a vast commercial activity. But he did not trouble his head to
understand either the indemnity or poor M. Klotz's overwhelming
financial difficulties. If it amused the financiers to put into the
Treaty some very large demands, well there was no harm in that; but the
satisfaction of these demands must not be allowed to interfere with the
essential requirements of a Carthaginian Peace. The combination of the
"real" policy of M. Clemenceau on unreal issues, with M. Klotz's policy
of pretense on what were very real issues indeed, introduced into the
Treaty a whole set of incompatible provisions, over and above the
inherent impracticabilities of the Reparation proposals.

I cannot here describe the endless controversy and intrigue between the
Allies themselves, which at last after some months culminated in the
presentation to Germany of the Reparation Chapter in its final form.
There can have been few negotiations in history so contorted, so
miserable, so utterly unsatisfactory to all parties. I doubt if any one
who took much part in that debate can look back on it without shame. I
must be content with an analysis of the elements of the final compromise
which is known to all the world.

The main point to be settled was, of course, that of the items for which
Germany could fairly be asked to make payment. Mr. Lloyd George's
election pledge to the effect that the Allies were _entitled_ to demand
from Germany the entire costs of the war was from the outset clearly
untenable; or rather, to put it more impartially, it was clear that to
persuade the President of the conformity of this demand with our
pro-Armistice engagements was beyond the powers of the most plausible.
The actual compromise finally reached is to be read as follows in the
paragraphs of the Treaty as it has been published to the world.

Article 231 reads: "The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and
Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing
all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments
and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war
imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies." This is
a well and carefully drafted Article; for the President could read it as
statement of admission on Germany's part of _moral_ responsibility for
bringing about the war, while the Prime Minister could explain it as an
admission of _financial_ liability for the general costs of the war.
Article 232 continues: "The Allied and Associated Governments recognize
that the resources of Germany are not adequate, after taking into
account permanent diminutions of such resources which will result from
other provisions of the present Treaty, to make complete reparation for
all such loss and damage." The President could comfort himself that this
was no more than a statement of undoubted fact, and that to recognize
that Germany _cannot_ pay a certain claim does not imply that she is
_liable_ to pay the claim; but the Prime Minister could point out that
in the context it emphasizes to the reader the assumption of Germany's
theoretic liability asserted in the preceding Article. Article 232
proceeds: "The Allied and Associated Governments, however, require, and
Germany undertakes, that _she will make compensation for all damage done
to the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to
their property_ during the period of the belligerency of each as an
Allied or Associated Power against Germany _by such aggression by land,
by sea, and from the air_, and in general all damage as defined in Annex
I. hereto."[104] The words italicized being practically a quotation from
the pre-Armistice conditions, satisfied the scruples of the President,
while the addition of the words "and in general all damage as defined in
Annex I. hereto" gave the Prime Minister a chance in Annex I.

So far, however, all this is only a matter of words, of virtuosity in
draftsmanship, which does no one any harm, and which probably seemed
much more important at the time than it ever will again between now and
Judgment Day. For substance we must turn to Annex I.

A great part of Annex I. is in strict conformity with the pre-Armistice
conditions, or, at any rate, does not strain them beyond what is fairly
arguable. Paragraph 1 claims damage done for injury to the persons of
civilians, or, in the case of death, to their dependents, as a direct
consequence of acts of war; Paragraph 2, for acts of cruelty, violence,
or maltreatment on the part of the enemy towards civilian victims;
Paragraph 3, for enemy acts injurious to health or capacity to work or
to honor towards civilians in occupied or invaded territory; Paragraph
8, for forced labor exacted by the enemy from civilians; Paragraph 9,
for damage done to property "with the exception of naval and military
works or materials" as a direct consequence of hostilities; and
Paragraph 10, for fines and levies imposed by the enemy upon the
civilian population. All these demands are just and in conformity with
the Allies' rights.

Paragraph 4, which claims for "damage caused by any kind of maltreatment
of prisoners of war," is more doubtful on the strict letter, but may be
justifiable under the Hague Convention and involves a very small sum.

In Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7, however, an issue of immensely greater
significance is involved. These paragraphs assert a claim for the amount
of the Separation and similar Allowances granted during the war by the
Allied Governments to the families of mobilized persons, and for the
amount of the pensions and compensations in respect of the injury or
death of combatants payable by these Governments now and hereafter.
Financially this adds to the Bill, as we shall see below, a very large
amount, indeed about twice as much again as all the other claims added
together.

The reader will readily apprehend what a plausible case can be made out
for the inclusion of these items of damage, if only on sentimental
grounds. It can be pointed out, first of all, that from the point of
view of general fairness it is monstrous that a woman whose house is
destroyed should be entitled to claim from the enemy whilst a woman
whose husband is killed on the field of battle should not be so
entitled; or that a farmer deprived of his farm should claim but that a
woman deprived of the earning power of her husband should not claim. In
fact the case for including Pensions and Separation Allowances largely
depends on exploiting the rather _arbitrary_ character of the criterion
laid down in the pre-Armistice conditions. Of all the losses caused by
war some bear more heavily on individuals and some are more evenly
distributed over the community as a whole; but by means of compensations
granted by the Government many of the former are in fact converted into
the latter. The most logical criterion for a limited claim, falling
short of the entire costs of the war, would have been in respect of
enemy acts contrary to International engagements or the recognized
practices of warfare. But this also would have been very difficult to
apply and unduly unfavorable to French interests as compared with
Belgium (whose neutrality Germany had guaranteed) and Great Britain (the
chief sufferer from illicit acts of submarines).

In any case the appeals to sentiment and fairness outlined above are
hollow; for it makes no difference to the recipient of a separation
allowance or a pension whether the State which pays them receives
compensation on this or on another head, and a recovery by the State out
of indemnity receipts is just as much in relief of the general taxpayer
as a contribution towards the general costs of the war would have been.
But the main consideration is that it was too late to consider whether
the pre-Armistice conditions were perfectly judicious and logical or to
amend them; the only question at issue was whether these conditions were
not in fact limited to such classes of direct damage to civilians and
their property as are set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of
Annex I. If words have any meaning, or engagements any force, we had no
more right to claim for those war expenses of the State, which arose out
of Pensions and Separation Allowances, than for any other of the general
costs of the war. And who is prepared to argue in detail that we were
entitled to demand the latter?

What had really happened was a compromise between the Prime Minister's
pledge to the British electorate to claim the entire costs of the war
and the pledge to the contrary which the Allies had given to Germany at
the Armistice. The Prime Minister could claim that although he had not
secured the entire costs of the war, he had nevertheless secured an
important contribution towards them, that he had always qualified his
promises by the limiting condition of Germany's capacity to pay, and
that the bill as now presented more than exhausted this capacity as
estimated by the more sober authorities. The President, on the other
hand, had secured a formula, which was not too obvious a breach of
faith, and had avoided a quarrel with his Associates on an issue where
the appeals to sentiment and passion would all have been against him, in
the event of its being made a matter of open popular controversy. In
view of the Prime Minister's election pledges, the President could
hardly hope to get him to abandon them in their entirety without a
struggle in public; and the cry of pensions would have had an
overwhelming popular appeal in all countries. Once more the Prime
Minister had shown himself a political tactician of a high order.

A further point of great difficulty may be readily perceived between the
lines of the Treaty. It fixes no definite sum as representing Germany's
liability. This feature has been the subject of very general
criticism,--that it is equally inconvenient to Germany and to the Allies
themselves that she should not know what she has to pay or they what
they are to receive. The method, apparently contemplated by the Treaty,
of arriving at the final result over a period of many months by an
addition of hundreds of thousands of individual claims for damage to
land, farm buildings, and chickens, is evidently impracticable; and the
reasonable course would have been for both parties to compound for a
round sum without examination of details. If this round sum had been
named in the Treaty, the settlement would have been placed on a more
business-like basis.

But this was impossible for two reasons. Two different kinds of false
statements had been widely promulgated, one as to Germany's capacity to
pay, the other as to the amount of the Allies' just claims in respect of
the devastated areas. The fixing of either of these figures presented a
dilemma. A figure for Germany's prospective capacity to pay, not too
much in excess of the estimates of most candid and well-informed
authorities, would have fallen hopelessly far short of popular
expectations both in England and in France. On the other hand, a
definitive figure for damage done which would not disastrously
disappoint the expectations which had been raised in France and Belgium
might have been incapable of substantiation under challenge,[105] and
open to damaging criticism on the part of the Germans, who were believed
to have been prudent enough to accumulate considerable evidence as to
the extent of their own misdoings.

By far the safest course for the politicians was, therefore, to mention
no figure at all; and from this necessity a great deal of the
complication of the Reparation Chapter essentially springs.

The reader may be interested, however, to have my estimate of the claim
which can in fact be substantiated under Annex I. of the Reparation
Chapter. In the first section of this chapter I have already guessed the
claims other than those for Pensions and Separation Allowances at
$15,000,000,000 (to take the extreme upper limit of my estimate). The
claim for Pensions and Separation Allowances under Annex I. is not to be
based on the _actual_ cost of these compensations to the Governments
concerned, but is to be a computed figure calculated on the basis of the
scales in force in France at the date of the Treaty's coming into
operation. This method avoids the invidious course of valuing an
American or a British life at a higher figure than a French or an
Italian. The French rate for Pensions and Allowances is at an
intermediate rate, not so high as the American or British, but above the
Italian, the Belgian, or the Serbian. The only data required for the
calculation are the actual French rates and the numbers of men mobilized
and of the casualties in each class of the various Allied Armies. None
of these figures are available in detail, but enough is known of the
general level of allowances, of the numbers involved, and of the
casualties suffered to allow of an estimate which may not be _very wide_
of the mark. My guess as to the amount to be added in respect of
Pensions and Allowances is as follows:

    British Empire                 $ 7,000,000,000[106]
    France                          12,000,000,000[106]
    Italy                            2,500,000,000
    Others (including United States) 3,500,000,000
                                   ---------------
    Total                         $ 25,000,000,000

I feel much more confidence in the approximate accuracy of the total
figure[107] than in its division between the different claimants. The
reader will observe that in any case the addition of Pensions and
Allowances enormously increases the aggregate claim, raising it indeed
by nearly double. Adding this figure to the estimate under other heads,
we have a total claim against Germany of $40,000,000,000.[108] I believe
that this figure is fully high enough, and that the actual result may
fall somewhat short of it.[109] In the next section of this chapter the
relation of this figure to Germany's capacity to pay will be examined.
It is only necessary here to remind the reader of certain other
particulars of the Treaty which speak for themselves:

1. Out of the total amount of the claim, whatever it eventually turns
out to be, a sum of $5,000,000,000 must be paid before May 1, 1921. The
possibility of this will be discussed below. But the Treaty itself
provides certain abatements. In the first place, this sum is to include
the expenses of the Armies of Occupation since the Armistice (a large
charge of the order of magnitude of $1,000,000,000 which under another
Article of the Treaty--No. 249--is laid upon Germany).[110] But further,
"such supplies of food and raw materials as may be judged by the
Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to be
essential to enable Germany to meet her obligations for Reparation may
also, with the approval of the said Governments, be paid for out of the
above sum."[111] This is a qualification of high importance. The clause,
as it is drafted, allows the Finance Ministers of the Allied countries
to hold out to their electorates the hope of substantial payments at an
early date, while at the same time it gives to the Reparation Commission
a discretion, which the force of facts will compel them to exercise, to
give back to Germany what is required for the maintenance of her
economic existence. This discretionary power renders the demand for an
immediate payment of $5,000,000,000 less injurious than it would
otherwise be, but nevertheless it does not render it innocuous. In the
first place, my conclusions in the next section of this chapter indicate
that this sum cannot be found within the period indicated, even if a
large proportion is in practice returned to Germany for the purpose of
enabling her to pay for imports. In the second place, the Reparation
Commission can only exercise its discretionary power effectively by
taking charge of the entire foreign trade of Germany, together with the
foreign exchange arising out of it, which will be quite beyond the
capacity of any such body. If the Reparation Commission makes any
serious attempt to administer the collection of this sum of
$5,000,000,000 and to authorize the return to Germany of a part it, the
trade of Central Europe will be strangled by bureaucratic regulation in
its most inefficient form.

2. In addition to the early payment in cash or kind of a sum of
$5,000,000,000, Germany is required to deliver bearer bonds to a further
amount of $10,000,000,000, or, in the event of the payments in cash or
kind before May 1, 1921, available for Reparation, falling short of
$5,000,000,000 by reason of the permitted deductions, to such further
amount as shall bring the total payments by Germany in cash, kind, and
bearer bonds up to May 1, 1921, to a figure of $15,000,000,000
altogether.[112] These bearer bonds carry interest at 2-1/2 per cent per
annum from 1921 to 1925, and at 5 per cent _plus_ 1 per cent for
amortization thereafter. Assuming, therefore, that Germany is not able
to provide any appreciable surplus towards Reparation before 1921, she
will have to find a sum of $375,000,000 annually from 1921 to 1925, and
$900,000,000 annually thereafter.[113]

3. As soon as the Reparation Commission is satisfied that Germany can do
better than this, 5 per cent bearer bonds are to be issued for a further
$10,000,000,000, the rate of amortization being determined by the
Commission hereafter. This would bring the annual payment to
$1,400,000,000 without allowing anything for the discharge of the
capital of the last $10,000,000,000.

4. Germany's liability, however, is not limited to $25,000,000,000, and
the Reparation Commission is to demand further instalments of bearer
bonds until the total enemy liability under Annex I. has been provided
for. On the basis of my estimate of $40,000,000,000 for the total
liability, which is more likely to be criticized as being too low than
as being too high, the amount of this balance will be $15,000,000,000.
Assuming interest at 5 per cent, this will raise the annual payment to
$2,150,000,000 without allowance for amortization.

5. But even this is not all. There is a further provision of devastating
significance. Bonds representing payments in excess of $15,000,000,000
are not to be issued until the Commission is satisfied that Germany can
meet the interest on them. But this does not mean that interest is
remitted in the meantime. As from May 1, 1921, interest is to be debited
to Germany on such part of her outstanding debt as has not been covered
by payment in cash or kind or by the issue of bonds as above,[114] and
"the rate of interest shall be 5 per cent unless the Commission shall
determine at some future time that circumstances justify a variation of
this rate." That is to say, the capital sum of indebtedness is rolling
up all the time at compound interest. The effect of this provision
towards increasing the burden is, on the assumption that Germany cannot
pay very large sums at first, enormous. At 5 per cent compound interest
a capital sum doubles itself in fifteen years. On the assumption that
Germany cannot pay more than $750,000,000 annually until 1936 (_i.e._ 5
per cent interest on $15,000,000,000) the $25,000,000,000 on which
interest is deferred will have risen to $50,000,000,000, carrying an
annual interest charge of $2,500,000,000. That is to say, even if
Germany pays $750,000,000 annually up to 1936, she will nevertheless owe
us at that date more than half as much again as she does now
($65,000,000,000 as compared with $40,000,000,000). From 1936 onwards
she will have to pay to us $3,250,000,000 annually in order to keep pace
with the interest alone. At the end of any year in which she pays less
than this sum she will owe more than she did at the beginning of it. And
if she is to discharge the capital sum in thirty years from 1930, _i.e._
in forty-eight years from the Armistice, she must pay an additional
$650,000,000 annually, making $3,900,000,000 in all.[115]

It is, in my judgment, as certain as anything can be, for reasons which
I will elaborate in a moment, that Germany cannot pay anything
approaching this sum. Until the Treaty is altered, therefore, Germany
has in effect engaged herself to hand over to the Allies the whole of
her surplus production in perpetuity.

6. This is not less the case because the Reparation Commission has been
given discretionary powers to vary the rate of interest, and to postpone
and even to cancel the capital indebtedness. In the first place, some of
these powers can only be exercised if the Commission or the Governments
represented on it are _unanimous_.[116] But also, which is perhaps more
important, it will be the _duty_ of the Reparation Commission, until
there has been a unanimous and far-reaching change of the policy which
the Treaty represents, to extract from Germany year after year the
maximum sum obtainable. There is a great difference between fixing a
definite sum, which though large is within Germany's capacity to pay and
yet to retain a little for herself, and fixing a sum far beyond her
capacity, which is then to be reduced at the discretion of a foreign
Commission acting with the object of obtaining each year the maximum
which the circumstances of that year permit. The first still leaves her
with some slight incentive for enterprise, energy, and hope. The latter
skins her alive year by year in perpetuity, and however skilfully and
discreetly the operation is performed, with whatever regard for not
killing the patient in the process, it would represent a policy which,
if it were really entertained and deliberately practised, the judgment
of men would soon pronounce to be one of the most outrageous acts of a
cruel victor in civilized history.

There are other functions and powers of high significance which the
Treaty accords to the Reparation Commission. But these will be most
conveniently dealt with in a separate section.


III. _Germany's Capacity to pay_

The forms in which Germany can discharge the sum which she has engaged
herself to pay are three in number--

1. Immediately transferable wealth in the form of gold, ships, and
foreign securities;

2. The value of property in ceded territory, or surrendered under the
Armistice;

3. Annual payments spread over a term of years, partly in cash and
partly in materials such as coal products, potash, and dyes.

There is excluded from the above the actual restitution of property
removed from territory occupied by the enemy, as, for example, Russian
gold, Belgian and French securities, cattle, machinery, and works of
art. In so far as the actual goods taken can be identified and restored,
they must clearly be returned to their rightful owners, and cannot be
brought into the general reparation pool. This is expressly provided for
in Article 238 of the Treaty.


1. _Immediately Transferable Wealth_

(_a_) _Gold_.--After deduction of the gold to be returned to Russia, the
official holding of gold as shown in the Reichsbank's return of the 30th
November, 1918, amounted to $577,089,500. This was a very much larger
amount than had appeared in the Reichsbank's return prior to the
war,[117] and was the result of the vigorous campaign carried on in
Germany during the war for the surrender to the Reichsbank not only of
gold coin but of gold ornaments of every kind. Private hoards doubtless
still exist, but, in view of the great efforts already made, it is
unlikely that either the German Government or the Allies will be able to
unearth them. The return can therefore be taken as probably representing
the maximum amount which the German Government are able to extract from
their people. In addition to gold there was in the Reichsbank a sum of
about $5,000,000 in silver. There must be, however, a further
substantial amount in circulation, for the holdings of the Reichsbank
were as high as $45,500,000 on the 31st December, 1917, and stood at
about $30,000,000 up to the latter part of October, 1918, when the
internal run began on currency of every kind.[118] We may, therefore,
take a total of (say) $625,000,000 for gold and silver together at the
date of the Armistice.

These reserves, however, are no longer intact. During the long period
which elapsed between the Armistice and the Peace it became necessary
for the Allies to facilitate the provisioning of Germany from abroad.
The political condition of Germany at that time and the serious menace
of Spartacism rendered this step necessary in the interests of the
Allies themselves if they desired the continuance in Germany of a stable
Government to treat with. The question of how such provisions were to be
paid for presented, however, the gravest difficulties. A series of
Conferences was held at TrËves, at Spa, at Brussels, and subsequently at
Ch‚teau Villette and Versailles, between representatives of the Allies
and of Germany, with the object of finding some method of payment as
little injurious as possible to the future prospects of Reparation
payments. The German representatives maintained from the outset that the
financial exhaustion of their country was for the time being so complete
that a temporary loan from the Allies was the only possible expedient.
This the Allies could hardly admit at a time when they were preparing
demands for the immediate payment by Germany of immeasurably larger
sums. But, apart from this, the German claim could not be accepted as
strictly accurate so long as their gold was still untapped and their
remaining foreign securities unmarketed. In any case, it was out of the
question to suppose that in the spring of 1919 public opinion in the
Allied countries or in America would have allowed the grant of a
substantial loan to Germany. On the other hand, the Allies were
naturally reluctant to exhaust on the provisioning of Germany the gold
which seemed to afford one of the few obvious and certain sources for
Reparation. Much time was expended in the exploration of all possible
alternatives; but it was evident at last that, even if German exports
and saleable foreign securities had been available to a sufficient
value, they could not be liquidated in time, and that the financial
exhaustion of Germany was so complete that nothing whatever was
immediately available in substantial amounts except the gold in the
Reichsbank. Accordingly a sum exceeding $250,000,000 in all out of the
Reichsbank gold was transferred by Germany to the Allies (chiefly to the
United States, Great Britain, however, also receiving a substantial sum)
during the first six months of 1919 in payment for foodstuffs.

But this was not all. Although Germany agreed, under the first extension
of the Armistice, not to export gold without Allied permission, this
permission could not be always withheld. There were liabilities of the
Reichsbank accruing in the neighboring neutral countries, which could
not be met otherwise than in gold. The failure of the Reichsbank to meet
its liabilities would have caused a depreciation of the exchange so
injurious to Germany's credit as to react on the future prospects of
Reparation. In some cases, therefore, permission to export gold was
accorded to the Reichsbank by the Supreme Economic Council of the
Allies.

The net result of these various measures was to reduce the gold reserve
of the Reichsbank by more than half, the figures falling from
$575,000,000 to $275,000,000 in September, 1919.

It would be _possible_ under the Treaty to take the whole of this latter
sum for Reparation purposes. It amounts, however, as it is, to less
than 4 per cent of the Reichsbank's Note Issue, and the psychological
effect of its total confiscation might be expected (having regard to the
very large volume of mark notes held abroad) to destroy the exchange
value of the mark almost entirely. A sum of $25,000,000, $50,000,000, or
even $100,000,000 might be taken for a special purpose. But we may
assume that the Reparation Commission will judge it imprudent, having
regard to the reaction on their future prospects of securing payment, to
ruin the German currency system altogether, more particularly because
the French and Belgian Governments, being holders of a very large volume
of mark notes formerly circulating in the occupied or ceded territory,
have a great interest in maintaining some exchange value for the mark,
quite apart from Reparation prospects.

It follows, therefore, that no sum worth speaking of can be expected in
the form of gold or silver towards the initial payment of $5,000,000,000
due by 1921.

(_b_) _Shipping_.--Germany has engaged, as we have seen above, to
surrender to the Allies virtually the whole of her merchant shipping. A
considerable part of it, indeed, was already in the hands of the Allies
prior to the conclusion of Peace, either by detention in their ports or
by the provisional transfer of tonnage under the Brussels Agreement in
connection with the supply of foodstuffs.[119] Estimating the tonnage of
German shipping to be taken over under the Treaty at 4,000,000 gross
tons, and the average value per ton at $150 per ton, the total money
value involved is $600,000,000.[120]

(_c_) _Foreign Securities_.--Prior to the census of foreign securities
carried out by the German Government in September, 1916,[121] of which
the exact results have not been made public, no official return of such
investments was ever called for in Germany, and the various unofficial
estimates are confessedly based on insufficient data, such as the
admission of foreign securities to the German Stock Exchanges, the
receipts of the stamp duties, consular reports, etc. The principal
German estimates current before the war are given in the appended
footnote.[122] This shows a general consensus of opinion among German
authorities that their net foreign investments were upwards of
$6,250,000,000. I take this figure as the basis of my calculations,
although I believe it to be an exaggeration; $5,000,000,000 would
probably be a safer figure.

Deductions from this aggregate total have to be made under four heads.

(i.) Investments in Allied countries and in the United States, which
between them constitute a considerable part of the world, have been
sequestrated by Public Trustees, Custodians of Enemy Property, and
similar officials, and are not available for Reparation except in so far
as they show a surplus over various private claims. Under the scheme for
dealing with enemy debts outlined in Chapter IV., the first charge on
these assets is the private claims of Allied against German nationals.
It is unlikely, except in the United States, that there will be any
appreciable surplus for any other purpose.

(ii.) Germany's most important fields of foreign investment before the
war were not, like ours, oversea, but in Russia, Austria-Hungary,
Turkey, Roumania, and Bulgaria. A great part of these has now become
almost valueless, at any rate for the time being; especially those in
Russia and Austria-Hungary. If present market value is to be taken as
the test, none of these investments are now saleable above a nominal
figure. Unless the Allies are prepared to take over these securities
much above their nominal market valuation, and hold them for future
realization, there is no substantial source of funds for immediate
payment in the form of investments in these countries.

(iii.) While Germany was not in a position to realize her foreign
investments during the war to the degree that we were, she did so
nevertheless in the case of certain countries and to the extent that
she was able. Before the United States came into the war, she is
believed to have resold a large part of the pick of her investments in
American securities, although some current estimates of these sales (a
figure of $300,000,000 has been mentioned) are probably exaggerated. But
throughout the war and particularly in its later stages, when her
exchanges were weak and her credit in the neighboring neutral countries
was becoming very low, she was disposing of such securities as Holland,
Switzerland, and Scandinavia would buy or would accept as collateral. It
is reasonably certain that by June, 1919, her investments in these
countries had been reduced to a negligible figure and were far exceeded
by her liabilities in them. Germany has also sold certain overseas
securities, such as Argentine cedulas, for which a market could be
found.

(iv.) It is certain that since the Armistice there has been a great
flight abroad of the foreign securities still remaining in private
hands. This is exceedingly difficult to prevent. German foreign
investments are as a rule in the form of bearer securities and are not
registered. They are easily smuggled abroad across Germany's extensive
land frontiers, and for some months before the conclusion of peace it
was certain that their owners would not be allowed to retain them if the
Allied Governments could discover any method of getting hold of them.
These factors combined to stimulate human ingenuity, and the efforts
both of the Allied and of the German Governments to interfere
effectively with the outflow are believed to have been largely futile.

In face of all these considerations, it will be a miracle if much
remains for Reparation. The countries of the Allies and of the United
States, the countries of Germany's own allies, and the neutral countries
adjacent to Germany exhaust between them almost the whole of the
civilized world; and, as we have seen, we cannot expect much to be
available for Reparation from investments in any of these quarters.
Indeed there remain no countries of importance for investments except
those of South America.

To convert the significance of these deductions into figures involves
much guesswork. I give the reader the best personal estimate I can form
after pondering the matter in the light of the available figures and
other relevant data.

I put the deduction under (i.) at $1,500,000,000, of which $500,000,000
may be ultimately available after meeting private debts, etc.

As regards (ii.)--according to a census taken by the Austrian Ministry
of Finance on the 31st December, 1912, the nominal value of the
Austro-Hungarian securities held by Germans was $986,500,000. Germany's
pre-war investments in Russia outside Government securities have been
estimated at $475,000,000, which is much lower than would be expected,
and in 1906 Sartorius v. Waltershausen estimated her investments in
Russian Government securities at $750,000,000. This gives a total of
$1,225,000,000, which is to some extent borne out by the figure of
$1,000,000,000 given in 1911 by Dr. Ischchanian as a deliberately modest
estimate. A Roumanian estimate, published at the time of that country's
entry in the war, gave the value of Germany's investments in Roumania at
$20,000,000 to $22,000,000, of which $14,000,000 to $16,000,000 were in
Government securities. An association for the defense of French
interests in Turkey, as reported in the _Temps_ (Sept. 8, 1919), has
estimated the total amount of German capital invested in Turkey at about
$295,000,000, of which, according to the latest Report of the Council of
Foreign Bondholders, $162,500,000 was held by German nationals in the
Turkish External Debt. No estimates are available to me of Germany's
investments in Bulgaria. Altogether I venture a deduction of
$2,500,000,000 in respect of this group of countries as a whole.

Resales and the pledging as collateral of securities during the war
under (iii.) I put at $500,000,000 to $750,000,000, comprising
practically all Germany's holding of Scandinavian, Dutch, and Swiss
securities, a part of her South American securities, and a substantial
proportion of her North American securities sold prior to the entry of
the United States into the war.

As to the proper deduction under (iv.) there are naturally no available
figures. For months past the European press has been full of sensational
stories of the expedients adopted. But if we put the value of securities
which have already left Germany or have been safely secreted within
Germany itself beyond discovery by the most inquisitorial and powerful
methods at $500,000,000, we are not likely to overstate it.

These various items lead, therefore, in all to a deduction of a round
figure of about $5,000,000,000, and leave us with an amount of
$1,250,000,000 theoretically still available.[123]

To some readers this figure may seem low, but let them remember that it
purports to represent the remnant of _saleable_ securities upon which
the German Government might be able to lay hands for public purposes. In
my own opinion it is much too high, and considering the problem by a
different method of attack I arrive at a lower figure. For leaving out
of account sequestered Allied securities and investments in Austria,
Russia, etc., what blocks of securities, specified by countries and
enterprises, can Germany possibly still have which could amount to as
much as $1,250,000,000? I cannot answer the question. She has some
Chinese Government securities which have not been sequestered, a few
Japanese perhaps, and a more substantial value of first-class South
American properties. But there are very few enterprises of this class
still in German hands, and even _their_ value is measured by one or two
tens of millions, not by fifties or hundreds. He would be a rash man, in
my judgment, who joined a syndicate to pay $500,000,000 in cash for the
unsequestered remnant of Germany's overseas investments. If the
Reparation Commission is to realize even this lower figure, it is
probable that they will have to nurse, for some years, the assets which
they take over, not attempting their disposal at the present time.

We have, therefore, a figure of from $500,000,000 to $1,250,000,000 as
the maximum contribution from Germany's foreign securities.

Her immediately transferable wealth is composed, then, of--

(_a_) Gold and silver--say $300,000,000.

(_b_) Ships--$600,000,000.

(_c_) Foreign securities--$500,000,000 to $1,250,000,000.

Of the gold and silver, it is not, in fact, practicable to take any
substantial part without consequences to the German currency system
injurious to the interests of the Allies themselves. The contribution
from all these sources together which the Reparation Commission can hope
to secure by May, 1921, may be put, therefore, at from $1,250,000,000 to
$1,750,000,000 _as a maximum_.[124]


2. _Property in ceded Territory or surrendered under the Armistice_

As the Treaty has been drafted Germany will not receive important
credits available towards meeting reparation in respect of her property
in ceded territory.

_Private_ property in most of the ceded territory is utilized towards
discharging private German debts to Allied nationals, and only the
surplus, if any, is available towards Reparation. The value of such
property in Poland and the other new States is payable direct to the
owners.

_Government_ property in Alsace-Lorraine, in territory ceded to Belgium,
and in Germany's former colonies transferred to a Mandatory, is to be
forfeited without credit given. Buildings, forests, and other State
property which belonged to the former Kingdom of Poland are also to be
surrendered without credit. There remain, therefore, Government
properties, other than the above, surrendered to Poland, Government
properties in Schleswig surrendered to Denmark,[125] the value of the
Saar coalfields, the value of certain river craft, etc., to be
surrendered under the Ports, Waterways, and Railways Chapter, and the
value of the German submarine cables transferred under Annex VII. of the
Reparation Chapter.

Whatever the Treaty may say, the Reparation Commission will not secure
any cash payments from Poland. I believe that the Saar coalfields have
been valued at from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000. A round figure of
$150,000,000 for all the above items, excluding any surplus available in
respect of private property, is probably a liberal estimate.

Then remains the value of material surrendered under the Armistice.
Article 250 provides that a credit shall be assessed by the Reparation
Commission for rolling-stock surrendered under the Armistice as well as
for certain other specified items, and generally for any material so
surrendered for which the Reparation Commission think that credit should
be given, "as having non-military value." The rolling-stock (150,000
wagons and 5,000 locomotives) is the only very valuable item. A round
figure of $250,000,000, for all the Armistice surrenders, is probably
again a liberal estimate.

We have, therefore, $400,000,000 to add in respect of this heading to
our figure of $1,250,000,000 to $1,750,000,000 under the previous
heading. This figure differs from the preceding in that it does not
represent cash capable of benefiting the financial situation of the
Allies, but is only a book credit between themselves or between them and
Germany.

The total of $1,650,000,000 to $2,150,000,000 now reached is not,
however, available for Reparation. The _first_ charge upon it, under
Article 251 of the Treaty, is the cost of the Armies of Occupation both
during the Armistice and after the conclusion of Peace. The aggregate of
this figure up to May, 1921, cannot be calculated until the rate of
withdrawal is known which is to reduce the _monthly_ cost from the
figure exceeding $100,000,000, which prevailed during the first part of
1919, to that of $5,000,000, which is to be the normal figure
eventually. I estimate, however, that this aggregate may be about
$1,000,000,000. This leaves us with from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000
still in hand.

Out of this, and out of exports of goods, and payments in kind under the
Treaty prior to May, 1921 (for which I have not as yet made any
allowance), the Allies have held out the hope that they will allow
Germany to receive back such sums for the purchase of necessary food and
raw materials as the former deem it essential for her to have. It is not
possible at the present time to form an accurate judgment either as to
the money-value of the goods which Germany will require to purchase from
abroad in order to re-establish her economic life, or as to the degree
of liberality with which the Allies will exercise their discretion. If
her stocks of raw materials and food were to be restored to anything
approaching their normal level by May, 1921, Germany would probably
require foreign purchasing power of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000
at least, in addition to the value of her current exports. While this is
not likely to be permitted, I venture to assert as a matter beyond
reasonable dispute that the social and economic condition of Germany
cannot possibly permit a surplus of exports over imports during the
period prior to May, 1921, and that the value of any payments in kind
with which she may be able to furnish the Allies under the Treaty in the
form of coal, dyes, timber, or other materials will have to be returned
to her to enable her to pay for imports essential to her existence.[126]

The Reparation Commission can, therefore, expect no addition from other
sources to the sum of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 with which we
have hypothetically credited it after the realization of Germany's
immediately transferable wealth, the calculation of the credits due to
Germany under the Treaty, and the discharge of the cost of the Armies of
Occupation. As Belgium has secured a private agreement with France, the
United States, and Great Britain, outside the Treaty, by which she is to
receive, towards satisfaction of her claims, the _first_ $500,000,000
available for Reparation, the upshot of the whole matter is that Belgium
may _possibly_ get her $500,000,000 by May, 1921, but none of the other
Allies are likely to secure by that date any contribution worth speaking
of. At any rate, it would be very imprudent for Finance Ministers to lay
their plans on any other hypothesis.

3. _Annual Payments spread over a Term of Years_

It is evident that Germany's pre-war capacity to pay an annual foreign
tribute has not been unaffected by the almost total loss of her
colonies, her overseas connections, her mercantile marine, and her
foreign properties, by the cession of ten per cent of her territory and
population, of one-third of her coal and of three-quarters of her iron
ore, by two million casualties amongst men in the prime of life, by the
starvation of her people for four years, by the burden of a vast war
debt, by the depreciation of her currency to less than one-seventh its
former value, by the disruption of her allies and their territories, by
Revolution at home and Bolshevism on her borders, and by all the
unmeasured ruin in strength and hope of four years of all-swallowing war
and final defeat.

All this, one would have supposed, is evident. Yet most estimates of a
great indemnity from Germany depend on the assumption that she is in a
position to conduct in the future a vastly greater trade than ever she
has had in the past.

For the purpose of arriving at a figure it is of no great consequence
whether payment takes the form of cash (or rather of foreign exchange)
or is partly effected in kind (coal, dyes, timber, etc.), as
contemplated by the Treaty. In any event, it is only by the export of
specific commodities that Germany can pay, and the method of turning the
value of these exports to account for Reparation purposes is,
comparatively, a matter of detail.

We shall lose ourselves in mere hypothesis unless we return in some
degree to first principles, and, whenever we can, to such statistics as
there are. It is certain that an annual payment can only be made by
Germany over a series of years by diminishing her imports and increasing
her exports, thus enlarging the balance in her favor which is available
for effecting payments abroad. Germany can pay in the long-run in goods,
and in goods only, whether these goods are furnished direct to the
Allies, or whether they are sold to neutrals and the neutral credits so
arising are then made over to the Allies. The most solid basis for
estimating the extent to which this process can be carried is to be
found, therefore, in an analysis of her trade returns before the war.
Only on the basis of such an analysis, supplemented by some general data
as to the aggregate wealth-producing capacity of the country, can a
rational guess be made as to the maximum degree to which the exports of
Germany could be brought to exceed her imports.

In the year 1913 Germany's imports amounted to $2,690,000,000, and her
exports to $2,525,000,000, exclusive of transit trade and bullion. That
is to say, imports exceeded exports by about $165,000,000. On the
average of the five years ending 1913, however, her imports exceeded her
exports by a substantially larger amount, namely, $370,000,000. It
follows, therefore, that more than the whole of Germany's pre-war
balance for new foreign investment was derived from the interest on her
existing foreign securities, and from the profits of her shipping,
foreign banking, etc. As her foreign properties and her mercantile
marine are now to be taken from her, and as her foreign banking and
other miscellaneous sources of revenue from abroad have been largely
destroyed, it appears that, on the pre-war basis of exports and imports,
Germany, so far from having a surplus wherewith to make a foreign
payment, would be not nearly self-supporting. Her first task, therefore,
must be to effect a readjustment of consumption and production to cover
this deficit. Any further economy she can effect in the use of imported
commodities, and any further stimulation of exports will then be
available for Reparation.

Two-thirds of Germany's import and export trade is enumerated under
separate headings in the following tables. The considerations applying
to the enumerated portions may be assumed to apply more or less to the
remaining one-third, which is composed of commodities of minor
importance individually.

These tables show that the most important exports consisted of:--

    (1) Iron goods, including tin plates (13.2 per cent),
    (2) Machinery, etc. (7.5 per cent),
    (3) Coal, coke, and briquettes (7 per cent),
    (4) Woolen goods, including raw and combed wool (5.9 per
        cent), and
    (5) Cotton goods, including cotton yarn and thread and raw
        cotton (5.6 per cent),

these five classes between them accounting for 39.2 per cent. of the
total exports. It will be observed that all these goods are of a kind in
which before the war competition between Germany and the United Kingdom
was very severe. If, therefore, the volume of such exports to overseas
or European destinations is very largely increased the effect upon
British export trade must be correspondingly serious. As regards two of
the categories, namely, cotton and woolen goods, the increase of an
export trade is dependent upon an increase of the import of the raw
material, since Germany produces no cotton and practically no wool.
These trades are therefore incapable of expansion unless Germany is
given facilities for securing these raw materials (which can only be at
the expense of the Allies) in excess of the pre-war standard of
consumption, and even then the effective increase is not the gross value
of the exports, but only the difference between the value of the
manufactured exports and of the imported raw material. As regards the
other three categories, namely, machinery, iron goods, and coal,
Germany's capacity to increase her exports will have been taken from her
by the cessions of territory in Poland, Upper Silesia, and
Alsace-Lorraine. As has been pointed out already, these districts
accounted for nearly one-third of Germany's production of coal. But they
also supplied no less than three-quarters of her iron-ore production, 38
per cent of her blast furnaces, and 9.5 per cent of her iron and steel
foundries. Unless, therefore, Alsace-Lorraine and Upper Silesia send
their iron ore to Germany proper, to be worked up, which will involve an
increase in the imports for which she will have to find payment, so far
from any increase in export trade being possible, a decrease is
inevitable.[127]

Next on the list come cereals, leather goods, sugar, paper, furs,
electrical goods, silk goods, and dyes. Cereals are not a net export and
are far more than balanced by imports of the same commodities. As
regards sugar, nearly 90 per cent of Germany's pre-war exports came to
the United Kingdom.[128] An increase in this trade might be stimulated
by a grant of a preference in this country to German sugar or by an
arrangement by which sugar was taken in part payment for the indemnity
on the same lines as has been proposed for coal, dyes, etc. Paper
exports also might be capable of some increase. Leather goods, furs, and
silks depend upon corresponding imports on the other side of the
account. Silk goods are largely in competition with the trade of France
and Italy. The remaining items are individually very small. I have heard
it suggested that the indemnity might be paid to a great extent in
potash and the like. But potash before the war represented 0.6 per cent
of Germany's export trade, and about $15,000,000 in aggregate value.
Besides, France, having secured a potash field in the territory which
has been restored to her, will not welcome a great stimulation of the
German exports of this material.

An examination of the import list shows that 63.6 per cent are raw
materials and food. The chief items of the former class, namely, cotton,
wool, copper, hides, iron-ore, furs, silk, rubber, and tin, could not be
much reduced without reacting on the export trade, and might have to be
increased if the export trade was to be increased. Imports of food,
namely, wheat, barley, coffee, eggs, rice, maize, and the like, present
a different problem. It is unlikely that, apart from certain comforts,
the consumption of food by the German laboring classes before the war
was in excess of what was required for maximum efficiency; indeed, it
probably fell short of that amount. Any substantial decrease in the
imports of food would therefore react on the efficiency of the
industrial population, and consequently on the volume of surplus exports
which they could be forced to produce. It is hardly possible to insist
on a greatly increased productivity of German industry if the workmen
are to be underfed. But this may not be equally true of barley, coffee,
eggs, and tobacco. If it were possible to enforce a rÈgime in which for
the future no German drank beer or coffee, or smoked any tobacco, a
substantial saving could be effected. Otherwise there seems little room
for any significant reduction.

The following analysis of German exports and imports, according to
destination and origin, is also relevant. From this it appears that of
Germany's exports in 1913, 18 per cent went to the British Empire, 17
per cent to France, Italy, and Belgium, 10 per cent to Russia and
Roumania, and 7 per cent to the United States; that is to say, more than
half of the exports found their market in the countries of the Entente
nations. Of the balance, 12 per cent went to Austria-Hungary, Turkey,
and Bulgaria, and 35 per cent elsewhere. Unless, therefore, the present
Allies are prepared to encourage the importation of German products, a
substantial increase in total volume can only be effected by the
wholesale swamping of neutral markets.

The above analysis affords some indication of the possible magnitude of
the maximum modification of Germany's export balance under the
conditions which will prevail after the Peace. On the assumptions (1)
that we do not specially favor Germany over ourselves in supplies of
such raw materials as cotton and wool (the world's supply of which is
limited), (2) that France, having secured the iron-ore deposits, makes a
serious attempt to secure the blast-furnaces and the steel trade also,
(3) that Germany is not encouraged and assisted to undercut the iron and
other trades of the Allies in overseas market, and (4) that a
substantial preference is not given to German goods in the British
Empire, it is evident by examination of the specific items that not much
is practicable.

Let us run over the chief items again: (1) Iron goods. In view of
Germany's loss of resources, an increased net export seems impossible
and a large decrease probable. (2) Machinery. Some increase is possible.
(3) Coal and coke. The value of Germany's net export before the war was
$110,000,000; the Allies have agreed that for the time being 20,000,000
tons is the maximum possible export with a problematic (and in fact)
impossible increase to 40,000,000 tons at some future time; even on the
basis of 20,000,000 tons we have virtually no increase of value,
measured in pre-war prices;[129] whilst, if this amount is exacted,
there must be a decrease of far greater value in the export of
manufactured articles requiring coal for their production. (4) Woolen
goods. An increase is impossible without the raw wool, and, having
regard to the other claims on supplies of raw wool, a decrease is
likely. (5) Cotton goods. The same considerations apply as to wool. (6)
Cereals. There never was and never can be a net export. (7) Leather
goods. The same considerations apply as to wool.

We have now covered nearly half of Germany's pre-war exports, and there
is no other commodity which formerly represented as much as 3 per cent
of her exports. In what commodity is she to pay? Dyes?--their total
value in 1913 was $50,000,000. Toys? Potash?--1913 exports were worth
$15,000,000. And even if the commodities could be specified, in what
markets are they to be sold?--remembering that we have in mind goods to
the value not of tens of millions annually, but of hundreds of millions.

On the side of imports, rather more is possible. By lowering the
standard of life, an appreciable reduction of expenditure on imported
commodities may be possible. But, as we have already seen, many large
items are incapable of reduction without reacting on the volume of
exports.

Let us put our guess as high as we can without being foolish, and
suppose that after a time Germany will be able, in spite of the
reduction of her resources, her facilities, her markets, and her
productive power, to increase her exports and diminish her imports so as
to improve her trade balance altogether by $500,000,000 annually,
measured in pre-war prices. This adjustment is first required to
liquidate the adverse trade balance, which in the five years before the
war averaged $370,000,000; but we will assume that after allowing for
this, she is left with a favorable trade balance of $250,000,000 a year.
Doubling this to allow for the rise in pre-war prices, we have a figure
of $500,000,000. Having regard to the political, social, and human
factors, as well as to the purely economic, I doubt if Germany could be
made to pay this sum annually over a period of 30 years; but it would
not be foolish to assert or to hope that she could.

Such a figure, allowing 5 per cent for interest, and 1 per cent for
repayment of capital, represents a capital sum having a present value of
about $8,500,000,000.[130]

I reach, therefore, the final conclusion that, including all methods of
payment--immediately transferable wealth, ceded property, and an annual
tribute--$10,000,000,000 is a safe maximum figure of Germany's capacity
to pay. In all the actual circumstances, I do not believe that she can
pay as much. Let those who consider this a very low figure, bear in mind
the following remarkable comparison. The wealth of France in 1871 was
estimated at a little less than half that of Germany in 1913. Apart from
changes in the value of money, an indemnity from Germany of
$2,500,000,000 would, therefore, be about comparable to the sum paid by
France in 1871; and as the real burden of an indemnity increases more
than in proportion to its amount, the payment of $10,000,000,000 by
Germany would have far severer consequences than the $1,000,000,000 paid
by France in 1871.

There is only one head under which I see a possibility of adding to the
figure reached on the line of argument adopted above; that is, if German
labor is actually transported to the devastated areas and there engaged
in the work of reconstruction. I have heard that a limited scheme of
this kind is actually in view. The additional contribution thus
obtainable depends on the number of laborers which the German Government
could contrive to maintain in this way and also on the number which,
over a period of years, the Belgian and French inhabitants would
tolerate in their midst. In any case, it would seem very difficult to
employ on the actual work of reconstruction, even over a number of
years, imported labor having a net present value exceeding (say)
$1,250,000,000; and even this would not prove in practice a net addition
to the annual contributions obtainable in other ways.

A capacity of $40,000,000,000 or even of $25,000,000,000 is, therefore,
not within the limits of reasonable possibility. It is for those who
believe that Germany can make an annual payment amounting to hundreds of
millions sterling to say _in what specific commodities_ they intend this
payment to be made and _in what markets_ the goods are to be sold. Until
they proceed to some degree of detail, and are able to produce some
tangible argument in favor of their conclusions, they do not deserve to
be believed.[131]

I make three provisos only, none of which affect the force of my
argument for immediate practical purposes.

_First_: if the Allies were to "nurse" the trade and industry of Germany
for a period of five or ten years, supplying her with large loans, and
with ample shipping, food, and raw materials during that period,
building up markets for her, and deliberately applying all their
resources and goodwill to making her the greatest industrial nation in
Europe, if not in the world, a substantially larger sum could probably
be extracted thereafter; for Germany is capable of very great
productivity.

_Second_: whilst I estimate in terms of money, I assume that there is no
revolutionary change in the purchasing power of our unit of value. If
the value of gold were to sink to a half or a tenth of its present
value, the real burden of a payment fixed in terms of gold would be
reduced proportionately. If a sovereign comes to be worth what a
shilling is worth now, then, of course, Germany can pay a larger sum
than I have named, measured in gold sovereigns.

_Third_: I assume that there is no revolutionary change in the yield of
Nature and material to man's labor. It is not _impossible_ that the
progress of science should bring within our reach methods and devices by
which the whole standard of life would be raised immeasurably, and a
given volume of products would represent but a portion of the human
effort which it represents now. In this case all standards of "capacity"
would be changed everywhere. But the fact that all things are _possible_
is no excuse for talking foolishly.

It is true that in 1870 no man could have predicted Germany's capacity
in 1910. We cannot expect to legislate for a generation or more. The
secular changes in man's economic condition and the liability of human
forecast to error are as likely to lead to mistake in one direction as
in another. We cannot as reasonable men do better than base our policy
on the evidence we have and adapt it to the five or ten years over which
we may suppose ourselves to have some measure of prevision; and we are
not at fault if we leave on one side the extreme chances of human
existence and of revolutionary changes in the order of Nature or of
man's relations to her. The fact that we have no adequate knowledge of
Germany's capacity to pay over a long period of years is no
justification (as I have heard some people claim that, it is) for the
statement that she can pay $50,000,000,000.

Why has the world been so credulous of the unveracities of politicians?
If an explanation is needed, I attribute this particular credulity to
the following influences in part.

In the first place, the vast expenditures of the war, the inflation of
prices, and the depreciation of currency, leading up to a complete
instability of the unit of value, have made us lose all sense of number
and magnitude in matters of finance. What we believed to be the limits
of possibility have been so enormously exceeded, and those who founded
their expectations on the past have been so often wrong, that the man in
the street is now prepared to believe anything which is told him with
some show of authority, and the larger the figure the more readily he
swallows it.

But those who look into the matter more deeply are sometimes misled by a
fallacy, much more plausible to reasonableness. Such a one might base
his conclusions on Germany's total surplus of annual productivity as
distinct from her export surplus. Helfferich's estimate of Germany's
annual increment of wealth in 1913 was $2,000,000,000 to $2,125,000,000
(exclusive of increased money value of existing land and property).
Before the war, Germany spent between $250,000,000 and $500,000,000 on
armaments, with which she can now dispense. Why, therefore, should she
not pay over to the Allies an annual sum of $2,500,000,000? This puts
the crude argument in its strongest and most plausible form.

But there are two errors in it. First of all, Germany's annual savings,
after what she has suffered in the war and by the Peace, will fall far
short of what they were before, and, if they are taken from her year by
year in future, they cannot again reach their previous level. The loss
of Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and Upper Silesia could not be assessed in
terms of surplus productivity at less than $250,000,000 annually.
Germany is supposed to have profited about $500,000,000 per annum from
her ships, her foreign investments, and her foreign banking and
connections, all of which have now been taken from her. Her saving on
armaments is far more than balanced by her annual charge for pensions
now estimated at $1,250,000,000,[132] which represents a real loss of
productive capacity. And even if we put on one side the burden of the
internal debt, which amounts to 24 milliards of marks, as being a
question of internal distribution rather than of productivity, we must
still allow for the foreign debt incurred by Germany during the war, the
exhaustion of her stock of raw materials, the depletion of her
live-stock, the impaired productivity of her soil from lack of manures
and of labor, and the diminution in her wealth from the failure to keep
up many repairs and renewals over a period of nearly five years. Germany
is not as rich as she was before the war, and the diminution in her
future savings for these reasons, quite apart from the factors
previously allowed for, could hardly be put at less than ten per cent,
that is $200,000,000 annually.

These factors have already reduced Germany's annual surplus to less than
the $500,000,000 at which we arrived on other grounds as the maximum of
her annual payments. But even if the rejoinder be made, that we have not
yet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in
Germany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there
is still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual
surplus available for home investment can only be converted into a
surplus available for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of
work performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for
domestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in
foreign trade. We are back on the same question which faced us in our
examination of the export trade--in _what_ export trade is German labor
going to find a greatly increased outlet? Labor can only he diverted
into new channels with loss of efficiency, and a large expenditure of
capital. The annual surplus which German labor can produce for capital
improvements at home is no measure, either theoretically or practically,
of the annual tribute which she can pay abroad.


IV. _The Reparation Commission_.

This body is so remarkable a construction and may, if it functions at
all, exert so wide an influence on the life of Europe, that its
attributes deserve a separate examination.

There are no precedents for the indemnity imposed on Germany under the
present Treaty; for the money exactions which formed part of the
settlement after previous wars have differed in two fundamental respects
from this one. The sum demanded has been determinate and has been
measured in a lump sum of money; and so long as the defeated party was
meeting the annual instalments of cash no consequential interference was
necessary.

But for reasons already elucidated, the exactions in this case are not
yet determinate, and the sum when fixed will prove in excess of what can
be paid in cash and in excess also of what can be paid at all. It was
necessary, therefore, to set up a body to establish the bill of claim,
to fix the mode of payment, and to approve necessary abatements and
delays. It was only possible to place this body in a position to exact
the utmost year by year by giving it wide powers over the internal
economic life of the enemy countries, who are to be treated henceforward
as bankrupt estates to be administered by and for the benefit of the
creditors. In fact, however, its powers and functions have been enlarged
even beyond what was required for this purpose, and the Reparation
Commission has been established as the final arbiter on numerous
economic and financial issues which it was convenient to leave unsettled
in the Treaty itself.[134]

The powers and constitution of the Reparation Commission are mainly laid
down in Articles 233-241 and Annex II. of the Reparation Chapter of the
Treaty with Germany. But the same Commission is to exercise authority
over Austria and Bulgaria, and possibly over Hungary and Turkey, when
Peace is made with these countries. There are, therefore, analogous
articles _mutatis mudandis_ in the Austrian Treaty[135] and in the
Bulgarian Treaty.[136]

The principal Allies are each represented by one chief delegate.
The delegates of the United States, Great Britain, France, and
Italy take part in all proceedings; the delegate of Belgium in all
proceedings except those attended by the delegates of Japan or the
Serb-Croat-Slovene State; the delegate of Japan in all proceedings
affecting maritime or specifically Japanese questions; and the
delegate of the Serb-Croat-Slovene State when questions relating to
Austria, Hungary, or Bulgaria are under consideration. Other allies
are to be represented by delegates, without the power to vote,
whenever their respective claims and interests are under examination.

In general the Commission decides by a majority vote, except in certain
specific cases where unanimity is required, of which the most important
are the cancellation of German indebtedness, long postponement of the
instalments, and the sale of German bonds of indebtedness. The
Commission is endowed with full executive authority to carry out its
decisions. It may set up an executive staff and delegate authority to
its officers. The Commission and its staff are to enjoy diplomatic
privileges, and its salaries are to be paid by Germany, who will,
however, have no voice in fixing them, If the Commission is to discharge
adequately its numerous functions, it will be necessary for it to
establish a vast polyglot bureaucratic organization, with a staff of
hundreds. To this organization, the headquarters of which will be in
Paris, the economic destiny of Central Europe is to be entrusted.

Its main functions are as follows:--

1. The Commission will determine the precise figure of the claim against
the enemy Powers by an examination in detail of the claims of each of
the Allies under Annex I. of the Reparation Chapter. This task must be
completed by May, 1921. It shall give to the German Government and to
Germany's allies "a just opportunity to be heard, but not to take any
part whatever in the decisions of the Commission." That is to say, the
Commission will act as a party and a judge at the same time.

2. Having determined the claim, it will draw up a schedule of payments
providing for the discharge of the whole sum with interest within thirty
years. From time to time it shall, with a view to modifying the schedule
within the limits of possibility, "consider the resources and capacity
of Germany ... giving her representatives a just opportunity to be heard."

"In periodically estimating Germany's capacity to pay, the Commission
shall examine the German system of taxation, first, to the end that the
sums for reparation which Germany is required to pay shall become a
charge upon all her revenues prior to that for the service or discharge
of any domestic loan, and secondly, so as to satisfy itself that, in
general, the German scheme of taxation is fully as heavy proportionately
as that of any of the Powers represented on the Commission."

3. Up to May, 1921, the Commission has power, with a view to securing
the payment of $5,000,000,000, to demand the surrender of any piece of
German property whatever, wherever situated: that is to say, "Germany
shall pay in such installments and in such manner, whether in gold,
commodities, ships, securities, or otherwise, as the Reparation
Commission may fix."

4. The Commission will decide which of the rights and interests of
German nationals in public utility undertakings operating in Russia,
China, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, or in any territory
formerly belonging to Germany or her allies, are to be expropriated and
transferred to the Commission itself; it will assess the value of the
interests so transferred; and it will divide the spoils.

5 The Commission will determine how much of the resources thus stripped
from Germany must be returned to her to keep enough life in her economic
organization to enable her to continue to make Reparation payments in
future.[137]

6. The Commission will assess the value, without appeal or arbitration,
of the property and rights ceded under the Armistice, and under the
Treaty,--roiling-stock, the mercantile marine, river craft, cattle, the
Saar mines, the property in ceded territory for which credit is to be
given, and so forth.

7. The Commission will determine the amounts and values (within certain
defined limits) of the contributions which Germany is to make in kind
year by year under the various Annexes to the Reparation Chapter.

8. The Commission will provide for the restitution by Germany of
property which can be identified.

9. The Commission will receive, administer, and distribute all receipts
from Germany in cash or in kind. It will also issue and market German
bonds of indebtedness.

10. The Commission will assign the share of the pre-war public debt to
be taken over by the ceded areas of Schleswig, Poland, Danzig, and Upper
Silesia. The Commission will also distribute the public debt of the late
Austro-Hungarian Empire between its constituent parts.

11. The Commission will liquidate the Austro-Hungarian Bank, and will
supervise the withdrawal and replacement of the currency system of the
late Austro-Hungarian Empire.

12. It is for the Commission to report if, in their judgment, Germany is
falling short in fulfillment of her obligations, and to advise methods
of coercion.

13. In general, the Commission, acting through a subordinate body, will
perform the same functions for Austria and Bulgaria as for Germany, and
also, presumably, for Hungary and Turkey.[138]

There are also many other relatively minor duties assigned to the
Commission. The above summary, however, shows sufficiently the scope and
significance of its authority. This authority is rendered of far greater
significance by the fact that the demands of the Treaty generally exceed
Germany's capacity. Consequently the clauses which allow the Commission
to make abatements, if in their judgment the economic conditions of
Germany require it, will render it in many different particulars the
arbiter of Germany's economic life. The Commission is not only to
inquire into Germany's general capacity to pay, and to decide (in the
early years) what import of foodstuffs and raw materials is necessary;
it is authorized to exert pressure on the German system of taxation
(Annex II. para. 12(_b_))[139] and on German internal expenditure, with
a view to insuring that Reparation payments are a first charge on the
country's entire resources; and it is to decide on the effect on German
economic life of demands for machinery, cattle, etc., and of the
scheduled deliveries of coal.

By Article 240 of the Treaty Germany expressly recognizes the Commission
and its powers "as the same may be constituted by the Allied and
Associated Governments," and "agrees irrevocably to the possession and
exercise by such Commission of the power and authority given to it under
the present Treaty." She undertakes to furnish the Commission with all
relevant information. And finally in Article 241, "Germany undertakes to
pass, issue, and maintain in force any legislation, orders, and decrees
that may be necessary to give complete effect to these provisions."

The comments on this of the German Financial Commission at Versailles
were hardly an exaggeration:--"German democracy is thus annihilated at
the very moment when the German people was about to build it up after a
severe struggle--annihilated by the very persons who throughout the war
never tired of maintaining that they sought to bring democracy to us....
Germany is no longer a people and a State, but becomes a mere trade
concern placed by its creditors in the hands of a receiver, without its
being granted so much as the opportunity to prove its willingness to
meet its obligations of its own accord. The Commission, which is to have
its permanent headquarters outside Germany, will possess in Germany
incomparably greater rights than the German Emperor ever possessed, the
German people under its rÈgime would remain for decades to come shorn
of all rights, and deprived, to a far greater extent than any people in
the days of absolutism, of any independence of action, of any individual
aspiration in its economic or even in its ethical progress."

In their reply to these observations the Allies refused to admit that
there was any substance, ground, or force in them. "The observations of
the German Delegation," they pronounced, "present a view of this
Commission so distorted and so inexact that it is difficult to believe
that the clauses of the Treaty have been calmly or carefully examined.
It is not an engine of oppression or a device for interfering with
German sovereignty. It has no forces at its command; it has no executive
powers within the territory of Germany; it cannot, as is suggested,
direct or control the educational or other systems of the country. Its
business is to ask what is to be paid; to satisfy itself that Germany
can pay; and to report to the Powers, whose delegation it is, in case
Germany makes default. If Germany raises the money required in her own
way, the Commission cannot order that it shall be raised in some other
way; if Germany offers payment in kind, the Commission may accept such
payment, but, except as specified in the Treaty itself, the Commission
cannot require such a payment."

This is not a candid statement of the scope and authority of the
Reparation Commission, as will be seen by a comparison of its terms with
the summary given above or with the Treaty itself. Is not, for example,
the statement that the Commission "has no forces at its command" a
little difficult to justify in view of Article 430 of the Treaty, which
runs:--"In case, either during the occupation or after the expiration of
the fifteen years referred to above, the Reparation Commission finds
that Germany refuses to observe the whole or part of her obligations
under the present Treaty with regard to Reparation, the whole or part of
the areas specified in Article 429 will be reoccupied immediately by the
Allied and Associated Powers"? The decision, as to whether Germany has
kept her engagements and whether it is possible for her to keep them, is
left, it should be observed, not to the League of Nations, but to the
Reparation Commission itself; and an adverse ruling on the part of the
Commission is to be followed "immediately" by the use of armed force.
Moreover, the depreciation of the powers of the Commission attempted in
the Allied reply largely proceeds from the assumption that it is quite
open to Germany to "raise the money required in her own way," in which
case it is true that many of the powers of the Reparation Commission
would not come into practical effect; whereas in truth one of the main
reasons for setting up the Commission at all is the expectation that
Germany will not be able to carry the burden nominally laid upon her.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is reported that the people of Vienna, hearing that a section of the
Reparation Commission is about to visit them, have decided
characteristically to pin their hopes on it. A financial body can
obviously take nothing from them, for they have nothing; therefore this
body must be for the purpose of assisting and relieving them. Thus do
the Viennese argue, still light-headed in adversity. But perhaps they
are right. The Reparation Commission will come into very close contact
with the problems of Europe; and it will bear a responsibility
proportionate to its powers. It may thus come to fulfil a very different
rÙle from that which some of its authors intended for it. Transferred to
the League of Nations, an appanage of justice and no longer of interest,
who knows that by a change of heart and object the Reparation Commission
may not yet be transformed from an instrument of oppression and rapine
into an economic council of Europe, whose object is the restoration of
life and of happiness, even in the enemy countries?

_V_. _The German Counter-Proposals_


The German counter-proposals were somewhat obscure, and also rather
disingenuous. It will be remembered that those clauses of the Reparation
Chapter which dealt with the issue of bonds by Germany produced on the
public mind the impression that the Indemnity had been fixed at
$25,000,000,000, or at any rate at this figure as a minimum. The German
Delegation set out, therefore, to construct their reply on the basis of
this figure, assuming apparently that public opinion in Allied countries
would not be satisfied with less than the appearance of $25,000,000,000;
and, as they were not really prepared to offer so large a figure, they
exercised their ingenuity to produce a formula which might be
represented to Allied opinion as yielding this amount, whilst really
representing a much more modest sum. The formula produced was
transparent to any one who read it carefully and knew the facts, and it
could hardly have been expected by its authors to deceive the Allied
negotiators. The German tactic assumed, therefore, that the latter were
secretly as anxious as the Germans themselves to arrive at a settlement
which bore some relation to the facts, and that they would therefore be
willing, in view of the entanglements which they had got themselves into
with their own publics, to practise a little collusion in drafting the
Treaty,--a supposition which in slightly different circumstances might
have had a good deal of foundation. As matters actually were, this
subtlety did not benefit them, and they would have done much better with
a straightforward and candid estimate of what they believed to be the
amount of their liabilities on the one hand, and their capacity to pay
on the other.

The German offer of an alleged sum of $25,000,000,000 amounted to the
following. In the first place it was conditional on concessions in the
Treaty insuring that "Germany shall retain the territorial integrity
corresponding to the Armistice Convention,[140] that she shall keep her
colonial possessions and merchant ships, including those of large
tonnage, that in her own country and in the world at large she shall
enjoy the same freedom of action as all other peoples, that all war
legislation shall be at once annulled, and that all interferences during
the war with her economic rights and with German private property, etc.,
shall be treated in accordance with the principle of reciprocity";--that
is to say, the offer is conditional on the greater part of the rest of
the Treaty being abandoned. In the second place, the claims are not to
exceed a maximum of $25,000,000,000, of which $5,000,000,000 is to be
discharged by May 1, 1926; and no part of this sum is to carry interest
pending the payment of it.[141] In the third place, there are to be
allowed as credit against it (amongst other things): (_a_) the value of
all deliveries under the Armistice, including military material (_e.g._
Germany's navy); (_b_) the value of all railways and State property in
ceded territory; (_c_) the _pro rata_ share of all ceded territory in
the German public debt (including the war debt) and in the Reparation
payments which this territory would have had to bear if it had remained
part of Germany; and (_d_) the value of the cession of Germany's claims
for sums lent by her to her allies in the war.[142]

The credits to be deducted under (_a_), (_b_), (_c_), and (_d_) might be
in excess of those allowed in the actual Treaty, according to a rough
estimate, by a sum of as much as $10,000,000,000, although the sum to be
allowed under (_d_) can hardly be calculated.

If, therefore, we are to estimate the real value of the German offer of
$25,000,000,000 on the basis laid down by the Treaty, we must first of
all deduct $10,000,000,000 claimed for offsets which the Treaty does not
allow, and then halve the remainder in order to obtain the present value
of a deferred payment on which interest is not chargeable. This reduces
the offer to $7,500,000,000, as compared with the $40,000,000,000 which,
according to my rough estimate, the Treaty demands of her.

This in itself was a very substantial offer--indeed it evoked widespread
criticism in Germany--though, in view of the fact that it was
conditional on the abandonment of the greater part of the rest of the
Treaty, it could hardly be regarded as a serious one.[143] But the
German Delegation would have done better if they had stated in less
equivocal language how far they felt able to go.

In the final reply of the Allies to this counter-proposal there is one
important provision, which I have not attended to hitherto, but which
can be conveniently dealt with in this place. Broadly speaking, no
concessions were entertained on the Reparation Chapter as it was
originally drafted, but the Allies recognized the inconvenience of the
_indeterminacy_ of the burden laid upon Germany and proposed a method by
which the final total of claim might be established at an earlier date
than May 1, 1921. They promised, therefore, that at any time within four
months of the signature of the Treaty (that is to say, up to the end of
October, 1919), Germany should be at liberty to submit an offer of a
lump sum in settlement of her whole liability as defined in the Treaty,
and within two months thereafter (that is to say, before the end of
1919) the Allies "will, so far as may be possible, return their answers
to any proposals that may be made."

This offer is subject to three conditions. "Firstly, the German
authorities will be expected, before making such proposals, to confer
with the representatives of the Powers directly concerned. Secondly,
such offers must be unambiguous and must be precise and clear. Thirdly,
they must accept the categories and the Reparation clauses as matters
settled beyond discussion."

The offer, as made, does not appear to contemplate any opening up of the
problem of Germany's capacity to pay. It is only concerned with the
establishment of the total bill of claims as defined in the
Treaty--whether (_e.g._) it is $35,000,000,000, $40,000,000,000, or
$50,000,000,000. "The questions," the Allies' reply adds, "are bare
questions of fact, namely, the amount of the liabilities, and they are
susceptible of being treated in this way."

If the promised negotiations are really conducted on these lines, they
are not likely to be fruitful. It will not be much easier to arrive at
an agreed figure before the end of 1919 that it was at the time of the
Conference; and it will not help Germany's financial position to know
for certain that she is liable for the huge sum which on any computation
the Treaty liabilities must amount to. These negotiations do offer,
however, an opportunity of reopening the whole question of the
Reparation payments, although it is hardly to be hoped that at so very
early a date, public opinion in the countries of the Allies has changed
its mood sufficiently.[144]

       *       *       *       *       *

I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended
either on our own pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing
Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of
millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness
should be abhorrent and detestable,--abhorrent and detestable, even if
it were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow
the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe. Some preach it in the
name of Justice. In the great events of man's history, in the unwinding
of the complex fates of nations Justice is not so simple. And if it
were, nations are not authorized, by religion or by natural morals, to
visit on the children of their enemies the misdoings of parents or of
rulers.


FOOTNOTES:

[76] "With reservation that any future claims and demands of
the Allies and the United States of America remain unaffected, the
following financial conditions are required: Reparation for damage done.
Whilst Armistice lasts, no public securities shall be removed by the
enemy which can serve as a pledge to the Allies for recovery or
reparation of war losses. Immediate restitution of cash deposit in
National Bank of Belgium, and, in general, immediate return of all
documents, of specie, stock, shares, paper money, together with plant
for issue thereof, touching public or private interests in invaded
countries. Restitution of Russian and Roumanian gold yielded to Germany
or taken by that Power. This gold to be delivered in trust to the Allies
until signature of peace."

[77] It is to be noticed, in passing, that they contain nothing
which limits the damage to damage inflicted contrary to the recognized
rules of warfare. That is to say, it is permissible to include claims
arising out of the legitimate capture of a merchantman at sea, as well
as the costs of illegal submarine warfare.

[78] Mark-paper or mark-credits owned in ex-occupied territory
by Allied nationals should be included, if at all, in the settlement of
enemy debts, along with other sums owed to Allied nationals, and not in
connection with reparation.

[79] A special claim on behalf of Belgium was actually included
In the Peace Treaty, and was accepted by the German representatives
without demur.

[80] To the British observer, one scene, however, stood out
distinguished from the rest--the field of Ypres. In that desolate and
ghostly spot, the natural color and humors of the landscape and the
climate seemed designed to express to the traveler the memories of the
ground. A visitor to the salient early in November, 1918, when a few
German bodies still added a touch of realism and human horror, and the
great struggle was not yet certainly ended, could feel there, as nowhere
else, the present outrage of war, and at the same time the tragic and
sentimental purification which to the future will in some degree
transform its harshness.

[81] These notes, estimated to amount to no less than six
thousand million marks, are now a source of embarrassment and great
potential loss to the Belgian Government, inasmuch as on their recovery
of the country they took them over from their nationals in exchange for
Belgian notes at the rate of Fr. 120 = Mk. 1. This rate of exchange, being
substantially in excess of the value of the mark-notes at the rate of
exchange current at the time (and enormously in excess of the rate to
which the mark notes have since fallen, the Belgian franc being now
worth more than three marks), was the occasion of the smuggling of
mark-notes into Belgium on an enormous scale, to take advantage of the
profit obtainable. The Belgian Government took this very imprudent step,
partly because they hoped to persuade the Peace Conference to make the
redemption of these bank-notes, at the par of exchange, a first charge
on German assets. The Peace Conference held, however, that Reparation
proper must take precedence of the adjustment of improvident banking
transactions effected at an excessive rate of exchange. The possession
by the Belgian Government of this great mass of German currency, in
addition to an amount of nearly two thousand million marks held by the
French Government which they similarly exchanged for the benefit of the
population of the invaded areas and of Alsace-Lorraine, is a serious
aggravation of the exchange position of the mark. It will certainly be
desirable for the Belgian and German Governments to come to some
arrangement as to its disposal, though this is rendered difficult by the
prior lien held by the Reparation Commission over all German assets
available for such purposes.

[82] It should be added, in fairness, that the very high claims
put forward on behalf of Belgium generally include not only devastation
proper, but all kinds of other items, as, for example, the profits and
earnings which Belgians might reasonably have expected to earn if there
had been no war.

(_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, July, 1919).

[84] Other estimates vary from $12,100,000,000 to
$13,400,000,000. See Stamp, _loc. cit._

[85] This was clearly and courageously pointed out by M.
Charles Gide in _L'Emancipation_ for February, 1919.

[86] For details of these and other figures, see Stamp, _loc.
cit._

[87] Even when the extent of the material damage has been
established, it will be exceedingly difficult to put a price on it,
which must largely depend on the period over which restoration is
spread, and the methods adopted. It would be impossible to make the
damage good in a year or two at any price, and an attempt to do so at a
rate which was excessive in relation to the amount of labor and
materials at hand might force prices up to almost any level. We must, I
think, assume a cost of labor and materials about equal to that current
in the world generally. In point of fact, however, we may safely assume
that literal restoration will never be attempted. Indeed, it would be
very wasteful to do so. Many of the townships were old and unhealthy,
and many of the hamlets miserable. To re-erect the same type of building
in the same places would be foolish. As for the land, the wise course
may be in some cases to leave long strips of it to Nature for many years
to come. An aggregate money sum should be computed as fairly
representing the value of the material damage, and France should be left
to expend it in the manner she thinks wisest with a view to her economic
enrichment as a whole. The first breeze of this controversy has already
blown through France. A long and inconclusive debate occupied the
Chamber during the spring of 1919, as to whether inhabitants of the
devastated area receiving compensation should be compelled to expend it
in restoring the identical property, or whether they should be free to
use it as they like. There was evidently a great deal to be said on both
sides; in the former case there would be much hardship and uncertainty
for owners who could not, many of them, expect to recover the effective
use of their property perhaps for years to come, and yet would not be
free to set themselves up elsewhere; on the other hand, if such persons
were allowed to take their compensation and go elsewhere, the
countryside of Northern France would never be put right. Nevertheless I
believe that the wise course will be to allow great latitude and let
economic motives take their own course.

[88] _La Richesse de la France devant la Guerre_, published in
1916.

[89] _Revue Bleue_, February 3, 1919. This is quoted in a very
valuable selection of French estimates and expressions of opinion,
forming chapter iv. of _La Liquidation financiËre de la Guerre_, by H.
Charriaut and R. Hacault. The general magnitude of my estimate is
further confirmed by the extent of the repairs already effected, as set
forth in a speech delivered by M. Tardieu on October 10, 1919, in which
he said: "On September 16 last, of 2246 kilomËtres of railway track
destroyed, 2016 had been repaired; of 1075 kilomËtres of canal, 700; of
1160 constructions, such as bridges and tunnels, which had been blown
up, 588 had been replaced; of 550,000 houses ruined by bombardment,
60,000 had been rebuilt; and of 1,800,000 hectares of ground rendered
useless by battle, 400,000 had been recultivated, 200,000 hectares of
which are now ready to be sown. Finally, more than 10,000,000 mËtres of
barbed wire had been removed."

[90] Some of these estimates include allowance for contingent
and immaterial damage as well as for direct material injury.

[91] A substantial part of this was lost in the service of the
Allies; this must not be duplicated by inclusion both in their claims
and in ours.

[92] The fact that no separate allowance is made in the above
for the sinking of 675 fishing vessels of 71,765 tons gross, or for the
1855 vessels of 8,007,967 tons damaged or molested, but not sunk, may be
set off against what may be an excessive figure for replacement cost.

[93] The losses of the Greek mercantile marine were excessively
high, as a result of the dangers of the Mediterranean; but they were
largely incurred on the service of the other Allies, who paid for them
directly or indirectly. The claims of Greece for maritime losses
incurred on the service of her own nationals would not be very
considerable.

[94] There is a reservation in the Peace Treaty on this
question. "The Allied and Associated Powers formally reserve the right
of Russia to obtain from Germany restitution and reparation based on the
principles of the present Treaty" (Art. 116).

[95] Dr. Diouritch in his "Economic and Statistical Survey of
the Southern Slav Nations" (_Journal of Royal Statistical Society_, May,
1919), quotes some extraordinary figures of the loss of life: "According
to the official returns, the number of those fallen in battle or died in
captivity up to the last Serbian offensive, amounted to 320,000, which
means that one half of Serbia's male population, from 18 to 60 years of
age, perished outright in the European War. In addition, the Serbian
Medical Authorities estimate that about 300,000 people have died from
typhus among the civil population, and the losses among the population
interned in enemy camps are estimated at 50,000. During the two Serbian
retreats and during the Albanian retreat the losses among children and
young people are estimated at 200,000. Lastly, during over three years
of enemy occupation, the losses in lives owing to the lack of proper
food and medical attention are estimated at 250,000." Altogether, he
puts the losses in life at above 1,000,000, or more than one-third of
the population of Old Serbia.

[96] _Come si calcola e a quanto ammonta la richezza d'Italia e
delle altre principali nazioni_, published in 1919.

[97] Very large claims put forward by the Serbian authorities
include many hypothetical items of indirect and non-material damage; but
these, however real, are not admissible under our present formula.

[98] Assuming that in her case $1,250,000,000 are included for
the general expenses of the war defrayed out of loans made to Belgium by
her allies.

[99] It must be said to Mr. Hughes' honor that he apprehended
from the first the bearing of the pre-Armistice negotiations on our
right to demand an indemnity covering the full costs of the war,
protested against our ever having entered into such engagements, and
maintained loudly that he had been no party to them and could not
consider himself bound by them. His indignation may have been partly due
to the fact that Australia, not having been ravaged, would have no
claims at all under the more limited interpretation of our rights.

[100] The whole cost of the war has been estimated at from
$120,000,000,000 upwards. This would mean an annual payment for interest
(apart from sinking fund) of $6,000,000,000. Could any expert Committee
have reported that Germany can pay this sum?

[101] But unhappily they did not go down with their flags
flying very gloriously. For one reason or another their leaders
maintained substantial silence. What a different position in the
country's estimation they might hold now if they had suffered defeat
amidst firm protests against the fraud, chicane, and dishonor of the
whole proceedings.

[102] Only after the most painful consideration have I written
these words. The almost complete absence of protest from the leading
Statesmen of England makes one feel that one must have made some
mistake. But I believe that I know all the facts, and I can discover no
such mistake. In any case I have set forth all the relevant engagements
in Chapter IV. and at the beginning of this chapter, so that the reader
can form his own judgment.

[103] In conversation with Frenchmen who were private persons
and quite unaffected by political considerations, this aspect became
very clear. You might persuade them that some current estimates as to
the amount to be got out of Germany were quite fantastic. Yet at the end
they would always come back to where they had started: "But Germany
_must_ pay; for, otherwise, what is to happen to France?"

[104] A further paragraph claims the war costs of Belgium "in
accordance with Germany's pledges, already given, as to complete
restoration for Belgium."

[105] The challenge of the other Allies, as well as the enemy,
had to be met; for in view of the limited resources of the latter, the
other Allies had perhaps a greater interest than the enemy in seeing
that no one of their number established an excessive claim.

[106] M. Klotz has estimated the French claims on this head at
$15,000,000,000 (75 milliard francs, made up of 13 milliard for
allowances, 60 for pensions, and 2 for widows). If this figure is
correct, the others should probably be scaled up also.

[107] That is to say, I claim for the aggregate figure an
accuracy within 25 per cent.

[108] In his speech of September 5, 1919, addressed to the
French Chamber, M. Klotz estimated the total Allied claims against
Germany under the Treaty at $75,000,000,000, which would accumulate at
interest until 1921, and be paid off thereafter by 34 annual
installments of about $5,000,000,000 each, of which France would receive
about $2,750,000,000 annually. "The general effect of the statement
(that France would receive from Germany this annual payment) proved," it
is reported, "appreciably encouraging to the country as a whole, and was
immediately reflected in the improved tone on the Bourse and throughout
the business world in France." So long as such statements can be
accepted in Paris without protest, there can be no financial or economic
future for France, and a catastrophe of disillusion is not far distant.

[109] As a matter of subjective judgment, I estimate for this
figure an accuracy of 10 per cent in deficiency and 20 per cent in
excess, _i.e._ that the result will lie between $32,000,000,000 and
$44,000,000,000.

[110] Germany is also liable under the Treaty, as an addition
to her liabilities for Reparation, to pay all the costs of the Armies of
Occupation _after_ Peace is signed for the fifteen subsequent years of
occupation. So far as the text of the Treaty goes, there is nothing to
limit the size of these armies, and France could, therefore, by
quartering the whole of her normal standing army in the occupied area,
shift the charge from her own taxpayers to those of Germany,--though in
reality any such policy would be at the expense not of Germany, who by
hypothesis is already paying for Reparation up to the full limit of her
capacity, but of France's Allies, who would receive so much less in
respect of Reparation. A White Paper (Cmd. 240) has, however, been
issued, in which is published a declaration by the Governments of the
United States, Great Britain, and France engaging themselves to limit
the sum payable annually by Germany to cover the cost of occupation to
$60,000,000 "as soon as the Allied and Associated Powers _concerned_ are
convinced that the conditions of disarmament by Germany are being
satisfactorily fulfilled." The word which I have italicized is a little
significant. The three Powers reserve to themselves the liberty to
modify this arrangement at any time if they agree that it is necessary.

[111] Art. 235. The force of this Article is somewhat
strengthened by Article 251, by virtue of which dispensations may also
be granted for "other payments" as well as for food and raw material.

[112] This is the effect of Para. 12 (_c_) of Annex II. of the
Reparation Chapter, leaving minor complications on one side. The Treaty
fixes the payments in terms of _gold marks_, which are converted in the
above rate of 20 to $5.

[113] If, _per impossibile_, Germany discharged $2,500,000,000
in cash or kind by 1921, her annual payments would be at the rate of
$312,500,000 from 1921 to 1925 and of $750,000,000 thereafter.

[114] Para. 16 of Annex II. of The Reparation Chapter. There is
also an obscure provision by which interest may be charged "on sums
arising out of _material damage_ as from November 11, 1918, up to May 1,
1921." This seems to differentiate damage to property from damage to the
person in favor of the former. It does not affect Pensions and
Allowances, the cost of which is capitalized as at the date of the
coming into force of the Treaty.

[115] On the assumption which no one supports and even the most
optimistic fear to be unplausible, that Germany can pay the full charge
for interest and sinking fund _from the outset_, the annual payment
would amount to $2,400,000,000.

[116] Under Para. 13 of Annex II. unanimity is required (i.)
for any postponement beyond 1930 of installments due between 1921 and
1926, and (ii.) for any postponement for more than three years of
instalments due after 1926. Further, under Art. 234, the Commission may
not cancel any part of the indebtedness without the specific authority
of _all_ the Governments represented on the Commission.

[117] On July 23, 1914, the amount was $339,000,000.

[118] Owing to the very high premium which exists on German
silver coin, as the combined result of the depreciation of the mark and
the appreciation of silver, it is highly improbable that it will be
possible to extract such coin out of the pockets of the people. But it
may gradually leak over the frontier by the agency of private
speculators, and thus indirectly benefit the German exchange position as
a whole.

[119] The Allies made the supply of foodstuffs to Germany
during the Armistice, mentioned above, conditional on the provisional
transfer to them of the greater part of the Mercantile Marine, to be
operated by them for the purpose of shipping foodstuffs to Europe
generally, and to Germany in particular. The reluctance of the Germans
to agree to this was productive of long and dangerous delays in the
supply of food, but the abortive Conferences of TrËves and Spa (January
16, February 14-16, and March 4-5, 1919) were at last followed by the
Agreement of Brussels (March 14, 1919). The unwillingness of the Germans
to conclude was mainly due to the lack of any absolute guarantee on the
part of the Allies that, if they surrendered the ships, they would get
the food. But assuming reasonable good faith on the part of the latter
(their behavior in respect of certain other clauses of the Armistice,
however, had not been impeccable and gave the enemy some just grounds
for suspicion), their demand was not an improper one; for without the
German ships the business of transporting the food would have been
difficult, if not impossible, and the German ships surrendered or their
equivalent were in fact almost wholly employed in transporting food to
Germany itself. Up to June 30, 1919, 176 German ships of 1,025,388 gross
tonnage had been surrendered, to the Allies in accordance with the
Brussels Agreement.

[120] The amount of tonnage transferred may be rather greater
and the value per ton rather less. The aggregate value involved is not
likely, however, to be less than $500,000,000 or greater than
$750,000,000.

[121] This census was carried out by virtue of a Decree of
August 23, 1918. On March 22, 1917, the German Government acquired
complete control over the utilization of foreign securities in German
possession; and in May, 1917, it began to exercise these powers for the
mobilization of certain Swedish, Danish, and Swiss securities.

[A] Plus $2,500,000 for investments other than securities.

[B] Net investments, _i.e._ after allowance for property in
Germany owned abroad. This may also be the case with some of the other
estimates.

[C] This estimate, given in the _Weltwirtschaftszeitung_ (June
13, 1919), is an estimate of the value of Germany's foreign investments
as at the outbreak of war.

[123] I have made no deduction for securities in the ownership
of Alsace-Lorrainers and others who have now ceased to be German
nationals.

[124] In all these estimates, I am conscious of being driven by
a fear of overstating the case against the Treaty, of giving figures in
excess of my own real judgment. There is a great difference between
putting down on paper fancy estimates of Germany's resources and
actually extracting contributions in the form of cash. I do not myself
believe that the Reparation Commission will secure real resources from
the above items by May, 1921, even as great as the _lower_ of the two
figures given above.

[125] The Treaty (see Art. 114) leaves it very dubious how far
the Danish Government is under an obligation to make payments to the
Reparation Commission in respect of its acquisition of Schleswig. They
might, for instance, arrange for various offsets such as the value of
the mark notes held by the inhabitants of ceded areas. In any case the
amount of money involved is quite small. The Danish Government is
raising a loan for $33,000,000 (kr. 120,000,000) for the joint purposes
of "taking over Schleswig's share of the German debt, for buying German
public property, for helping the Schleswig population, and for settling
the currency question."

[126] Here again my own judgment would carry me much further
and I should doubt the possibility of Germany's exports equaling her
imports during this period. But the statement in the text goes far
enough for the purpose of my argument.

[127] It has been estimated that the cession of territory to
France, apart from the loss of Upper Silesia, may reduce Germany's
annual pre-war production of steel ingots from 20,000,000 tons to
14,000,000 tons, and increase France's capacity from 5,000,000 tons to
11,000,000 tons.

[128] Germany's exports of sugar in 1913 amounted to 1,110,073
tons of the value of $65,471,500, of which 838,583 tons were exported to
the United Kingdom at a value of $45,254,000. These figures were in
excess of the normal, the average total exports for the five years
ending 1913 being about $50,000,000.

[129] The necessary price adjustment, which is required, on
both sides of this account, will be made _en bloc_ later.

[130] If the amount of the sinking fund be reduced, and the
annual payment is continued over a greater number of years, the present
value--so powerful is the operation of compound interest--cannot be
materially increased. A payment of $500,000,000 annually _in
perpetuity_, assuming interest, as before, at 5 per cent, would only
raise the present value to $10,000,000,000.

[131] As an example of public misapprehension on economic
affairs, the following letter from Sir Sidney Low to _The Times_ of the
3rd December, 1918, deserves quotation: "I have seen authoritative
estimates which place the gross value of Germany's mineral and chemical
resources as high as $1,250,000,000,000 or even more; and the Ruhr basin
mines alone are said to be worth over $225,000,000,000. It is certain,
at any rate, that the capital value of these natural supplies is much
greater than the total war debts of all the Allied States. Why should
not some portion of this wealth be diverted for a sufficient period from
its present owners and assigned to the peoples whom Germany has
assailed, deported, and injured? The Allied Governments might justly
require Germany to surrender to them the use of such of her mines, and
mineral deposits as would yield, say, from $500,000,000 to
$1,000,000,000 annually for the next 30, 40, or 50 years. By this means
we could obtain sufficient compensation from Germany without unduly
stimulating her manufactures and export trade to our detriment." It is
not clear why, if Germany has wealth exceeding $1,250,000,000,000. Sir
Sidney Low is content with the trifling sum of $500,000,000 to
$1,000,000,000 annually. But his letter is an admirable _reductio ad
absurdum_ of a certain line of thought. While a mode of calculation,
which estimates the value of coal miles deep in the bowels of the earth
as high as in a coal scuttle, of an annual lease of $5000 for 999 years
at $4,995,000 and of a field (presumably) at the value of all the crops
it will grow to the end of recorded time, opens up great possibilities,
it is also double-edged. If Germany's total resources are worth
$1,250,000,000,000, those she will part with in the cession of
Alsace-Lorraine and Upper Silesia should be more than sufficient to pay
the entire costs of the war and reparation together. In point of fact,
the _present_ market value of all the mines in Germany of every kind has
been estimated at $1,500,000,000, or a little more than one-thousandth
part of Sir Sidney Low's expectations.

[132] The conversion at par of 5,000 million marks overstates,
by reason of the existing depreciation of the mark, the present money
burden of the actual pensions payments, but not, in all probability, the
real loss of national productivity as a result of the casualties
suffered in the war.

[133] It cannot be overlooked, in passing, that in its results
on a country's surplus productivity a lowering of the standard of life
acts both ways. Moreover, we are without experience of the psychology of
a white race under conditions little short of servitude. It is, however,
generally supposed that if the whole of a man's surplus production is
taken from him, his efficiency and his industry are diminished, The
entrepreneur and the inventor will not contrive, the trader and the
shopkeeper will not save, the laborer will not toil, if the fruits of
their industry are set aside, not for the benefit of their children,
their old age, their pride, or their position, but for the enjoyment of
a foreign conqueror.

[134] In the course of the compromises and delays of the
Conference, there were many questions on which, in order to reach any
conclusion at all, it was necessary to leave a margin of vagueness and
uncertainty. The whole method of the Conference tended towards
this,--the Council of Four wanted, not so much a settlement, as a
treaty. On political and territorial questions the tendency was to leave
the final arbitrament to the League of Nations. But on financial and
economic questions, the final decision has generally be a left with the
Reparation Commission,--in spite of its being an executive body composed
of interested parties.

[135] The sum to be paid by Austria for Reparation is left to
the absolute discretion of the Reparation Commission, no determinate
figure of any kind being mentioned in the text of the Treaty Austrian
questions are to be handled by a special section of the Reparation
Commission, but the section will have no powers except such as the main
Commission may delegate.

[136] Bulgaria is to pay an indemnity of $450,000,000 by
half-yearly instalments, beginning July 1, 1920. These sums will be
collected, on behalf of the Reparation Commission, by an Inter-Ally
Commission of Control, with its seat at Sofia. In some respects the
Bulgarian Inter-Ally Commission appears to have powers and authority
independent of the Reparation Commission, but it is to act,
nevertheless, as the agent of the latter, and is authorized to tender
advice to the Reparation Commission as to, for example, the reduction of
the half-yearly instalments.

[137] Under the Treaty this is the function of any body
appointed for the purpose by the principal Allied and Associated
Governments, and not necessarily of the Reparation Commission. But it
may be presumed that no second body will be established for this special
purpose.

[138] At the date of writing no treaties with these countries
have been drafted. It is possible that Turkey might be dealt with by a
separate Commission.

[139] This appears to me to be in effect the position (if this
paragraph means anything at all), in spite of the following disclaimer
of such intentions in the Allies' reply:--"Nor does Paragraph 12(b) of
Annex II. give the Commission powers to prescribe or enforce taxes or to
dictate the character of the German budget."

[140] Whatever that may mean.

[141] Assuming that the capital sum is discharged evenly over a
period as short as thirty-three years, this has the effect of _halving_
the burden as compared with the payments required on the basis of 5 per
cent interest on the outstanding capital.

[142] I forbear to outline the further details of the German
offer as the above are the essential points.

[143] For this reason it is not strictly comparable with my
estimate of Germany's capacity in an earlier section of this chapter,
which estimate is on the basis of Germany's condition as it will be when
the rest of the Treaty has come into effect.

[144] Owing to delays on the part of the Allies in ratifying
the Treaty, the Reparation Commission had not yet been formally
constituted by the end of October, 1919. So far as I am aware,
therefore, nothing has been done to make the above offer effective. But,
perhaps in view of the circumstances, there has been an extension of the
date.




CHAPTER VI

EUROPE AFTER THE TREATY


This chapter must be one of pessimism. The Treaty includes no provisions
for the economic rehabilitation of Europe,--nothing to make the defeated
Central Empires into good neighbors, nothing to stabilize the new States
of Europe, nothing to reclaim Russia; nor does it promote in any way a
compact of economic solidarity amongst the Allies themselves; no
arrangement was reached at Paris for restoring the disordered finances
of France and Italy, or to adjust the systems of the Old World and the
New.

The Council of Four paid no attention to these issues, being preoccupied
with others,--Clemenceau to crush the economic life of his enemy, Lloyd
George to do a deal and bring home something which would pass muster for
a week, the President to do nothing that was not just and right. It is
an extraordinary fact that the fundamental economic problems of a Europe
starving and disintegrating before their eyes, was the one question in
which it was impossible to arouse the interest of the Four. Reparation
was their main excursion into the economic field, and they settled it
as a problem of theology, of polities, of electoral chicane, from every
point of view except that of the economic future of the States whose
destiny they were handling.

I leave, from this point onwards, Paris, the Conference, and the Treaty,
briefly to consider the present situation of Europe, as the War and the
Peace have made it; and it will no longer be part of my purpose to
distinguish between the inevitable fruits of the War and the avoidable
misfortunes of the Peace.

The essential facts of the situation, as I see them, are expressed
simply. Europe consists of the densest aggregation of population in the
history of the world. This population is accustomed to a relatively high
standard of life, in which, even now, some sections of it anticipate
improvement rather than deterioration. In relation to other continents
Europe is not self-sufficient; in particular it cannot feed Itself.
Internally the population is not evenly distributed, but much of it is
crowded into a relatively small number of dense industrial centers. This
population secured for itself a livelihood before the war, without much
margin of surplus, by means of a delicate and immensely complicated
organization, of which the foundations were supported by coal, iron,
transport, and an unbroken supply of imported food and raw materials
from other continents. By the destruction of this organization and the
interruption of the stream of supplies, a part of this population is
deprived of its means of livelihood. Emigration is not open to the
redundant surplus. For it would take years to transport them overseas,
even, which is not the case, if countries could be found which were
ready to receive them. The danger confronting us, therefore, is the
rapid depression of the standard of life of the European populations to
a point which will mean actual starvation for some (a point already
reached in Russia and approximately reached in Austria). Men will not
always die quietly. For starvation, which brings to some lethargy and a
helpless despair, drives other temperaments to the nervous instability
of hysteria and to a mad despair. And these in their distress may
overturn the remnants of organization, and submerge civilization itself
in their attempts to satisfy desperately the overwhelming needs of the
individual. This is the danger against which all our resources and
courage and idealism must now co-operate.

On the 13th May, 1919, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau addressed to the Peace
Conference of the Allied and Associated Powers the Report of the German
Economic Commission charged with the study of the effect of the
conditions of Peace on the situation of the German population. "In the
course of the last two generations," they reported, "Germany has become
transformed from an agricultural State to an industrial State. So long
as she was an agricultural State, Germany could feed forty million
inhabitants. As an industrial State she could insure the means of
subsistence for a population of sixty-seven millions; and in 1913 the
importation of foodstuffs amounted, in round figures, to twelve million
tons. Before the war a total of fifteen million persons in Germany
provided for their existence by foreign trade, navigation, and the use,
directly or indirectly, of foreign raw material." After rehearsing the
main relevant provisions of the Peace Treaty the report continues:
"After this diminution of her products, after the economic depression
resulting from the loss of her colonies, her merchant fleet and her
foreign investments, Germany will not be in a position to import from
abroad an adequate quantity of raw material. An enormous part of German
industry will, therefore, be condemned inevitably to destruction. The
need of importing foodstuffs will increase considerably at the same time
that the possibility of satisfying this demand is as greatly diminished.
In a very short time, therefore, Germany will not be in a position to
give bread and work to her numerous millions of inhabitants, who are
prevented from earning their livelihood by navigation and trade. These
persons should emigrate, but this is a material impossibility, all the
more because many countries and the most important ones will oppose any
German immigration. To put the Peace conditions into execution would
logically involve, therefore, the loss of several millions of persons in
Germany. This catastrophe would not be long in coming about, seeing that
the health of the population has been broken down during the War by the
Blockade, and during the Armistice by the aggravation of the Blockade of
famine. No help, however great, or over however long a period it were
continued, could prevent those deaths _en masse_." "We do not know, and
indeed we doubt," the report concludes, "whether the Delegates of the
Allied and Associated Powers realize the inevitable consequences which
will take place if Germany, an industrial State, very thickly populated,
closely bound up with the economic system of the world, and under the
necessity of importing enormous quantities of raw material and
foodstuffs, suddenly finds herself pushed back to the phase of her
development, which corresponds to her economic condition and the numbers
of her population as they were half a century ago. Those who sign this
Treaty will sign the death sentence of many millions of German men,
women and children."

I know of no adequate answer to these words. The indictment is at least
as true of the Austrian, as of the German, settlement. This is the
fundamental problem in front of us, before which questions of
territorial adjustment and the balance of European power are
insignificant. Some of the catastrophes of past history, which have
thrown back human progress for centuries, have been due to the reactions
following on the sudden termination, whether in the course of nature or
by the act of man, of temporarily favorable conditions which have
permitted the growth of population beyond what could be provided for
when the favorable conditions were at an end.

The significant features of the immediate situation can be grouped under
three heads: first, the absolute falling off, for the time being, in
Europe's internal productivity; second, the breakdown of transport and
exchange by means of which its products could be conveyed where they
were most wanted; and third, the inability of Europe to purchase its
usual supplies from overseas.

The decrease of productivity cannot be easily estimated, and may be the
subject of exaggeration. But the _primâ facie_ evidence of it is
overwhelming, and this factor has been the main burden of Mr. Hoover's
well-considered warnings. A variety of causes have produced it;—violent
and prolonged internal disorder as in Russia and Hungary; the creation
of new governments and their inexperience in the readjustment of
economic relations, as in Poland and Czecho-Slovakia; the loss
throughout the Continent of efficient labor, through the casualties of
war or the continuance of mobilization; the falling-off in efficiency
through continued underfeeding in the Central Empires; the exhaustion
of the soil from lack of the usual applications of artificial manures
throughout the course of the war; the unsettlement of the minds of the
laboring classes on the fundamental economic issues of their lives. But
above all (to quote Mr. Hoover), "there is a great relaxation of effort
as the reflex of physical exhaustion of large sections of the
population from privation and the mental and physical strain of the
war." Many persons are for one reason or another out of employment
altogether. According to Mr. Hoover, a summary of the unemployment
bureaus in Europe in July, 1919, showed that 15,000,000 families were
receiving unemployment allowances in one form or another, and were
being paid in the main by a constant inflation of currency. In Germany
there is the added deterrent to labor and to capital (in so far as the
Reparation terms are taken literally), that anything, which they may
produce beyond the barest level of subsistence, will for years to come
be taken away from them.

Such definite data as we possess do not add much, perhaps, to the
general picture of decay. But I will remind the reader of one or two of
them. The coal production of Europe as a whole is estimated to have
fallen off by 30 per cent; and upon coal the greater part of the
industries of Europe and the whole of her transport system depend.
Whereas before the war Germany produced 85 per cent of the total food
consumed by her inhabitants, the productivity of the soil is now
diminished by 40 per cent and the effective quality of the live-stock by
55 per cent.[145] Of the European countries which formerly possessed a
large exportable surplus, Russia, as much by reason of deficient
transport as of diminished output, may herself starve. Hungary, apart
from her other troubles, has been pillaged by the Romanians immediately
after harvest. Austria will have consumed the whole of her own harvest
for 1919 before the end of the calendar year. The figures are almost too
overwhelming to carry conviction to our minds; if they were not quite so
bad, our effective belief in them might be stronger.

But even when coal can be got and grain harvested, the breakdown of the
European railway system prevents their carriage; and even when goods can
be manufactured, the breakdown of the European currency system prevents
their sale. I have already described the losses, by war and under the
Armistice surrenders, to the transport system of Germany. But even so,
Germany's position, taking account of her power of replacement by
manufacture, is probably not so serious as that of some of her
neighbors. In Russia (about which, however, we have very little exact or
accurate information) the condition of the rolling-stock is believed to
be altogether desperate, and one of the most fundamental factors in her
existing economic disorder. And in Poland, Roumania, and Hungary the
position is not much better. Yet modern industrial life essentially
depends on efficient transport facilities, and the population which
secured its livelihood by these means cannot continue to live without
them. The breakdown of currency, and the distrust in its purchasing
value, is an aggravation of these evils which must be discussed in a
little more detail in connection with foreign trade.

What then is our picture of Europe? A country population able to support
life on the fruits of its own agricultural production but without the
accustomed surplus for the towns, and also (as a result of the lack of
imported materials and so of variety and amount in the saleable
manufactures of the towns) without the usual incentives to market food
in return for other wares; an industrial population unable to keep its
strength for lack of food, unable to earn a livelihood for lack of
materials, and so unable to make good by imports from abroad the failure
of productivity at home. Yet, according to Mr. Hoover, "a rough estimate
would indicate that the population of Europe is at least 100,000,000
greater than can be supported without imports, and must live by the
production and distribution of exports."

The problem of the re-inauguration of the perpetual circle of production
and exchange in foreign trade leads me to a necessary digression on the
currency situation of Europe.

Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the
Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process
of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an
important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not
only confiscate, but they confiscate _arbitrarily_; and, while the
process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this
arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at
confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those
to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even
beyond their expectations or desires, become "profiteers,", who are the
object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has
impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation
proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from
month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors,
which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly
disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of
wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.

Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of
overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of
destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is
able to diagnose.

In the latter stages of the war all the belligerent governments
practised, from necessity or incompetence, what a Bolshevist might have
done from design. Even now, when the war is over, most of them continue
out of weakness the same malpractices. But further, the Governments of
Europe, being many of them at this moment reckless in their methods as
well as weak, seek to direct on to a class known as "profiteers" the
popular indignation against the more obvious consequences of their
vicious methods. These "profiteers" are, broadly speaking, the
entrepreneur class of capitalists, that is to say, the active and
constructive element in the whole capitalist society, who in a period of
rapidly rising prices cannot help but get rich quick whether they wish
it or desire it or not. If prices are continually rising, every trader
who has purchased for stock or owns property and plant inevitably makes
profits. By directing hatred against this class, therefore, the European
Governments are carrying a step further the fatal process which the
subtle mind of Lenin had consciously conceived. The profiteers are a
consequence and not a cause of rising prices. By combining a popular
hatred of the class of entrepreneurs with the blow already given to
social security by the violent and arbitrary disturbance of contract and
of the established equilibrium of wealth which is the inevitable result
of inflation, these Governments are fast rendering impossible a
continuance of the social and economic order of the nineteenth century.
But they have no plan for replacing it.

We are thus faced in Europe with the spectacle of an extraordinary
weakness on the part of the great capitalist class, which has emerged
from the industrial triumphs of the nineteenth century, and seemed a
very few years ago our all-powerful master. The terror and personal
timidity of the individuals of this class is now so great, their
confidence in their place in society and in their necessity to the
social organism so diminished, that they are the easy victims of
intimidation. This was not so in England twenty-five years ago, any
more than it is now in the United States. Then the capitalists believed
in themselves, in their value to society, in the propriety of their
continued existence in the full enjoyment of their riches and the
unlimited exercise of their power. Now they tremble before every
insult;--call them pro-Germans, international financiers, or profiteers,
and they will give you any ransom you choose to ask not to speak of them
so harshly. They allow themselves to be ruined and altogether undone by
their own instruments, governments of their own making, and a press of
which they are the proprietors. Perhaps it is historically true that no
order of society ever perishes save by its own hand. In the complexer
world of Western Europe the Immanent Will may achieve its ends more
subtly and bring in the revolution no less inevitably through a Klotz or
a George than by the intellectualisms, too ruthless and self-conscious
for us, of the bloodthirsty philosophers of Russia.

The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to
extraordinary lengths. The various belligerent Governments, unable, or
too timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the
resources they required, have printed notes for the balance. In Russia
and Austria-Hungary this process has reached a point where for the
purposes of foreign trade the currency is practically valueless. The
Polish mark can be bought for about three cents and the Austrian crown
for less than two cents, but they cannot be sold at all. The German mark
is worth less than four cents on the exchanges. In most of the other
countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the real position is
nearly as bad. The currency of Italy has fallen to little more than a
half of its nominal value in spite of its being still subject to some
degree of regulation; French currency maintains an uncertain market; and
even sterling is seriously diminished in present value and impaired in
its future prospects.

But while these currencies enjoy a precarious value abroad, they have
never entirely lost, not even in Russia, their purchasing power at home.
A sentiment of trust in the legal money of the State is so deeply
implanted in the citizens of all countries that they cannot but believe
that some day this money must recover a part at least of its former
value. To their minds it appears that value is inherent in money as
such, and they do not apprehend that the real wealth, which this money
might have stood for, has been dissipated once and for all. This
sentiment is supported by the various legal regulations with which the
Governments endeavor to control internal prices, and so to preserve some
purchasing power for their legal tender. Thus the force of law
preserves a measure of immediate purchasing power over some commodities
and the force of sentiment and custom maintains, especially amongst
peasants, a willingness to hoard paper which is really worthless.

The presumption of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of
law expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however,
the seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of
ultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his
labors for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to
purchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has
received for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself,
dispose of it to his friends and neighbors as a favor, or relax his
efforts in producing it. A system of compelling the exchange of
commodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes
production, but leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter.
If, however, a government refrains from regulation and allows matters to
take their course, essential commodities soon attain a level of price
out of the reach of all but the rich, the worthlessness of the money
becomes apparent, and the fraud upon the public can be concealed no
longer.

The effect on foreign trade of price-regulation and profiteer-hunting
as cures for inflation is even worse. Whatever may be the case at home,
the currency must soon reach its real level abroad, with the result that
prices inside and outside the country lose their normal adjustment. The
price of imported commodities, when converted at the current rate of
exchange, is far in excess of the local price, so that many essential
goods will not be imported at all by private agency, and must be
provided by the government, which, in re-selling the goods below cost
price, plunges thereby a little further into insolvency. The bread
subsidies, now almost universal throughout Europe, are the leading
example of this phenomenon.

The countries of Europe fall into two distinct groups at the present
time as regards their manifestations of what is really the same evil
throughout, according as they have been cut off from international
intercourse by the Blockade, or have had their imports paid for out of
the resources of their allies. I take Germany as typical of the first,
and France and Italy of the second.

The note circulation of Germany is about ten times[146] what it was
before the war. The value of the mark in terms of gold is about
one-eighth of its former value. As world-prices in terms of gold are
more than double what they were, it follows that mark-prices inside
Germany ought to be from sixteen to twenty times their pre-war level if
they are to be in adjustment and proper conformity with prices outside
Germany.[147] But this is not the case. In spite of a very great rise in
German prices, they probably do not yet average much more than five
times their former level, so far as staple commodities are concerned;
and it is impossible that they should rise further except with a
simultaneous and not less violent adjustment of the level of money
wages. The existing maladjustment hinders in two ways (apart from other
obstacles) that revival of the import trade which is the essential
preliminary of the economic reconstruction of the country. In the first
place, imported commodities are beyond the purchasing power of the great
mass of the population,[148] and the flood of imports which might have
been expected to succeed the raising of the blockade was not in fact
commercially possible.[149] In the second place, it is a hazardous
enterprise for a merchant or a manufacturer to purchase with a foreign
credit material for which, when he has imported it or manufactured it,
he will receive mark currency of a quite uncertain and possibly
unrealizable value. This latter obstacle to the revival of trade is one
which easily escapes notice and deserves a little attention. It is
impossible at the present time to say what the mark will be worth in
terms of foreign currency three or six months or a year hence, and the
exchange market can quote no reliable figure. It may be the case,
therefore, that a German merchant, careful of his future credit and
reputation, who is actually offered a short period credit in terms of
sterling or dollars, may be reluctant and doubtful whether to accept it.
He will owe sterling or dollars, but he will sell his product for marks,
and his power, when the time comes, to turn these marks into the
currency in which he has to repay his debt is entirely problematic.
Business loses its genuine character and becomes no better than a
speculation in the exchanges, the fluctuations in which entirely
obliterate the normal profits of commerce.

There are therefore three separate obstacles to the revival of trade: a
maladjustment between internal prices and international prices, a lack
of individual credit abroad wherewith to buy the raw materials needed to
secure the working capital and to re-start the circle of exchange, and a
disordered currency system which renders credit operations hazardous or
impossible quite apart from the ordinary risks of commerce.

The note circulation of France is more than six times its pre-war level.
The exchange value of the franc in terms of gold is a little less than
two-thirds its former value; that is to say, the value of the franc has
not fallen in proportion to the increased volume of the currency.[150]
This apparently superior situation of France is due to the fact that
until recently a very great part of her imports have not been paid for,
but have been covered by loans from the Governments of Great Britain and
the United States. This has allowed a want of equilibrium between
exports and imports to be established, which is becoming a very serious
factor, now that the outside assistance is being gradually discontinued.
The internal economy of France and its price level in relation to the
note circulation and the foreign exchanges is at present based on an
excess of imports over exports which cannot possibly continue. Yet it is
difficult to see how the position can be readjusted except by a lowering
of the standard of consumption in France, which, even if it is only
temporary, will provoke a great deal of discontent.[151]

The situation of Italy is not very different. There the note circulation
is five or six times its pre-war level, and the exchange value of the
lira in terms of gold about half its former value. Thus the adjustment
of the exchange to the volume of the note circulation has proceeded
further in Italy than in France. On the other hand, Italy's "invisible"
receipts, from emigrant remittances and the expenditure of tourists,
have been very injuriously affected; the disruption of Austria has
deprived her of an important market; and her peculiar dependence on
foreign shipping and on imported raw materials of every kind has laid
her open to special injury from the increase of world prices. For all
these reasons her position is grave, and her excess of imports as
serious a symptom as in the case of France.[152]

The existing inflation and the maladjustment of international trade are
aggravated, both in France and in Italy, by the unfortunate budgetary
position of the Governments of these countries.

In France the failure to impose taxation is notorious. Before the war
the aggregate French and British budgets, and also the average taxation
per head, were about equal; but in France no substantial effort has been
made to cover the increased expenditure. "Taxes increased in Great
Britain during the war," it has been estimated, "from 95 francs per head
to 265 francs, whereas the increase in France was only from 90 to 103
francs." The taxation voted in France for the financial year ending June
30, 1919, was less than half the estimated normal _post-bellum_
expenditure. The normal budget for the future cannot be put below
$4,400,000,000 (22 milliard francs), and may exceed this figure; but
even for the fiscal year 1919-20 the estimated receipts from taxation
do not cover much more than half this amount. The French Ministry of
Finance have no plan or policy whatever for meeting this prodigious
deficit, except the expectation of receipts from Germany on a scale
which the French officials themselves know to be baseless. In the
meantime they are helped by sales of war material and surplus American
stocks and do not scruple, even in the latter half of 1919, to meet the
deficit by the yet further expansion of the note issue of the Bank of
France.[153]

The budgetary position of Italy is perhaps a little superior to that of
France. Italian finance throughout the war was more enterprising than
the French, and far greater efforts were made to impose taxation and pay
for the war. Nevertheless Signor Nitti, the Prime Minister, in a letter
addressed to the electorate on the eve of the General Election (Oct.,
1919), thought it necessary to make public the following desperate
analysis of the situation:--(1) The State expenditure amounts to about
three times the revenue. (2) All the industrial undertakings of the
State, including the railways, telegraphs, and telephones, are being run
at a loss. Although the public is buying bread at a high price, that
price represents a loss to the Government of about a milliard a year.
(3) Exports now leaving the country are valued at only one-quarter or
one-fifth of the imports from abroad. (4) The National Debt is
increasing by about a milliard lire per month. (5) The military
expenditure for one month is still larger than that for the first year
of the war.

But if this is the budgetary position of France and Italy, that of the
rest of belligerent Europe is yet more desperate. In Germany the total
expenditure of the Empire, the Federal States, and the Communes in
1919-20 is estimated at 25 milliards of marks, of which not above 10
milliards are covered by previously existing taxation. This is without
allowing anything for the payment of the indemnity. In Russia, Poland,
Hungary, or Austria such a thing as a budget cannot be seriously
considered to exist at all.[154]

Thus the menace of inflationism described above is not merely a product
of the war, of which peace begins the cure. It is a continuing
phenomenon of which the end is not yet in sight.

All these influences combine not merely to prevent Europe from
supplying immediately a sufficient stream of exports to pay for the
goods she needs to import, but they impair her credit for securing the
working capital required to re-start the circle of exchange and also, by
swinging the forces of economic law yet further from equilibrium rather
than towards it, they favor a continuance of the present conditions
instead of a recovery from them. An inefficient, unemployed,
disorganized Europe faces us, torn by internal strife and international
hate, fighting, starving, pillaging, and lying. What warrant is there
for a picture of less somber colors?

I have paid little heed in this book to Russia, Hungary, or
Austria.[155] There the miseries of life and the disintegration of
society are too notorious to require analysis; and these countries are
already experiencing the actuality of what for the rest of Europe is
still in the realm of prediction. Yet they comprehend a vast territory
and a great population, and are an extant example of how much man can
suffer and how far society can decay. Above all, they are the signal to
us of how in the final catastrophe the malady of the body passes over
into malady of the mind. Economic privation proceeds by easy stages, and
so long as men suffer it patiently the outside world cares little.
Physical efficiency and resistance to disease slowly diminish,[156] but
life proceeds somehow, until the limit of human endurance is reached at
last and counsels of despair and madness stir the sufferers from the
lethargy which precedes the crisis. Then man shakes himself, and the
bonds of custom are loosed. The power of ideas is sovereign, and he
listens to whatever instruction of hope, illusion, or revenge is carried
to him on the air. As I write, the flames of Russian Bolshevism seem,
for the moment at least, to have burnt themselves out, and the peoples
of Central and Eastern Europe are held in a dreadful torpor. The lately
gathered harvest keeps off the worst privations, and Peace has been
declared at Paris. But winter approaches. Men will have nothing to look
forward to or to nourish hopes on. There will be little fuel to moderate
the rigors of the season or to comfort the starved bodies of the
town-dwellers.

But who can say how much is endurable, or in what direction men will
seek at last to escape from their misfortunes?

stimulate exports and so cure itself. But in Germany, and still more in
Poland and Austria, there is little or nothing to export. There must be
imports _before_ there can be exports.

[150] Allowing for the diminished value of gold, the exchange
value of the franc should be less than 40 per cent of its previous
value, instead of the actual figure of about 60 per cent, if the fall
were proportional to the increase in the volume of the currency.

[151] How very far from equilibrium France's international
exchange now is can be seen from the following table:

                                             Excess of
      Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports
      Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000

              1913     140,355     114,670      25,685
              1914     106,705      81,145      25,560
              1918     331,915      69,055     262,860
    Jan.-Mar. 1919     387,140      66,670     320,470
    Apr.-June 1919     421,410      83,895     337,515
         July 1919     467,565     123,675     343,890

These figures have been converted, at approximately par rates, but this
is roughly compensated by the fact that the trade of 1918 and 1919 has
been valued at 1917 official rates. French imports cannot possibly
continue at anything approaching these figures, and the semblance of
prosperity based on such a state of affairs is spurious.

[152] The figures for Italy are as follows:

                                             Excess of
      Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports
      Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000

              1913      60,760      41,860      18,900
              1914      48,720      36,840      11,880
              1918     235,025      41,390     193,635
    Jan.-Mar. 1919     229,240      38,685     191,155
    Apr.-June 1919     331,035      69,250     261,785
    July-Aug. 1919     223,535      84,515     139,020

[153] In the last two returns of the Bank of France available
as I write (Oct. 2 and 9, 1919) the increases in the note issue on the
week amounted to $93,750,000 and $94,125,000 respectively.

[154] On October 3, 1919, M. Bilinski made his financial
statement to the Polish Diet. He estimated his expenditure for the next
nine months at rather more than double his expenditure for the past nine
months, and while during the first period his revenue had amounted to
one-fifth of his expenditure, for the coming months he was budgeting for
receipts equal to one-eighth of his outgoings. The _Times_ correspondent
at Warsaw reported that "in general M. Bilinski's tone was optimistic
and appeared to satisfy his audience."

[155] The terms of the Peace Treaty imposed on the Austrian
Republic bear no relation to the real facts of that State's desperate
situation. The _Arbeiter Zeitung_ of Vienna on June 4, 1919, commented
on them as follows: "Never has the substance of a treaty of peace so
grossly betrayed the intentions which were said to have guided its
construction as is the case with this Treaty ... in which every provision
is permeated with ruthlessness and pitilessness, in which no breath of
human sympathy can be detected, which flies in the face of everything
which binds man to man, which is a crime against humanity itself,
against a suffering and tortured people." I am acquainted in detail with
the Austrian Treaty and I was present when some of its terms were being
drafted, but I do not find it easy to rebut the justice of this
outburst.

[156] For months past the reports of the health conditions in
the Central Empires have been of such a character that the imagination
is dulled, and one almost seems guilty of sentimentality in quoting
them. But their general veracity is not disputed, and I quote the three
following, that the reader may not be unmindful of them: "In the last
years of the war, in Austria alone at least 35,000 people died of
tuberculosis, in Vienna alone 12,000. Today we have to reckon with a
number of at least 350,000 to 400,000 people who require treatment for
tuberculosis.... As the result of malnutrition a bloodless generation is
growing up with undeveloped muscles, undeveloped joints, and undeveloped
brain" (_Neue Freie Presse_, May 31, 1919). The Commission of Doctors
appointed by the Medical Faculties of Holland, Sweden, and Norway to
examine the conditions in Germany reported as follows in the Swedish
Press in April, 1919: "Tuberculosis, especially in children, is
increasing in an appalling way, and, generally speaking, is malignant.
In the same way rickets is more serious and more widely prevalent. It is
impossible to do anything for these diseases; there is no milk for the
tuberculous, and no cod-liver oil for those suffering from rickets....
Tuberculosis is assuming almost unprecedented aspects, such as have
hitherto only been known in exceptional cases. The whole body is
attacked simultaneously, and the illness in this form is practically
incurable.... Tuberculosis is nearly always fatal now among adults. It
is the cause of 90 per cent of the hospital cases. Nothing can be done
against it owing to lack of food-stuffs.... It appears in the most
terrible forms, such as glandular tuberculosis, which turns into
purulent dissolution." The following is by a writer in the _Vossische
Zeitung_, June 5, 1919, who accompanied the Hoover Mission to the
Erzgebirge: "I visited large country districts where 90 per cent of all
the children were ricketty and where children of three years are only
beginning to walk.... Accompany me to a school in the Erzgebirge. You
think it is a kindergarten for the little ones. No, these are children
of seven and eight years. Tiny faces, with large dull eyes, overshadowed
by huge puffed, ricketty foreheads, their small arms just skin and bone,
and above the crooked legs with their dislocated joints the swollen,
pointed stomachs of the hunger œdema.... 'You see this child here,' the
physician in charge explained; 'it consumed an incredible amount of
bread, and yet did not get any stronger. I found out that it hid all the
bread it received underneath its straw mattress. The fear of hunger was
so deeply rooted in the child that it collected stores instead of eating
the food: a misguided animal instinct made the dread of hunger worse
than the actual pangs.'" Yet there are many persons apparently in whose
opinion justice requires that such beings should pay tribute until they
are forty or fifty years of age in relief of the British taxpayer.




CHAPTER VII

REMEDIES


It is difficult to maintain true perspective in large affairs. I have
criticized the work of Paris, and have depicted in somber colors the
condition and the prospects of Europe. This is one aspect of the
position and, I believe, a true one. But in so complex a phenomenon the
prognostics do not all point one way; and we may make the error of
expecting consequences to follow too swiftly and too inevitably from
what perhaps are not _all_ the relevant causes. The blackness of the
prospect itself leads us to doubt its accuracy; our imagination is
dulled rather than stimulated by too woeful a narration, and our minds
rebound from what is felt "too bad to be true." But before the reader
allows himself to be too much swayed by these natural reflections, and
before I lead him, as is the intention of this chapter, towards remedies
and ameliorations and the discovery of happier tendencies, let him
redress the balance of his thought by recalling two contrasts--England
and Russia, of which the one may encourage his optimism too much, but
the other should remind him that catastrophes can still happen, and
that modern society is not immune from the very greatest evils.

In the chapters of this book I have not generally had in mind the
situation or the problems of England. "Europe" in my narration must
generally be interpreted to exclude the British Isles. England is in a
state of transition, and her economic problems are serious. We may be on
the eve of great changes in her social and industrial structure. Some of
us may welcome such prospects and some of us deplore them. But they are
of a different kind altogether from those impending on Europe. I do not
perceive in England the slightest possibility of catastrophe or any
serious likelihood of a general upheaval of society. The war has
impoverished us, but not seriously;--I should judge that the real wealth
of the country in 1919 is at least equal to what it was in 1900. Our
balance of trade is adverse, but not so much so that the readjustment of
it need disorder our economic life.[157] The deficit in our Budget is
large, but not beyond what firm and prudent statesmanship could bridge.
The shortening of the hours of labor may have somewhat diminished our
productivity. But it should not be too much to hope that this is a
feature of transition, and no one who is acquainted with the British
workingman can doubt that, if it suits him, and if he is in sympathy and
reasonable contentment with the conditions of his life, he can produce
at least as much in a shorter working day as he did in the longer hours
which prevailed formerly. The most serious problems for England have
been brought to a head by the war, but are in their origins more
fundamental. The forces of the nineteenth century have run their course
and are exhausted. The economic motives and ideals of that generation no
longer satisfy us: we must find a new way and must suffer again the
_malaise_, and finally the pangs, of a new industrial birth. This is one
element. The other is that on which I have enlarged in Chapter II.;--the
increase in the real cost of food and the diminishing response of nature
to any further increase in the population of the world, a tendency which
must be especially injurious to the greatest of all industrial
countries and the most dependent on imported supplies of food.

But these secular problems are such as no age is free from. They are of
an altogether different order from those which may afflict the peoples
of Central Europe. Those readers who, chiefly mindful of the British
conditions with which they are familiar, are apt to indulge their
optimism, and still more those whose immediate environment is American,
must cast their minds to Russia, Turkey, Hungary, or Austria, where the
most dreadful material evils which men can suffer--famine, cold,
disease, war, murder, and anarchy--are an actual present experience, if
they are to apprehend the character of the misfortunes against the
further extension of which it must surely be our duty to seek the
remedy, if there is one.

What then is to be done? The tentative suggestions of this chapter may
appear to the reader inadequate. But the opportunity was missed at Paris
during the six months which followed the Armistice, and nothing we can
do now can repair the mischief wrought at that time. Great privation and
great risks to society have become unavoidable. All that is now open to
us is to redirect, so far as lies in our power, the fundamental economic
tendencies which underlie the events of the hour, so that they promote
the re-establishment of prosperity and order, instead of leading us
deeper into misfortune.

We must first escape from the atmosphere and the methods of Paris. Those
who controlled the Conference may bow before the gusts of popular
opinion, but they will never lead us out of our troubles. It is hardly
to be supposed that the Council of Four can retrace their steps, even if
they wished to do so. The replacement of the existing Governments of
Europe is, therefore, an almost indispensable preliminary.

I propose then to discuss a program, for those who believe that the
Peace of Versailles cannot stand, under the following heads:

1. The Revision of the Treaty.

2. The settlement of inter-Ally indebtedness.

3. An international loan and the reform of the currency.

4. The relations of Central Europe to Russia.


1. _The Revision of the Treaty_

Are any constitutional means open to us for altering the Treaty?
President Wilson and General Smuts, who believe that to have secured the
Covenant of the League of Nations outweighs much evil in the rest of the
Treaty, have indicated that we must look to the League for the gradual
evolution of a more tolerable life for Europe. "There are territorial
settlements," General Smuts wrote in his statement on signing the Peace
Treaty, "which will need revision. There are guarantees laid down which
we all hope will soon be found out of harmony with the new peaceful
temper and unarmed state of our former enemies. There are punishments
foreshadowed over most of which a calmer mood may yet prefer to pass the
sponge of oblivion. There are indemnities stipulated which cannot be
enacted without grave injury to the industrial revival of Europe, and
which it will be in the interests of all to render more tolerable and
moderate.... I am confident that the League of Nations will yet prove
the path of escape for Europe out of the ruin brought about by this
war." Without the League, President Wilson informed the Senate when he
presented the Treaty to them early in July, 1919, "...long-continued
supervision of the task of reparation which Germany was to undertake to
complete within the next generation might entirely break down;[158] the
reconsideration and revision of administrative arrangements and
restrictions which the Treaty prescribed, but which it recognized might
not provide lasting advantage or be entirely fair if too long enforced,
would be impracticable."

Can we look forward with fair hopes to securing from the operation of
the League those benefits which two of its principal begetters thus
encourage us to expect from it? The relevant passage is to be found in
Article XIX. of the Covenant, which runs as follows:

    "The Assembly may from time to time advise the
    reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which
    have become inapplicable and the consideration of
    international conditions whose continuance might endanger the
    peace of the world."

But alas! Article V. provides that "Except where otherwise expressly
provided in this Covenant or by the terms of the present Treaty,
decisions at any meeting of the Assembly or of the Council shall require
the agreement of all the Members of the League represented at the
meeting." Does not this provision reduce the League, so far as concerns
an early reconsideration of any of the terms of the Peace Treaty, into a
body merely for wasting time? If all the parties to the Treaty are
unanimously of opinion that it requires alteration in a particular
sense, it does not need a League and a Covenant to put the business
through. Even when the Assembly of the League is unanimous it can only
"advise" reconsideration by the members specially affected.

But the League will operate, say its supporters, by its influence on the
public opinion of the world, and the view of the majority will carry
decisive weight in practice, even though constitutionally it is of no
effect. Let us pray that this be so. Yet the League in the hands of the
trained European diplomatist may become an unequaled instrument for
obstruction and delay. The revision of Treaties is entrusted primarily,
not to the Council, which meets frequently, but to the Assembly, which
will meet more rarely and must become, as any one with an experience of
large Inter-Ally Conferences must know, an unwieldy polyglot debating
society in which the greatest resolution and the best management may
fail altogether to bring issues to a head against an opposition in favor
of the _status quo_. There are indeed two disastrous blots on the
Covenant,--Article V., which prescribes unanimity, and the
much-criticized Article X., by which "The Members of the League
undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the
territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members
of the League." These two Articles together go some way to destroy the
conception of the League as an instrument of progress, and to equip it
from the outset with an almost fatal bias towards the _status quo_. It
is these Articles which have reconciled to the League some of its
original opponents, who now hope to make of it another Holy Alliance for
the perpetuation of the economic ruin of their enemies and the Balance
of Power in their own interests which they believe themselves to have
established by the Peace.

But while it would be wrong and foolish to conceal from ourselves in the
interests of "idealism" the real difficulties of the position in the
special matter of revising treaties, that is no reason for any of us to
decry the League, which the wisdom of the world may yet transform into a
powerful instrument of peace, and which in Articles XI.-XVII.[159] has
already accomplished a great and beneficent achievement. I agree,
therefore, that our first efforts for the Revision of the Treaty must be
made through the League rather than in any other way, in the hope that
the force of general opinion and, if necessary, the use of financial
pressure and financial inducements, may be enough to prevent a
recalcitrant minority from exercising their right of veto. We must trust
the new Governments, whose existence I premise in the principal Allied
countries, to show a profounder wisdom and a greater magnanimity than
their predecessors.

We have seen in Chapters IV. and V. that there are numerous particulars
in which the Treaty is objectionable. I do not intend to enter here into
details, or to attempt a revision of the Treaty clause by clause. I
limit myself to three great changes which are necessary for the economic
life of Europe, relating to Reparation, to Coal and Iron, and to
Tariffs.

_Reparation_.--If the sum demanded for Reparation is less than what the
Allies are entitled to on a strict interpretation of their engagements,
it is unnecessary to particularize the items it represents or to hear
arguments about its compilation. I suggest, therefore, the following
settlement:--

(1) The amount of the payment to be made by Germany in respect of
Reparation and the costs of the Armies of Occupation might be fixed at
$10,000,000,000.

(2) The surrender of merchant ships and submarine cables under the
Treaty, of war material under the Armistice, of State property in ceded
territory, of claims against such territory in respect of public debt,
and of Germany's claims against her former Allies, should be reckoned as
worth the lump sum of $2,500,000,000, without any attempt being made to
evaluate them item by item.

(3) The balance of $7,500,000,000 should not carry interest pending its
repayment, and should be paid by Germany in thirty annual instalments of
$250,000,000, beginning in 1923.

(4) The Reparation Commission should be dissolved, or, if any duties
remain for it to perform, it should become an appanage of the League of
Nations and should include representatives of Germany and of the neutral
States.

(5) Germany would be left to meet the annual instalments in such manner
as she might see fit, any complaint against her for non-fulfilment of
her obligations being lodged with the League of Nations. That is to say,
there would be no further expropriation of German private property
abroad, except so far as is required to meet private German obligations
out of the proceeds of such property already liquidated or in the hands
of Public Trustees and Enemy Property Custodians in the Allied countries
and in the United States; and, in particular, Article 260 (which
provides for the expropriation of German interests in public utility
enterprises) would be abrogated.

(6) No attempt should be made to extract Reparation payments from
Austria.

_Coal and Iron_.--(1) The Allies' options on coal under Annex V. should
be abandoned, but Germany's obligation to make good France's loss of
coal through the destruction of her mines should remain. That is to say,
Germany should undertake "to deliver to France annually for a period not
exceeding ten years an amount of coal equal to the difference between
the annual production before the war of the coal mines of the Nord and
Pas de Calais, destroyed as a result of the war, and the production of
the mines of the same area during the years in question; such delivery
not to exceed twenty million tons in any one year of the first five
years, and eight million tons in any one year of the succeeding five
years." This obligation should lapse, nevertheless, in the event of the
coal districts of Upper Silesia being taken from Germany in the final
settlement consequent on the plebiscite.

(2) The arrangement as to the Saar should hold good, except that, on the
one hand, Germany should receive no credit for the mines, and, on the
other, should receive back both the mines and the territory without
payment and unconditionally after ten years. But this should be
conditional on France's entering into an agreement for the same period
to supply Germany from Lorraine with at least 50 per cent of the
iron-ore which was carried from Lorraine into Germany proper before the
war, in return for an undertaking from Germany to supply Lorraine with
an amount of coal equal to the whole amount formerly sent to Lorraine
from Germany proper, after allowing for the output of the Saar.

(3) The arrangement as to Upper Silesia should hold good. That is to
say, a plebiscite should be held, and in coming to a final decision
"regard will be paid (by the principal Allied and Associated Powers) to
the wishes of the inhabitants as shown by the vote, and to the
geographical and economic conditions of the locality." But the Allies
should declare that in their judgment "economic conditions" require the
inclusion of the coal districts in Germany unless the wishes of the
inhabitants are decidedly to the contrary.

(4) The Coal Commission already established by the Allies should become
an appanage of the League of Nations, and should be enlarged to include
representatives of Germany and the other States of Central and Eastern
Europe, of the Northern Neutrals, and of Switzerland. Its authority
should be advisory only, but should extend over the distribution of the
coal supplies of Germany, Poland, and the constituent parts of the
former Austro-Hungarian Empire, and of the exportable surplus of the
United Kingdom. All the States represented on the Commission should
undertake to furnish it with the fullest information, and to be guided
by its advice so far as their sovereignty and their vital interests
permit.

_Tariffs_.--A Free Trade Union should be established under the auspices
of the League of Nations of countries undertaking to impose no
protectionist tariffs[160] whatever against the produce of other members
of the Union, Germany, Poland, the new States which formerly composed
the Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Empires, and the Mandated States should
be compelled to adhere to this Union for ten years, after which time
adherence would be voluntary. The adherence of other States would be
voluntary from the outset. But it is to be hoped that the United
Kingdom, at any rate, would become an original member.

       *       *       *       *       *

By fixing the Reparation payments well within Germany's capacity to pay,
we make possible the renewal of hope and enterprise within her
territory, we avoid the perpetual friction and opportunity of improper
pressure arising out of Treaty clauses which are impossible of
fulfilment, and we render unnecessary the intolerable powers of the
Reparation Commission.

By a moderation of the clauses relating directly or indirectly to coal,
and by the exchange of iron-ore, we permit the continuance of Germany's
industrial life, and put limits on the loss of productivity which would
be brought about otherwise by the interference of political frontiers
with the natural localization of the iron and steel industry.

By the proposed Free Trade Union some part of the loss of organization
and economic efficiency may be retrieved, which must otherwise result
from the innumerable new political frontiers now created between greedy,
jealous, immature, and economically incomplete nationalist States.
Economic frontiers were tolerable so long as an immense territory was
included in a few great Empires; but they will not be tolerable when the
Empires of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey have been
partitioned between some twenty independent authorities. A Free Trade
Union, comprising the whole of Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern
Europe, Siberia, Turkey, and (I should hope) the United Kingdom, Egypt,
and India, might do as much for the peace and prosperity of the world as
the League of Nations itself. Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, and
Switzerland might be expected to adhere to it shortly. And it would be
greatly to be desired by their friends that France and Italy also should
see their way to adhesion.

It would be objected, I suppose, by some critics that such an
arrangement might go some way in effect towards realizing the former
German dream of Mittel-Europa. If other countries were so foolish as to
remain outside the Union and to leave to Germany all its advantages,
there might be some truth in this. But an economic system, to which
every one had the opportunity of belonging and which gave special
privilege to none, is surely absolutely free from the objections of a
privileged and avowedly imperialistic scheme of exclusion and
discrimination. Our attitude to these criticisms must be determined by
our whole moral and emotional reaction to the future of international
relations and the Peace of the World. If we take the view that for at
least a generation to come Germany cannot be trusted with even a modicum
of prosperity, that while all our recent Allies are angels of light, all
our recent enemies, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, and the rest, are
children of the devil, that year by year Germany must be kept
impoverished and her children starved and crippled, and that she must be
ringed round by enemies; then we shall reject all the proposals of this
chapter, and particularly those which may assist Germany to regain a
part of her former material prosperity and find a means of livelihood
for the industrial population of her towns. But if this view of nations
and of their relation to one another is adopted by the democracies of
Western Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us
all. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe,
vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for
very long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the
despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the
late German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever
is victor, the civilization and the progress of our generation. Even
though the result disappoint us, must we not base our actions on better
expectations, and believe that the prosperity and happiness of one
country promotes that of others, that the solidarity of man is not a
fiction, and that nations can still afford to treat other nations as
fellow-creatures?

Such changes as I have proposed above might do something appreciable to
enable the industrial populations of Europe to continue to earn a
livelihood. But they would not be enough by themselves. In particular,
France would be a loser on paper (on paper only, for she will never
secure the actual fulfilment of her present claims), and an escape from
her embarrassments must be shown her in some other direction. I proceed,
therefore, to proposals, first, for the adjustment of the claims of
America and the Allies amongst themselves; and second, for the provision
of sufficient credit to enable Europe to re-create her stock of
circulating capital.


2. _The Settlement of Inter-Ally Indebtedness_

In proposing a modification of the Reparation terms, I have considered
them so far only in relation to Germany. But fairness requires that so
great a reduction in the amount should be accompanied by a readjustment
of its apportionment between the Allies themselves. The professions
which our statesmen made on every platform during the war, as well as
other considerations, surely require that the areas damaged by the
enemy's invasion should receive a priority of compensation. While this
was one of the ultimate objects for which we said we were fighting, we
never included the recovery of separation allowances amongst our war
aims. I suggest, therefore, that we should by our acts prove ourselves
sincere and trustworthy, and that accordingly Great Britain should waive
altogether her claims for cash payment in favor of Belgium, Serbia, and
France. The whole of the payments made by Germany would then be subject
to the prior charge of repairing the material injury done to those
countries and provinces which suffered actual invasion by the enemy; and
I believe that the sum of $7,500,000,000 thus available would be
adequate to cover entirely the actual costs of restoration. Further, it
is only by a complete subordination of her own claims for cash
compensation that Great Britain can ask with clean hands for a revision
of the Treaty and clear her honor from the breach of faith for which she
bears the main responsibility, as a result of the policy to which the
General Election of 1918 pledged her representatives.

With the Reparation problem thus cleared up it would be possible to
bring forward with a better grace and more hope of success two other
financial proposals, each of which involves an appeal to the generosity
of the United States.

The first is for the entire cancellation of Inter-Ally indebtedness
(that is to say, indebtedness between the Governments of the Allied and
Associated countries) incurred for the purposes of the war. This
proposal, which has been put forward already in certain quarters, is one
which I believe to be absolutely essential to the future prosperity of
the world. It would be an act of far-seeing statesmanship for the United
Kingdom and the United States, the two Powers chiefly concerned, to
adopt it. The sums of money which are involved are shown approximately
in the following table:--[161]

Thus the total volume of Inter-Ally indebtedness, assuming that loans
from one Ally are not set off against loans to another, is nearly
$20,000,000,000. The United States is a lender only. The United Kingdom
has lent about twice as much as she has borrowed. France has borrowed
about three times as much as she has lent. The other Allies have been
borrowers only.

If all the above Inter-Ally indebtedness were mutually forgiven, the
net result on paper (_i.e._ assuming all the loans to be good) would be
a surrender by the United States of about $10,000,000,000 and by the
United Kingdom of about $4,500,000,000. France would gain about
$3,500,000,000 and Italy about $4,000,000,000. But these figures
overstate the loss to the United Kingdom and understate the gain to
France; for a large part of the loans made by both these countries has
been to Russia and cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be considered
good. If the loans which the United Kingdom has made to her Allies are
reckoned to be worth 50 per cent of their full value (an arbitrary but
convenient assumption which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has adopted
on more than one occasion as being as good as any other for the purposes
of an approximate national balance sheet), the operation would involve
her neither in loss nor in gain. But in whatever way the net result is
calculated on paper, the relief in anxiety which such a liquidation of
the position would carry with it would be very great. It is from the
United States, therefore, that the proposal asks generosity.

Speaking with a very intimate knowledge of the relations throughout the
war between the British, the American, and the other Allied Treasuries,
I believe this to be an act of generosity for which Europe can fairly
ask, provided Europe is making an honorable attempt in other
directions, not to continue war, economic or otherwise, but to achieve
the economic reconstitution of the whole Continent, The financial
sacrifices of the United States have been, in proportion to her wealth,
immensely less than those of the European States. This could hardly have
been otherwise. It was a European quarrel, in which the United States
Government could not have justified itself before its citizens in
expending the whole national strength, as did the Europeans. After the
United States came into the war her financial assistance was lavish and
unstinted, and without this assistance the Allies could never have won
the war,[165] quite apart from the decisive influence of the arrival of
the American troops. Europe, too, should never forget the extraordinary
assistance afforded her during the first six months of 1919 through the
agency of Mr. Hoover and the American Commission of Relief. Never was a
nobler work of disinterested goodwill carried through with more tenacity
and sincerity and skill, and with less thanks either asked or given.
The ungrateful Governments of Europe owe much more to the statesmanship
and insight of Mr. Hoover and his band of American workers than they
have yet appreciated or will ever acknowledge. The American Relief
Commission, and they only, saw the European position during those months
in its true perspective and felt towards it as men should. It was their
efforts, their energy, and the American resources placed by the
President at their disposal, often acting in the teeth of European
obstruction, which not only saved an immense amount of human suffering,
but averted a widespread breakdown of the European system.[166]

But in speaking thus as we do of American financial assistance, we
tacitly assume, and America, I believe, assumed it too when she gave the
money, that it was not in the nature of an investment. If Europe is
going to repay the $10,000,000,000 worth of financial assistance which
she has had from the United States with compound interest at 5 per cent,
the matter takes on quite a different complexion. If America's advances
are to be regarded in this light, her relative financial sacrifice has
been very slight indeed.

Controversies as to relative sacrifice are very barren and very foolish
also; for there is no reason in the world why relative sacrifice should
necessarily be equal,--so many other very relevant considerations being
quite different in the two cases. The two or three facts following are
put forward, therefore, not to suggest that they provide any compelling
argument for Americans, but only to show that from his own selfish point
of view an Englishman is not seeking to avoid due sacrifice on his
country's part in making the present suggestion. (1) The sums which the
British Treasury borrowed from the American Treasury, after the latter
came into the war, were approximately offset by the sums which England
lent to her other Allies _during the same period_ (i.e. excluding sums
lent before the United States came into the war); so that almost the
whole of England's indebtedness to the United States was incurred, not
on her own account, but to enable her to assist the rest of her Allies,
who were for various reasons not in a position to draw their assistance
from the United States direct.[167] (2) The United Kingdom has disposed
of about $5,000,000,000 worth of her foreign securities, and in addition
has incurred foreign debt to the amount of about $6,000,000,000. The
United States, so far from selling, has bought back upwards of
$5,000,000,000, and has incurred practically no foreign debt. (3) The
population of the United Kingdom is about one-half that of the United
States, the income about one-third, and the accumulated wealth between
one-half and one-third. The financial capacity of the United Kingdom may
therefore be put at about two-fifths that of the United States. This
figure enables us to make the following comparison:--Excluding loans to
Allies in each case (as is right on the assumption that these loans are
to be repaid), the war expenditure of the United Kingdom has been about
three times that of the United Sates, or in proportion to capacity
between seven and eight times.

Having cleared this issue out of the way as briefly as possible, I turn
to the broader issues of the future relations between the parties to the
late war, by which the present proposal must primarily be judged.

Failing such a settlement as is now proposed, the war will have ended
with a network of heavy tribute payable from one Ally to another. The
total amount of this tribute is even likely to exceed the amount
obtainable from the enemy; and the war will have ended with the
intolerable result of the Allies paying indemnities to one another
instead of receiving them from the enemy.

For this reason the question of Inter-Allied indebtedness is closely
bound up with the intense popular feeling amongst the European Allies on
the question of indemnities,--a feeling which is based, not on any
reasonable calculation of what Germany can, in fact, pay, but on a
well-founded appreciation of the unbearable financial situation in which
these countries will find themselves unless she pays. Take Italy as an
extreme example. If Italy can reasonably be expected to pay
$4,000,000,000, surely Germany can and ought to pay an immeasurably
higher figure. Or if it is decided (as it must be) that Austria can pay
next to nothing, is it not an intolerable conclusion that Italy should
be loaded with a crushing tribute, while Austria escapes? Or, to put it
slightly differently, how can Italy be expected to submit to payment of
this great sum and see Czecho-Slovakia pay little or nothing? At the
other end of the scale there is the United Kingdom. Here the financial
position is different, since to ask us to pay $4,000,000,000 is a very
different proposition from asking Italy to pay it. But the sentiment is
much the same. If we have to be satisfied without full compensation from
Germany, how bitter will be the protests against paying it to the
United States. We, it will be said, have to be content with a claim
against the bankrupt estates of Germany, France, Italy, and Russia,
whereas the United States has secured a first mortgage upon us. The case
of France is at least as overwhelming. She can barely secure from
Germany the full measure of the destruction of her countryside. Yet
victorious France must pay her friends and Allies more than four times
the indemnity which in the defeat of 1870 she paid Germany. The hand of
Bismarck was light compared with that of an Ally or of an Associate. A
settlement of Inter-Ally indebtedness is, therefore, an indispensable
preliminary to the peoples of the Allied countries facing, with other
than a maddened and exasperated heart, the inevitable truth about the
prospects of an indemnity from the enemy.

It might be an exaggeration to say that it is impossible for the
European Allies to pay the capital and interest due from them on these
debts, but to make them do so would certainly be to impose a crushing
burden. They may be expected, therefore, to make constant attempts to
evade or escape payment, and these attempts will be a constant source of
international friction and ill-will for many years to come. A debtor
nation does not love its creditor, and it is fruitless to expect
feelings of goodwill from France, Italy, and Russia towards this
country or towards America, if their future development is stifled for
many years to come by the annual tribute which they must pay us. There
will be a great incentive to them to seek their friends in other
directions, and any future rupture of peaceable relations will always
carry with it the enormous advantage of escaping the payment of external
debts, if, on the other hand, these great debts are forgiven, a stimulus
will be given to the solidarity and true friendliness of the nations
lately associated.

The existence of the great war debts is a menace to financial stability
everywhere. There is no European country in which repudiation may not
soon become an important political issue. In the case of internal debt,
however, there are interested parties on both sides, and the question is
one of the internal distribution of wealth. With external debts this is
not so, and the creditor nations may soon find their interest
inconveniently bound up with the maintenance of a particular type of
government or economic organization in the debtor countries. Entangling
alliances or entangling leagues are nothing to the entanglements of cash
owing.

The final consideration influencing the reader's attitude to this
proposal must, however, depend on his view as to the future place in the
world's progress of the vast paper entanglements which are our legacy
from war finance both at home and abroad. The war has ended with every
one owing every one else immense sums of money. Germany owes a large sum
to the Allies, the Allies owe a large sum to Great Britain, and Great
Britain owes a large sum to the United States. The holders of war loan
in every country are owed a large sum by the State, and the State in its
turn is owed a large sum by these and other taxpayers. The whole
position is in the highest degree artificial, misleading, and vexatious.
We shall never be able to move again, unless we can free our limbs from
these paper shackles. A general bonfire is so great a necessity that
unless we can make of it an orderly and good-tempered affair in which no
serious injustice is done to any one, it will, when it comes at last,
grow into a conflagration that may destroy much else as well. As regards
internal debt, I am one of those who believe that a capital levy for the
extinction of debt is an absolute prerequisite of sound finance in
everyone of the European belligerent countries. But the continuance on a
huge scale of indebtedness between Governments has special dangers of
its own.

Before the middle of the nineteenth century no nation owed payments to a
foreign nation on any considerable scale, except such tributes as were
exacted under the compulsion of actual occupation in force and, at one
time, by absentee princes under the sanctions of feudalism. It is true
that the need for European capitalism to find an outlet in the New World
has led during the past fifty years, though even now on a relatively
modest scale, to such countries as Argentine owing an annual sum to such
countries as England. But the system is fragile; and it has only
survived because its burden on the paying countries has not so far been
oppressive, because this burden is represented by real assets and is
bound up with the property system generally, and because the sums
already lent are not unduly large in relation to those which it is still
hoped to borrow. Bankers are used to this system, and believe it to be a
necessary part of the permanent order of society. They are disposed to
believe, therefore, by analogy with it, that a comparable system between
Governments, on a far vaster and definitely oppressive scale,
represented by no real assets, and less closely associated with the
property system, is natural and reasonable and in conformity with human
nature.

I doubt this view of the world. Even capitalism at home, which engages
many local sympathies, which plays a real part in the daily process of
production, and upon the security of which the present organization of
society largely depends, is not very safe. But however this may be, will
the discontented peoples of Europe be willing for a generation to come
so to order their lives that an appreciable part of their daily produce
may be available to meet a foreign payment, the reason of which, whether
as between Europe and America, or as between Germany and the rest of
Europe, does not spring compellingly from their sense of justice or
duty?

On the one hand, Europe must depend in the long run on her own daily
labor and not on the largesse of America; but, on the other hand, she
will not pinch herself in order that the fruit of her daily labor may go
elsewhere. In short, I do not believe that any of these tributes will
continue to be paid, at the best, for more than a very few years. They
do not square with human nature or agree with the spirit of the age.

If there is any force in this mode of thought, expediency and generosity
agree together, and the policy which will best promote immediate
friendship between nations will not conflict with the permanent
interests of the benefactor.[168]


3. _An International Loan_

I pass to a second financial proposal. The requirements of Europe are
_immediate_. The prospect of being relieved of oppressive interest
payments to England and America over the whole life of the next two
generations (and of receiving from Germany some assistance year by year
to the costs of restoration) would free the future from excessive
anxiety. But it would not meet the ills of the immediate present,--the
excess of Europe's imports over her exports, the adverse exchange, and
the disorder of the currency. It will be very difficult for European
production to get started again without a temporary measure of external
assistance. I am therefore a supporter of an international loan in some
shape or form, such as has been advocated in many quarters in France,
Germany, and England, and also in the United States. In whatever way the
ultimate responsibility for repayment is distributed, the burden of
finding the immediate resources must inevitably fall in major part upon
the United States.

The chief objections to all the varieties of this species of project
are, I suppose, the following. The United States is disinclined to
entangle herself further (after recent experiences) in the affairs of
Europe, and, anyhow, has for the time being no more capital to spare for
export on a large scale. There is no guarantee that Europe will put
financial assistance to proper use, or that she will not squander it and
be in just as bad case two or three years hence as she is in now;--M.
Klotz will use the money to put off the day of taxation a little longer,
Italy and Jugo-Slavia will fight one another on the proceeds, Poland
will devote it to fulfilling towards all her neighbors the military rÙle
which France has designed for her, the governing classes of Roumania
will divide up the booty amongst themselves. In short, America would
have postponed her own capital developments and raised her own cost of
living in order that Europe might continue for another year or two the
practices, the policy, and the men of the past nine months. And as for
assistance to Germany, is it reasonable or at all tolerable that the
European Allies, having stripped Germany of her last vestige of working
capital, in opposition to the arguments and appeals of the American
financial representatives at Paris, should then turn to the United
States for funds to rehabilitate the victim in sufficient measure to
allow the spoliation to recommence in a year or two?

There is no answer to these objections as matters are now. If I had
influence at the United States Treasury, I would not lend a penny to a
single one of the present Governments of Europe. They are not to be
trusted with resources which they would devote to the furtherance of
policies in repugnance to which, in spite of the President's failure to
assert either the might or the ideals of the people of the United
States, the Republican and the Democratic parties are probably united.
But if, as we must pray they will, the souls of the European peoples
turn away this winter from the false idols which have survived the war
that created them, and substitute in their hearts for the hatred and the
nationalism, which now possess them, thoughts and hopes of the happiness
and solidarity of the European family,--then should natural piety and
filial love impel the American people to put on one side all the smaller
objections of private advantage and to complete the work, that they
began in saving Europe from the tyranny of organized force, by saving
her from herself. And even if the conversion is not fully accomplished,
and some parties only in each of the European countries have espoused a
policy of reconciliation, America can still point the way and hold up
the hands of the party of peace by having a plan and a condition on
which she will give her aid to the work of renewing life.

The impulse which, we are told, is now strong in the mind of the United
States to be quit of the turmoil, the complication, the violence, the
expense, and, above all, the unintelligibility of the European problems,
is easily understood. No one can feel more intensely than the writer
how natural it is to retort to the folly and impracticability of the
European statesmen,--Rot, then, in your own malice, and we will go our
way--


    Remote from Europe; from her blasted hopes;
    Her fields of carnage, and polluted air.

But if America recalls for a moment what Europe has meant to her and
still means to her, what Europe, the mother of art and of knowledge, in
spite of everything, still is and still will be, will she not reject
these counsels of indifference and isolation, and interest herself in
what may prove decisive issues for the progress and civilization of all
mankind?

Assuming then, if only to keep our hopes up, that America will be
prepared to contribute to the process of building up the good forces of
Europe, and will not, having completed the destruction of an enemy,
leave us to our misfortunes,--what form should her aid take?

I do not propose to enter on details. But the main outlines of all
schemes for an international loan are much the same, The countries in a
position to lend assistance, the neutrals, the United Kingdom, and, for
the greater portion of the sum required, the United States, must provide
foreign purchasing credits for all the belligerent countries of
continental Europe, allied and ex-enemy alike. The aggregate sum
required might not be so large as is sometimes supposed. Much might be
done, perhaps, with a fund of $1,000,000,000 in the first instance. This
sum, even if a precedent of a different kind had been established by the
cancellation of Inter-Ally War Debt, should be lent and should be
borrowed with the unequivocal intention of its being repaid in full.
With this object in view, the security for the loan should be the best
obtainable, and the arrangements for its ultimate repayment as complete
as possible. In particular, it should rank, both for payment of interest
and discharge of capital, in front of all Reparation claims, all
Inter-Ally War Debt, all internal war loans, and all other Government
indebtedness of any other kind. Those borrowing countries who will be
entitled to Reparation payments should be required to pledge all such
receipts to repayment of the new loan. And all the borrowing countries
should be required to place their customs duties on a gold basis and to
pledge such receipts to its service.

Expenditure out of the loan should be subject to general, but not
detailed, supervision by the lending countries.

If, in addition to this loan for the purchase of food and materials, a
guarantee fund were established up to an equal amount, namely
$1,000,000,000 (of which it would probably prove necessary to find only
a part in cash), to which all members of the League of Nations would
contribute according to their means, it might be practicable to base
upon it a general reorganization of the currency.

In this manner Europe might be equipped with the minimum amount of
liquid resources necessary to revive her hopes, to renew her economic
organization, and to enable her great intrinsic wealth to function for
the benefit of her workers. It is useless at the present time to
elaborate such schemes in further detail. A great change is necessary in
public opinion before the proposals of this chapter can enter the region
of practical politics, and we must await the progress of events as
patiently as we can.


4. _The Relations of Central Europe to Russia_

I have said very little of Russia in this book. The broad character of
the situation there needs no emphasis, and of the details we know almost
nothing authentic. But in a discussion as to how the economic situation
of Europe can be restored there are one or two aspects of the Russian
question which are vitally important.

From the military point of view an ultimate union of forces between
Russia and Germany is greatly feared in some quarters. This would be
much more likely to take place in the event of reactionary movements
being successful in each of the two countries, whereas an effective
unity of purpose between Lenin and the present essentially middle-class
Government of Germany is unthinkable. On the other hand, the same people
who fear such a union are even more afraid of the success of Bolshevism;
and yet they have to recognize that the only efficient forces for
fighting it are, inside Russia, the reactionaries, and, outside Russia,
the established forces of order and authority in Germany. Thus the
advocates of intervention in Russia, whether direct or indirect, are at
perpetual cross-purposes with themselves. They do not know what they
want; or, rather, they want what they cannot help seeing to be
incompatibles. This is one of the reasons why their policy is so
inconstant and so exceedingly futile.

The same conflict of purpose is apparent in the attitude of the Council
of the Allies at Paris towards the present Government of Germany. A
victory of Spartacism in Germany might well be the prelude to Revolution
everywhere: it would renew the forces of Bolshevism in Russia, and
precipitate the dreaded union of Germany and Russia; it would certainly
put an end to any expectations which have been built on the financial
and economic clauses of the Treaty of Peace. Therefore Paris does not
love Spartacus. But, on the other hand, a victory of reaction in Germany
would be regarded by every one as a threat to the security of Europe,
and as endangering the fruits of victory and the basis of the Peace.
Besides, a new military power establishing itself in the East, with its
spiritual home in Brandenburg, drawing to itself all the military talent
and all the military adventurers, all those who regret emperors and hate
democracy, in the whole of Eastern and Central and South-Eastern Europe,
a power which would be geographically inaccessible to the military
forces of the Allies, might well found, at least in the anticipations of
the timid, a new Napoleonic domination, rising, as a phoenix, from the
ashes of cosmopolitan militarism. So Paris dare not love Brandenburg.
The argument points, then, to the sustentation of those moderate forces
of order, which, somewhat to the world's surprise, still manage to
maintain themselves on the rock of the German character. But the present
Government of Germany stands for German unity more perhaps than for
anything else; the signature of the Peace was, above all, the price
which some Germans thought it worth while to pay for the unity which was
all that was left them of 1870. Therefore Paris, with some hopes of
disintegration across the Rhine not yet extinguished, can resist no
opportunity of insult or indignity, no occasion of lowering the
prestige or weakening the influence of a Government, with the continued
stability of which all the conservative interests of Europe are
nevertheless bound up.

The same dilemma affects the future of Poland in the rÙle which France
has cast for her. She is to be strong, Catholic, militarist, and
faithful, the consort, or at least the favorite, of victorious France,
prosperous and magnificent between the ashes of Russia and the ruin of
Germany. Roumania, if only she could be persuaded to keep up appearances
a little more, is a part of the same scatter-brained conception. Yet,
unless her great neighbors are prosperous and orderly, Poland is an
economic impossibility with no industry but Jew-baiting. And when Poland
finds that the seductive policy of France is pure rhodomontade and that
there is no money in it whatever, nor glory either, she will fall, as
promptly as possible, into the arms of somebody else.

The calculations of "diplomacy" lead us, therefore, nowhere. Crazy
dreams and childish intrigue in Russia and Poland and thereabouts are
the favorite indulgence at present of those Englishmen and Frenchmen who
seek excitement in its least innocent form, and believe, or at least
behave as if foreign policy was of the same _genre_ as a cheap
melodrama.

Let us turn, therefore, to something more solid. The German Government
has announced (October 30, 1919) its continued adhesion to a policy of
non-intervention in the internal affairs of Russia, "not only on
principle, but because it believes that this policy is also justified
from a practical point of view." Let us assume that at last we also
adopt the same standpoint, if not on principle, at least from a
practical point of view. What are then the fundamental economic factors
in the future relations of Central to Eastern Europe?

Before the war Western and Central Europe drew from Russia a substantial
part of their imported cereals. Without Russia the importing countries
would have had to go short. Since 1914 the loss of the Russian supplies
has been made good, partly by drawing on reserves, partly from the
bumper harvests of North America called forth by Mr. Hoover's guaranteed
price, but largely by economies of consumption and by privation. After
1920 the need of Russian supplies will be even greater than it was
before the war; for the guaranteed price in North America will have been
discontinued, the normal increase of population there will, as compared
with 1914, have swollen the home demand appreciably, and the soil of
Europe will not yet have recovered its former productivity. If trade is
not resumed with Russia, wheat in 1920-21 (unless the seasons are
specially bountiful) must be scarce and very dear. The blockade of
Russia, lately proclaimed by the Allies, is therefore a foolish and
short-sighted proceeding; we are blockading not so much Russia as
ourselves.

The process of reviving the Russian export trade is bound in any case to
be a slow one. The present productivity of the Russian peasant is not
believed to be sufficient to yield an exportable surplus on the pre-war
scale. The reasons for this are obviously many, but amongst them are
included the insufficiency of agricultural implements and accessories
and the absence of incentive to production caused by the lack of
commodities in the towns which the peasants can purchase in exchange for
their produce. Finally, there is the decay of the transport system,
which hinders or renders impossible the collection of local surpluses in
the big centers of distribution.

I see no possible means of repairing this loss of productivity within
any reasonable period of time except through the agency of German
enterprise and organization. It is impossible geographically and for
many other reasons for Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Americans to undertake
it;--we have neither the incentive nor the means for doing the work on a
sufficient scale. Germany, on the other hand, has the experience, the
incentive, and to a large extent the materials for furnishing the
Russian peasant with the goods of which he has been starved for the
past five years, for reorganizing the business of transport and
collection, and so for bringing into the world's pool, for the common
advantage, the supplies from which we are now so disastrously cut off.
It is in our interest to hasten the day when German agents and
organizers will be in a position to set in train in every Russian
village the impulses of ordinary economic motive. This is a process
quite independent of the governing authority in Russia; but we may
surely predict with some certainty that, whether or not the form of
communism represented by Soviet government proves permanently suited to
the Russian temperament, the revival of trade, of the comforts of life
and of ordinary economic motive are not likely to promote the extreme
forms of those doctrines of violence and tyranny which are the children
of war and of despair.

Let us then in our Russian policy not only applaud and imitate the
policy of non-intervention which the Government of Germany has
announced, but, desisting from a blockade which is injurious to our own
permanent interests, as well as illegal, let us encourage and assist
Germany to take up again her place in Europe as a creator and organizer
of wealth for her Eastern and Southern neighbors.

There are many persons in whom such proposals will raise strong
prejudices. I ask them to follow out in thought the result of yielding
to these prejudices. If we oppose in detail every means by which Germany
or Russia can recover their material well-being, because we feel a
national, racial, or political hatred for their populations or their
Governments, we must be prepared to face the consequences of such
feelings. Even if there is no moral solidarity between the
nearly-related races of Europe, there is an economic solidarity which we
cannot disregard. Even now, the world markets are one. If we do not
allow Germany to exchange products with Russia and so feed herself, she
must inevitably compete with us for the produce of the New World. The
more successful we are in snapping economic relations between Germany
and Russia, the more we shall depress the level of our own economic
standards and increase the gravity of our own domestic problems. This is
to put the issue on its lowest grounds. There are other arguments, which
the most obtuse cannot ignore, against a policy of spreading and
encouraging further the economic ruin of great countries.

       *       *       *       *       *

I see few signs of sudden or dramatic developments anywhere. Riots and
revolutions there may be, but not such, at present, as to have
fundamental significance. Against political tyranny and injustice
Revolution is a weapon. But what counsels of hope can Revolution offer
to sufferers from economic privation, which does not arise out of the
injustices of distribution but is general? The only safeguard against
Revolution in Central Europe is indeed the fact that, even to the minds
of men who are desperate, Revolution offers no prospect of improvement
whatever. There may, therefore, be ahead of us a long, silent process of
semi-starvation, and of a gradual, steady lowering of the standards of
life and comfort. The bankruptcy and decay of Europe, if we allow it to
proceed, will affect every one in the long-run, but perhaps not in a way
that is striking or immediate.

This has one fortunate side. We may still have time to reconsider our
courses and to view the world with new eyes. For the immediate future
events are taking charge, and the near destiny of Europe is no longer in
the hands of any man. The events of the coming year will not be shaped
by the deliberate acts of statesmen, but by the hidden currents, flowing
continually beneath the surface of political history, of which no one
can predict the outcome. In one way only can we influence these hidden
currents,--by setting in motion those forces of instruction and
imagination which change _opinion_. The assertion of truth, the
unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of hate, the enlargement and
instruction of men's hearts and minds, must be the means.

In this autumn of 1919, in which I write, we are at the dead season of
our fortunes. The reaction from the exertions, the fears, and the
sufferings of the past five years is at its height. Our power of feeling
or caring beyond the immediate questions of our own material well-being
is temporarily eclipsed. The greatest events outside our own direct
experience and the most dreadful anticipations cannot move us.

                In each human heart terror survives
    The ruin it has gorged: the loftiest fear
    All that they would disdain to think were true:
    Hypocrisy and custom make their minds
    The fanes of many a worship, now outworn.
    They dare not devise good for man's estate,
    And yet they know not that they do not dare.
    The good want power but to weep barren tears.
    The powerful goodness want: worse need for them.
    The wise want love; and those who love want wisdom;
    And all best things are thus confused to ill.
    Many are strong and rich, and would be just,
    But live among their suffering fellow-men
    As if none felt: they know not what they do.

We have been moved already beyond endurance, and need rest. Never in the
lifetime of men now living has the universal element in the soul of man
burnt so dimly.

For these reasons the true voice of the new generation has not yet
spoken, and silent opinion is not yet formed. To the formation of the
general opinion of the future I dedicate this book.

FOOTNOTES:

[157] The figures for the United Kingdom are as follows:

                         Net                  Excess of
       Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports
       Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000

               1913     274,650     218,850      55,800
               1914     250,485     179,465      71,020
    Jan.-Mar.  1919     547,890     245,610     302,280
    April-June 1919     557,015     312,315     244,700
    July-Sept. 1919     679,635     344,315     335,320

But this excess is by no means so serious as it looks; for with the
present high freight earnings of the mercantile marine the various
"invisible" exports of the United Kingdom are probably even higher than
they were before the war, and may average at least $225,000,000 monthly.

[158] President Wilson was mistaken in suggesting that the
supervision of Reparation payments has been entrusted to the League of
Nations. As I pointed out in Chapter V., whereas the League is invoked
in regard to most of the continuing economic and territorial provisions
of the Treaty, this is not the case as regards Reparation, over the
problems and modifications of which the Reparation Commission is supreme
without appeal of any kind to the League of Nations.

[159] These Articles, which provide safeguards against the
outbreak of war between members of the League and also between members
and non-members, are the solid achievement of the Covenant. These
Articles make substantially less probable a war between organized Great
Powers such as that of 1914. This alone should commend the League to all
men.

[160] It would be expedient so to define a "protectionist
tariff" as to permit (_a_) the total prohibition of certain imports;
(_b_) the imposition of sumptuary or revenue customs duties on
commodities not produced at home; (_c_) the imposition of customs duties
which did not exceed by more than five per cent a countervailing excise
on similar commodities produced at home; (_d_) export duties. Further,
special exceptions might be permitted by a majority vote of the
countries entering the Union. Duties which had existed for five years
prior to a country's entering the Union might be allowed to disappear
gradually by equal instalments spread over the five years subsequent to
joining the Union.

[161] The figures in this table are partly estimated, and are
probably not completely accurate in detail; but they show the
approximate figures with sufficient accuracy for the purposes of the
present argument. The British figures are taken from the White Paper of
October 23, 1919 (Cmd. 377). In any actual settlement, adjustments would
be required in connection with certain loans of gold and also in other
respects, and I am concerned in what follows with the broad principle
only. The total excludes loans raised by the United Kingdom on the
market in the United States, and loans raised by France on the market in
the United Kingdom or the United States, or from the Bank of England.

[162] This allows nothing for interest on the debt since the
Bolshevik Revolution.

[163] No interest has been charged on the advances made to
these countries.

[164] The actual total of loans by the United States up to date
is very nearly $10,000,000,000, but I have not got the latest details.

[165] The financial history of the six months from the end of
the summer of 1916 up to the entry of the United States into the war in
April, 1917, remains to be written. Very few persons, outside the
half-dozen officials of the British Treasury who lived in daily contact
with the immense anxieties and impossible financial requirements of
those days, can fully realize what steadfastness and courage were
needed, and how entirely hopeless the task would soon have become
without the assistance of the United States Treasury. The financial
problems from April, 1917, onwards were of an entirely different order
from those of the preceding months.

[166] Mr. Hoover was the only man who emerged from the ordeal
of Paris with an enhanced reputation. This complex personality, with his
habitual air of weary Titan (or, as others might put it, of exhausted
prize-fighter), his eyes steadily fixed on the true and essential facts
of the European situation, imported into the Councils of Paris, when he
took part in them, precisely that atmosphere of reality, knowledge,
magnanimity, and disinterestedness which, if they had been found in
other quarters also, would have given us the Good Peace.

[167] Even after the United States came into the war the bulk
of Russian expenditure in the United States, as well as the whole of
that Government's other foreign expenditure, had to be paid for by the
British Treasury.

[168] It is reported that the United States Treasury has agreed
to fund (_i.e._ to add to the principal sum) the interest owing them on
their loans to the Allied Governments during the next three years. I
presume that the British Treasury is likely to follow suit. If the debts
are to be paid ultimately, this piling up of the obligations at compound
interest makes the position progressively worse. But the arrangement
wisely offered by the United States Treasury provides a due interval for
the calm consideration of the whole problem in the light of the
after-war position as it will soon disclose itself.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE


We leave Saving to the private investor, and we encourage him to place
his savings mainly in titles to money. We leave the responsibility
for setting Production in motion to the business man, who is mainly
influenced by the profits which he expects to accrue to himself in
terms of money. Those who are not in favour of drastic changes in the
existing organisation of society believe that these arrangements,
being in accord with human nature, have great advantages. But they
cannot work properly if the money, which they assume as a stable
measuring-rod, is undependable. Unemployment, the precarious life of
the worker, the disappointment of expectation, the sudden loss of
savings, the excessive windfalls to individuals, the speculator, the
profiteer--all proceed, in large measure, from the instability of the
standard of value.

It is often supposed that the costs of production are threefold,
corresponding to the rewards of labour, enterprise, and accumulation.
But there is a fourth cost, namely risk; and the reward of risk-bearing
is one of the heaviest, and perhaps the most avoidable, burden
on production. This element of risk is greatly aggravated by the
instability of the standard of value. Currency Reforms, which led to
the adoption by this country and the world at large of sound monetary
principles, would diminish the wastes of _Risk_, which consume at
present too much of our estate.

Nowhere do conservative notions consider themselves more in place than
in currency; yet nowhere is the need of innovation more urgent. One
is often warned that a scientific treatment of currency questions is
impossible because the banking world is intellectually incapable of
understanding its own problems. If this is true, the order of Society,
which they stand for, will decay. But I do not believe it. What we have
lacked is a clear analysis of the real facts, rather than ability to
understand an analysis already given. If the new ideas, now developing
in many quarters, are sound and right, I do not doubt that sooner or
later they will prevail. I dedicate this book, humbly and without
permission, to the Governors and Court of the Bank of England, who
now and for the future have a much more difficult and anxious task
entrusted to them than in former days.

CHAPTER I

THE CONSEQUENCES TO SOCIETY OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF MONEY


Money is only important for what it will procure. Thus a change in
the monetary unit, which is uniform in its operation and affects all
transactions equally, has no consequences. If, by a change in the
established standard of value, a man received and owned twice as much
money as he did before in payment for all rights and for all efforts,
and if he also paid out twice as much money for all acquisitions and
for all satisfactions, he would be wholly unaffected.

It follows, therefore, that a change in the value of money, that is to
say in the level of prices, is important to Society only in so far as
its incidence is unequal. Such changes have produced in the past, and
are producing now, the vastest social consequences, because, as we all
know, when the value of money changes, it does _not_ change equally for
all persons or for all purposes. A man’s receipts and his outgoings are
not all modified in one uniform proportion. Thus a change in prices and
rewards, as measured in money, generally affects different classes
unequally, transfers wealth from one to another, bestows affluence here
and embarrassment there, and redistributes Fortune’s favours so as to
frustrate design and disappoint expectation.

The fluctuations in the value of money since 1914 have been on a scale
so great as to constitute, with all that they involve, one of the most
significant events in the economic history of the modern world. The
fluctuation of the standard, whether gold, silver, or paper, has not
only been of unprecedented violence, but has been visited on a society
of which the economic organisation is more dependent than that of any
earlier epoch on the assumption that the standard of value would be
moderately stable.

During the Napoleonic Wars and the period immediately succeeding them
the extreme fluctuation of English prices within a single year was 22
per cent; and the highest price level reached during the first quarter
of the nineteenth century, which we used to reckon the most disturbed
period of our currency history, was less than double the lowest and
with an interval of thirteen years. Compare with this the extraordinary
movements of the past nine years. To recall the reader’s mind to the
exact facts, I refer him to the table on the next page.

I have not included those countries--Russia, Poland, and Austria--where
the old currency has long been bankrupt. But it will be observed
that, even apart from the countries which have suffered revolution
or defeat, no quarter of the world has escaped a violent movement. In
the United States, where the gold standard has functioned unabated, in
Japan, where the war brought with it more profit than liability, in the
neutral country of Sweden, the changes in the value of money have been
comparable with those in the United Kingdom.

From 1914 to 1920 all these countries experienced an expansion in
the supply of money to spend relatively to the supply of things to
purchase, that is to say _Inflation_. Since 1920 those countries which
have regained control of their financial situation, not content with
bringing the Inflation to an end, have contracted their supply of money
and have experienced the fruits of _Deflation_. Others have followed
inflationary courses more riotously than before. In a few, of which
Italy is one, an imprudent desire to deflate has been balanced by the
intractability of the financial situation, with the happy result of
comparatively stable prices.

Each process, Inflation and Deflation alike, has inflicted great
injuries. Each has an effect in altering the _distribution_ of wealth
between different classes, Inflation in this respect being the worse of
the two. Each has also an effect in overstimulating or retarding the
_production_ of wealth, though here Deflation is the more injurious.
The division of our subject thus indicated is the most convenient for
us to follow,--examining first the effect of changes in the value of
money on the distribution of wealth with most of our attention on
Inflation, and next their effect on the production of wealth with most
of our attention on Deflation. How have the price changes of the past
nine years affected the productivity of the community as a whole, and
how have they affected the conflicting interests and mutual relations
of its component classes? The answer to these questions will serve to
establish the gravity of the evils, into the remedy for which it is the
object of this book to inquire.


I.--CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF MONEY, AS AFFECTING DISTRIBUTION

For the purpose of this inquiry a triple classification of Society
is convenient--into the Investing Class, the Business Class, and the
Earning Class. These classes overlap, and the same individual may earn,
deal, and invest; but in the present organisation of society such a
division corresponds to a social cleavage and an actual divergence of
interest.


1. _The Investing Class._

Of the various purposes which money serves, some essentially depend
upon the assumption that its real value is nearly constant over
a period of time. The chief of these are those connected, in a
wide sense, with contracts for the _investment of money_. Such
contracts--namely, those which provide for the payment of fixed sums
of money over a long period of time--are the characteristic of what it
is convenient to call the _Investment System_, as distinct from the
property system generally.

Under this phase of capitalism, as developed during the nineteenth
century, many arrangements were devised for separating the management
of property from its ownership. These arrangements were of three
leading types: (1) Those in which the proprietor, while parting with
the management of his property, retained his ownership of it--_i.e._
of the actual land, buildings, and machinery, or of whatever else
it consisted in, this mode of tenure being typified by a holding
of ordinary shares in a joint-stock company; (2) those in which he
parted with the property temporarily, receiving a fixed sum of _money_
annually in the meantime, but regained his property eventually, as
typified by a lease; and (3) those in which he parted with his real
property permanently, in return either for a perpetual annuity fixed in
terms of money, or for a terminable annuity and the repayment of the
principal in money at the end of the term, as typified by mortgages,
bonds, debentures, and preference shares. This third type represents
the full development of _Investment_.

Contracts to receive fixed sums of money at future dates (made without
provision for possible changes in the real value of money at those
dates) must have existed as long as money has been lent and borrowed.
In the form of leases and mortgages, and also of permanent loans
to Governments and to a few private bodies, such as the East India
Company, they were already frequent in the eighteenth century. But
during the nineteenth century they developed a new and increased
importance, and had, by the beginning of the twentieth, divided
the propertied classes into two groups--the “business men” and the
“investors”--with partly divergent interests. The division was not
sharp as between individuals; for business men might be investors
also, and investors might hold ordinary shares; but the division was
nevertheless real, and not the less important because it was seldom
noticed.

By this system the active business class could call to the aid of their
enterprises not only their own wealth but the savings of the whole
community; and the professional and propertied classes, on the other
hand, could find an employment for their resources, which involved them
in little trouble, no responsibility, and (it was believed) small risk.

For a hundred years the system worked, throughout Europe, with an
extraordinary success and facilitated the growth of wealth on an
unprecedented scale. To save and to invest became at once the duty and
the delight of a large class. The savings were seldom drawn on, and,
accumulating at compound interest, made possible the material triumphs
which we now all take for granted. The morals, the politics, the
literature, and the religion of the age joined in a grand conspiracy
for the promotion of saving. God and Mammon were reconciled. Peace on
earth to men of good means. A rich man could, after all, enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven--if only he saved. A new harmony sounded from
the celestial spheres. “It is curious to observe how, through the wise
and beneficent arrangement of Providence, men thus do the greatest
service to the public, when they are thinking of nothing but their own
gain”[1]; so sang the angels.

        [1] _Easy Lessons on Money Matters for the Use of Young
            People._ Published by the Society for Promoting Christian
            Knowledge. Twelfth Edition, 1850.

The atmosphere thus created well harmonised the demands of expanding
business and the needs of an expanding population with the growth of
a comfortable non-business class. But amidst the general enjoyment of
ease and progress, the extent, to which the system depended on the
stability of the money to which the investing classes had committed
their fortunes, was generally overlooked; and an unquestioning
confidence was apparently felt that this matter would look after
itself. Investments spread and multiplied, until, for the middle
classes of the world, the gilt-edged bond came to typify all that was
most permanent and most secure. So rooted in our day has been the
conventional belief in the stability and safety of a money contract
that, according to English law, trustees have been encouraged to embark
their trust funds exclusively in such transactions, and are indeed
forbidden, except in the case of real estate (an exception which is
itself a survival of the conditions of an earlier age), to employ them
otherwise.[2]

        [2] German trustees were not released from a similar obligation
            until 1923, by which date the value of trust funds invested
            in titles to money had entirely disappeared.

As in other respects, so also in this, the nineteenth century relied
on the future permanence of its own happy experiences and disregarded
the warning of past misfortunes. It chose to forget that there is
no historical warrant for expecting money to be represented even by
a constant quantity of a particular metal, far less by a constant
purchasing power. Yet Money is simply that which the State declares
from time to time to be a good legal discharge of money contracts. In
1914 gold had not been the English standard for a century or the sole
standard of any other country for half a century. There is no record
of a prolonged war or a great social upheaval which has not been
accompanied by a change in the legal tender, but an almost unbroken
chronicle in every country which has a history, back to the earliest
dawn of economic record, of a progressive deterioration in the real
value of the successive legal tenders which have represented money.

Moreover, this progressive deterioration in the value of money through
history is not an accident, and has had behind it two great driving
forces--the impecuniosity of Governments and the superior political
influence of the debtor class.

The power of taxation by currency depreciation is one which has been
inherent in the State since Rome discovered it. The creation of
legal-tender has been and is a Government’s ultimate reserve; and no
State or Government is likely to decree its own bankruptcy or its own
downfall, so long as this instrument still lies at hand unused.

Besides this, as we shall see below, the benefits of a depreciating
currency are not restricted to the Government. Farmers and debtors and
all persons liable to pay fixed money dues share in the advantage.
As now in the persons of business men, so also in former ages these
classes constituted the active and constructive elements in the
economic scheme. Those secular changes, therefore, which in the past
have depreciated money, assisted the new men and emancipated them
from the dead hand; they benefited new wealth at the expense of old,
and armed enterprise against accumulation. The tendency of money to
depreciate has been in past times a weighty counterpoise against
the cumulative results of compound interest and the inheritance
of fortunes. It has been a loosening influence against the rigid
distribution of old-won wealth and the separation of ownership from
activity. By this means each generation can disinherit in part its
predecessors’ heirs; and the project of founding a perpetual fortune
must be disappointed in this way, unless the community with conscious
deliberation provides against it in some other way, more equitable and
more expedient.

At any rate, under the influence of these two forces--the financial
necessities of Governments and the political influence of the debtor
class--sometimes the one and sometimes the other, the progress of
inflation has been _continuous_, if we consider long periods, ever
since money was first devised in the sixth century B.C. Sometimes the
standard of value has depreciated of itself; failing this, debasements
have done the work.

Nevertheless it is easy at all times, as a result of the way we use
money in daily life, to forget all this and to look on money as itself
the absolute standard of value; and when, besides, the actual events
of a hundred years have not disturbed his illusions, the average man
regards what has been normal for three generations as a part of the
permanent social fabric.

The course of events during the nineteenth century favoured such ideas.
During its first quarter, the very high prices of the Napoleonic Wars
were followed by a somewhat rapid improvement in the value of money.
For the next seventy years, with some temporary fluctuations, the
tendency of prices continued to be downwards, the lowest point being
reached in 1896. But while this was the tendency as regards direction,
the remarkable feature of this long period was the relative _stability_
of the price level. Approximately the _same_ level of price ruled in or
about the years 1826, 1841, 1855, 1862, 1867, 1871, and 1915. Prices
were also level in the years 1844, 1881, and 1914. If we call the index
number of these latter years 100, we find that, for the period of close
on a century from 1826 to the outbreak of war, the maximum fluctuation
in either direction was 30 points, the index number never rising above
130 and never falling below 70. No wonder that we came to believe in
the stability of money contracts over a long period. The metal _gold_
might not possess all the theoretical advantages of an artificially
regulated standard, but it could not be tampered with and had proved
reliable in practice.

At the same time, the investor in Consols in the early part of the
century had done very well in three different ways. The “security” of
his investment had come to be considered as near absolute perfection
as was possible. Its capital value had uniformly appreciated, partly
for the reason just stated, but chiefly because the steady fall in the
rate of interest increased the number of years’ purchase of the annual
income which represented the capital.[3] And the annual money income
had a purchasing power which on the whole was increasing. If, for
example, we consider the seventy years from 1826 to 1896 (and ignore
the great improvement immediately after Waterloo), we find that the
capital value of Consols rose steadily, with only temporary set-backs,
from 79 to 109 (in spite of Goschen’s conversion from a 3 per cent
rate to a 2¾ per cent rate in 1889 and a 2½ per cent rate effective
in 1903), while the purchasing power of the annual dividends, even
after allowing for the reduced rates of interest, had increased 50
per cent. But Consols, too, had added the virtue of stability to that
of improvement. Except in years of crisis Consols never fell below 90
during the reign of Queen Victoria; and even in ’48, when thrones were
crumbling, the mean price of the year fell but 5 points. Ninety when
she ascended the throne, they reached their maximum with her in the
year of Diamond Jubilee. What wonder that our parents thought Consols a
good investment!

        [3] If (for example) the rate of interest falls from 4½ per
            cent to 3 per cent, 3 per cent Consols rise in value from
            66 to 100.

Thus there grew up during the nineteenth century a large, powerful,
and greatly respected class of persons, well-to-do individually and
very wealthy in the aggregate, who owned neither buildings, nor land,
nor businesses, nor precious metals, but titles to an annual income in
legal-tender money. In particular, that peculiar creation and pride
of the nineteenth century, the savings of the middle class, had been
mainly thus embarked. Custom and favourable experience had acquired for
such investments an unimpeachable reputation for security.

Before the war these medium fortunes had already begun to suffer some
loss (as compared with the summit of their prosperity in the middle
’nineties) from the rise in prices and also in the rate of interest.
But the monetary events which have accompanied and have followed the
war have taken from them about one-half of their real value in England,
seven-eighths in France, eleven-twelfths in Italy, and virtually the
whole in Germany and in the succession states of Austria-Hungary and
Russia.

The loss to the typical English investor of the pre-war period is
sufficiently measured by the loss to the investor in Consols. Such an
investor, as we have already seen, was steadily improving his position,
apart from temporary fluctuations, up to 1896, and in this and the
following year two maxima were reached simultaneously--both the capital
value of an annuity and also the purchasing power of money. Between
1896 and 1914, on the other hand, the investor had already suffered a
serious loss--the capital value of his annuity had fallen by about a
third, and the purchasing power of his income had also fallen by nearly
a third. This loss, however, was incurred gradually over a period of
nearly twenty years from an exceptional maximum, and did not leave
him appreciably worse off than he had been in the early ’eighties or
the early ’forties. But upon the top of this came the further swifter
loss of the war period. Between 1914 and 1920 the capital value of the
investor’s annuity again fell by more than a third, and the purchasing
power of his income by about two-thirds. In addition, the standard rate
of income tax rose from 7½ per cent in 1914 to 30 per cent in 1921.[4]
Roughly estimated in round numbers, the change may be represented thus
in terms of an index of which the base year is 1914:

            Duties.

The second column well illustrates what a splendid investment
gilt-edged stocks had been through the century from Waterloo to Mons,
even if we omit altogether the abnormal values of 1896–97. Our table
shows how the epoch of Diamond Jubilee was the culminating moment in
the prosperity of the British middle class. But it also exhibits with
the precision of figures the familiar bewailed plight of those who try
to live on the income of the same trustee investments as before the
war. The owner of consols in 1922 had a real income, one half of what
he had in 1914 and one third of what he had in 1896. The whole of the
improvement of the nineteenth century had been obliterated, and his
situation was not quite so good as it had been after Waterloo.

Some mitigating circumstances should not be overlooked. Whilst the
war was a period of the dissipation of the community’s resources
as a whole, it was a period of saving for the individuals of the
saving class, who with their larger holdings of the securities of the
Government now have an increased aggregate money claim on the receipts
of the Exchequer. Also, the investing class, which has lost money,
overlaps, both socially and by the ties of family, with the business
class, which has made money, sufficiently to break in many cases the
full severity of the loss. Moreover, in England, there has been a
substantial recovery from the low point of 1920.

But these things do not wash away the significance of the facts. The
effect of the war, and of the monetary policy which has accompanied
and followed it, has been to take away a large part of the real value
of the possessions of the investing class. The loss has been so rapid
and so intermixed in the time of its occurrence with other worse losses
that its full measure is not yet separately apprehended. But it has
effected, nevertheless, a far-reaching change in the relative position
of different classes. Throughout the Continent the pre-war savings of
the middle class, so far as they were invested in bonds, mortgages, or
bank deposits, have been largely or entirely wiped out. Nor can it be
doubted that this experience must modify social psychology towards
the practice of saving and investment. What was deemed most secure
has proved least so. He who neither spent nor “speculated,” who made
“proper provision for his family,” who sang hymns to security and
observed most straitly the morals of the edified and the respectable
injunctions of the worldly-wise,--he, indeed, who gave fewest pledges
to Fortune has yet suffered her heaviest visitations.

What moral for our present purpose should we draw from this? Chiefly, I
think, that it is not safe or fair to combine the social organisation
developed during the nineteenth century (and still retained) with a
_laisser-faire_ policy towards the value of money. It is not true that
our former arrangements have worked well. If we are to continue to draw
the voluntary savings of the community into “investments,” we must
make it a prime object of deliberate State policy that the standard of
value, in terms of which they are expressed, should be kept stable;
adjusting in other ways (calculated to touch all forms of wealth
equally and not concentrated on the relatively helpless “investors”)
the redistribution of the national wealth, if, in course of time, the
laws of inheritance and the rate of accumulation have drained too great
a proportion of the income of the active classes into the spending
control of the inactive.


2. _The Business Class._

It has long been recognised, by the business world and by economists
alike, that a period of rising prices acts as a stimulus to enterprise
and is beneficial to business men.

In the first place there is the advantage which is the counterpart
of the loss to the investing class which we have just examined. When
the value of money falls, it is evident that those persons who have
engaged to pay fixed sums of money yearly out of the profits of active
business must benefit, since their fixed money outgoings will bear a
smaller proportion than formerly to their money turnover. This benefit
persists not only during the transitional period of change, but also,
so far as old loans are concerned, when prices have settled down at
their new and higher level. For example, the farmers throughout Europe,
who had raised by mortgage the funds to purchase the land they farmed,
now find themselves almost freed from the burden at the expense of the
mortgagees.

But during the period of change, while prices are rising month by
month, the business man has a further and greater source of windfall.
Whether he is a merchant or a manufacturer, he will generally buy
before he sells, and on at least a part of his stock he will run the
risk of price changes. If, therefore, month after month his stock
appreciates on his hands, he is always selling at a better price than
he expected and securing a windfall profit upon which he had not
calculated. In such a period the business of trade becomes unduly easy.
Any one who can borrow money and is not exceptionally unlucky must make
a profit, which he may have done little to deserve. The continuous
enjoyment of such profits engenders an expectation of their renewal.
The practice of borrowing from banks is extended beyond what is normal.
If the market expects prices to rise still further, it is natural that
stocks of commodities should be held speculatively for the rise, and
for a time the mere expectation of a rise is sufficient, by inducing
speculative purchases, to produce one.

Take, for example, the _Statist_ index number for raw materials month
by month from April, 1919, to March, 1920:

  April, 1919        100
  May                108
  June               112
  July               117
  August             120
  September          121
  October            127
  November           131
  December           135
  January, 1920      142
  February           150
  March              146

It follows from this table that a man, who borrowed money from his
banker and used the proceeds to purchase raw materials selected at
random, stood to make a profit in every single month of this period
with the exception of the last, and would have cleared 46 per cent on
the average of the year. Yet bankers were not charging at this time
above 7 per cent for their advances, leaving a clear profit of between
30 and 40 per cent per annum, without the exercise of any particular
skill, to any person lucky enough to have embarked on these courses.
How much more were the opportunities of persons whose business position
and expert knowledge enabled them to exercise intelligent anticipation
as to the probable course of prices of particular commodities! Yet any
dealer in or user of raw materials on a large scale who knew his trade
was thus situated. The profits of certain kinds of business to the man
who has a little skill or some luck are certain in such a period to
be inordinate. Great fortunes may be made in a few months. But apart
from all such, the steady-going business man, who would be pained and
insulted at the thought of being designated speculator or profiteer,
may find windfall profits dropping into his lap which he has neither
sought nor desired.

Economists draw an instructive distinction between what are termed the
“money” rate of interest and the “real” rate of interest. If a sum of
money worth 100 in terms of commodities at the time when the loan is
made is lent for a year at 5 per cent interest, and is only worth 90
in terms of commodities at the end of the year, the lender receives
back, including his interest, what is only worth 94½. This is expressed
by saying that while the _money_ rate of interest was 5 per cent, the
_real_ rate of interest had actually been negative and equal to _minus_
5½ per cent. In the same way, if at the end of the period the value of
money had risen and the capital sum lent had come to be worth 110 in
terms of commodities, while the _money_ rate of interest would still be
5 per cent the _real_ rate of interest would have been 15½ per cent.

Such considerations, even though they are not explicitly present to the
minds of the business world, are far from being academic. The business
world may speak, and even think, as though the money rate of interest
could be considered by itself, without reference to the real rate. But
it does not act so. The merchant or manufacturer, who is calculating
whether a 7 per cent bank rate is so onerous as to compel him to
curtail his operations, is very much influenced by his anticipations
about the prospective price of the commodity in which he is interested.

Thus, when prices are rising, the business man who borrows money is
able to repay the lender with what, in terms of real value, not only
represents no interest, but is even less than the capital originally
advanced; that is, the real rate of interest falls to a negative value,
and the borrower reaps a corresponding benefit. It is true that, in so
far as a rise of prices is foreseen, attempts to get advantage from
this by increased borrowing force the money rates of interest to move
upwards. It is for this reason, amongst others, that a high bank rate
should be associated with a period of rising prices, and a low bank
rate with a period of falling prices. The apparent abnormality of the
money rate of interest at such times is merely the other side of the
attempt of the real rate of interest to steady itself. Nevertheless in
a period of rapidly changing prices, the money rate of interest seldom
adjusts itself adequately or fast enough to prevent the real rate from
becoming abnormal. For it is not the _fact_ of a given rise of prices,
but the _expectation_ of a rise compounded of the various possible
price-movements and the estimated probability of each, which affects
money rates; and in countries where the currency has not collapsed
completely, there has seldom or never existed a sufficient general
confidence in a further rise or fall of prices to cause the short-money
rate of interest to rise above 10 per cent per annum, or to fall below
1 per cent.[6] A fluctuation of this order is not sufficient to balance
a movement of prices, up or down, of more than (say) 5 per cent per
annum,--a rate which the actual price movement has frequently exceeded.

        [6] The merchant, who borrows money in order to take advantage
            of a prospective high real rate of interest, has to act
            in advance of the rise in prices, and is calculating on a
            probability, not upon a certainty, with the result that
            he will be deterred by a movement in the money rate of
            interest of much less magnitude than the contrary movement
            in the real rate of interest, upon which indeed he is
            reckoning, yet is not reckoning with certainty.

Germany has recently provided an illustration of the extraordinary
degree in which the money rate of interest can rise in its endeavour
to keep up with the real rate, when prices have continued to rise for
so long and with such violence that, rightly or wrongly, every one
believes that they will continue to rise further. Yet even there the
money rate of interest has never risen high enough to keep pace with
the rise of prices. In the autumn of 1922, the full effects were just
becoming visible of the long preceding period during which the real
rate of interest in Germany had reached a high negative figure, that
is to say during which any one who could borrow marks and turn them
into assets would have found at the end of any given period that the
appreciation in the mark-value of the assets was far greater than
the interest he had to pay for borrowing them. By this means great
fortunes were snatched out of general calamity; and those made most
who had seen first, that the right game was to borrow and to borrow
and to borrow, and thus secure the difference between the real rate
of interest and the money rate. But after this had been good business
for many months, every one began to take a hand, with belated results
on the money rate of interest. At that time, with a nominal Reichsbank
rate of 8 per cent, the effective gilt-edged rate for short loans had
risen to 22 per cent per annum. During the first half of 1923, the
rate of the Reichsbank itself rose to 24 per cent, and subsequently
to 30, and finally 108 per cent, whilst the market rate fluctuated
violently at preposterous figures, reaching at times 3 per cent _per
week_ for certain types of loan. With the final currency collapse of
July-September 1923, the open market rate was altogether demoralised,
and reached figures of 100 per cent per month. In face, however, of the
rate of currency depreciation, even such figures were inadequate, and
the bold borrower was still making money.

In Hungary, Poland, and Russia--wherever prices were expected to
collapse yet further--the same phenomenon was present, exhibiting
as through a microscope what takes place everywhere when prices are
expected to rise.

On the other hand, when prices are falling 30 to 40 per cent between
the average of one year and that of the next, as they were in Great
Britain and in the United States during 1921, even a bank rate of 1
per cent would have been oppressive to business, since it would have
corresponded to a very high rate of real interest. Any one who could
have foreseen the movement even partially would have done well for
himself by selling out his assets and staying out of business for the
time being.

But if the depreciation of money is a source of gain to the business
man, it is also the occasion of opprobrium. To the consumer the
business man’s exceptional profits appear as the cause (instead of the
consequence) of the hated rise of prices. Amidst the rapid fluctuations
of his fortunes he himself loses his conservative instincts, and begins
to think more of the large gains of the moment than of the lesser, but
permanent, profits of normal business. The welfare of his enterprise
in the relatively distant future weighs less with him than before,
and thoughts are excited of a quick fortune and clearing out. His
excessive gains have come to him unsought and without fault or design
on his part, but once acquired he does not lightly surrender them, and
will struggle to retain his booty. With such impulses and so placed,
the business man is himself not free from a suppressed uneasiness.
In his heart he loses his former self-confidence in his relation to
society, in his utility and necessity in the economic scheme. He fears
the future of his business and his class, and the less secure he feels
his fortune to be the tighter he clings to it. The business man, the
prop of society and the builder of the future, to whose activities and
rewards there had been accorded, not long ago, an almost religious
sanction, he of all men and classes most respectable, praiseworthy and
necessary, with whom interference was not only disastrous but almost
impious, was now to suffer sidelong glances, to feel himself suspected
and attacked, the victim of unjust and injurious laws,--to become, and
know himself half-guilty, a profiteer.

No man of spirit will consent to remain poor if he believes his betters
to have gained their goods by lucky gambling. To convert the business
man into the profiteer is to strike a blow at capitalism, because it
destroys the psychological equilibrium which permits the perpetuance
of unequal rewards. The economic doctrine of normal profits,
vaguely apprehended by every one, is a necessary condition for the
justification of capitalism. The business man is only tolerable so long
as his gains can be held to bear some relation to what, roughly and in
some sense, his activities have contributed to society.

This, then, is the second disturbance to the existing economic order
for which the depreciation of money is responsible. If the fall in the
value of money discourages investment, it also discredits enterprise.

Not that the business man was allowed, even during the period of boom,
to retain the whole of his exceptional profits. A host of popular
remedies vainly attempted to cure the evils of the day; which remedies
themselves--subsidies, price and rent fixing, profiteer hunting, and
excess profits duties--eventually became not the least part of the
evils.

In due course came the depression, with falling prices, which operate
on those who hold stocks in a manner exactly opposite to rising
prices. Excessive losses, bearing no relation to the efficiency of
the business, took the place of windfall gains; and the effort of
every one to hold as small stocks as possible brought industry to a
standstill, just as previously their efforts to accumulate stocks had
over-stimulated it. Unemployment succeeded Profiteering as the problem
of the hour. But whilst the cyclical movement of trade and credit has,
in the good-currency countries, partly reversed, for the time being at
least, the great rise of 1920, it has, in the countries of continuing
inflation, made no more than a ripple on the rapids of depreciation.


3. _The Earner._

It has been a commonplace of economic text-books that wages tend to
lag behind prices, with the result that the real earnings of the
wage-earner are diminished during a period of rising prices. This
has often been true in the past, and may be true even now of certain
classes of labour which are ill-placed or ill-organised for improving
their position. But in Great Britain, at any rate, and in the United
States also, some important sections of labour were able to take
advantage of the situation not only to obtain money wages equivalent
in purchasing power to what they had before, but to secure a real
improvement, to combine this with a diminution in their hours of work
(and, so far, of the work done), and to accomplish this (in the case
of Great Britain) at a time when the total wealth of the community as
a whole had suffered a decrease. This reversal of the usual course has
not been due to an accident and is traceable to definite causes.

The organisation of certain classes of labour--railwaymen, miners,
dockers, and others--for the purpose of securing wage increases is
better than it was. Life in the army, perhaps for the first time in
the history of wars, raised in many respects the conventional standard
of requirements,--the soldier was better clothed, better shod, and
often better fed than the labourer, and his wife, adding in war time a
separation allowance to new opportunities to earn, had also enlarged
her ideas.

But these influences, while they would have supplied the motive,
might have lacked the means to the result if it had not been for
another factor--the windfalls of the profiteer. The fact that the
business man had been gaining, and gaining notoriously, considerable
windfall profits in excess of the normal profits of trade, laid him
open to pressure, not only from his employees but from public opinion
generally; and enabled him to meet this pressure without financial
difficulty. In fact, it was worth his while to pay ransom, and to share
with his workmen the good fortune of the day.

Thus the working classes improved their _relative_ position in the
years following the war, as against all other classes except that of
the “profiteers.” In some important cases they improved their absolute
position--that is to say, account being taken of shorter hours,
increased money wages, and higher prices, some sections of the working
classes secured for themselves a higher real remuneration for each unit
of effort or work done. But we cannot estimate the _stability_ of this
state of affairs, as contrasted with its desirability, unless we know
the source from which the increased reward of the working classes was
drawn. Was it due to a permanent modification of the economic factors
which determine the distribution of the national product between
different classes? Or was it due to some temporary and exhaustible
influence connected with inflation and with the resulting disturbance
in the standard of value?

A violent disturbance of the standard of value obscures the true
situation, and for a time one class can benefit at the expense
of another surreptitiously and without producing immediately the
inevitable reaction. In such conditions a country can without knowing
it expend in current consumption those savings which it thinks it is
investing for the future; and it can even trench on existing capital or
fail to make good its current depreciation. When the value of money is
greatly fluctuating, the distinction between capital and income becomes
confused. It is one of the evils of a depreciating currency that it
enables a community to live on its capital unawares. The increasing
_money_ value of the community’s capital goods obscures temporarily a
diminution in the real quantity of the stock.

The period of depression has exacted its penalty from the working
classes more in the form of unemployment than by a lowering of real
wages, and State assistance to the unemployed has greatly moderated
even this penalty. Money wages have followed prices downwards. But
the depression of 1921–22 did not reverse or even greatly diminish
the relative advantage gained by the working classes over the middle
class during the previous years. In 1923 British wage rates stood at an
appreciably higher level above the pre-war rates than did the cost of
living, if allowance is made for the shorter hours worked.

In Germany and Austria also, but in a far greater degree than in
England or in France, the change in the value of money has thrown the
burden of hard circumstances on the middle class, and hitherto the
labouring class have by no means supported their full proportionate
share. If it be true that university professors in Germany have some
responsibility for the atmosphere which bred war, their class has paid
the penalty. The effects of the impoverishment, throughout Europe,
of the middle class, out of which most good things have sprung, must
slowly accumulate in a decay of Science and Art.

       *       *       *       *       *

We conclude that Inflation redistributes wealth in a manner very
injurious to the investor, very beneficial to the business man, and
probably, in modern industrial conditions, beneficial on the whole
to the earner. Its most striking consequence is its _injustice_ to
those who in good faith have committed their savings to titles to
money rather than to things. But injustice on such a scale has further
consequences. The above discussion suggests that the diminution in the
production of wealth which has taken place in Europe since the war
has been, to a certain extent, at the expense, not of the consumption
of any class, but of the accumulation of capital. Moreover, Inflation
has not only diminished the capacity of the investing class to save
but has destroyed the atmosphere of confidence which is a condition
of the willingness to save. Yet a growing population requires, for
the maintenance of the same standard of life, a proportionate growth
of capital. In Great Britain for many years to come, regardless of
what the birth-rate may be from now onwards (and at the present time
the number of births per day is nearly double the number of deaths),
upwards of 250,000 new labourers will enter the labour market annually
in excess of those going out of it. To maintain this growing body of
labour at the same standard of life as before, we require not merely
growing markets but a growing capital equipment. In order to keep our
standards from deterioration, the national capital must grow as fast
as the national labour supply, which means new savings of at least
£250,000,000[7] per annum at present. The favourable conditions for
saving which existed in the nineteenth century, even though we smile at
them, provided a proportionate growth between capital and population.
The disturbance of the pre-existing balance between classes, which in
its origins is largely traceable to the changes in the value of money,
may have destroyed these favourable conditions.

        [7] That is to say, it costs not less than £1000 in new capital
            outlay to equip a working man with organisation and
            appliances, which will render his labour efficient, and to
            house and supply himself and his family. Indeed this is
            probably an underestimate.

On the other hand Deflation, as we shall see in the second section
of the next chapter, is liable, in these days of huge national debts
expressed in legal-tender money, to overturn the balance so far the
other way in the interests of the _rentier_, that the burden of
taxation becomes intolerable on the productive classes of the community.


II.--CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF MONEY, AS AFFECTING PRODUCTION.

If, for any reason right or wrong, the business world _expects_ that
prices will fall, the processes of production tend to be inhibited; and
if it expects that prices will rise, they tend to be over-stimulated. A
fluctuation in the measuring-rod of value does not alter in the least
the wealth of the world, the needs of the world, or the productive
capacity of the world. It ought not, therefore, to affect the character
or the volume of what is produced. A movement of _relative_ prices,
that is to say of the comparative prices of different commodities,
_ought_ to influence the character of production, because it is an
indication that various commodities are not being produced in the
exactly right proportions. But this is not true of a change, as such,
in the _general_ price level.

The fact that the expectation of changes in the _general_ price
level affects the processes of production, is deeply rooted in the
peculiarities of the existing economic organisation of society, partly
in those described in the preceding sections of this chapter, partly
in others to be mentioned in a moment. We have already seen that a
change in the general level of prices, that is to say a change in
the measuring-rod, which fixes the obligation of the borrowers of
money (who make the decisions which set production in motion) to the
lenders (who are inactive once they have lent their money), effects a
redistribution of real wealth between the two groups. Furthermore, the
active group can, if they foresee such a change, alter their action in
advance in such a way as to minimise their losses to the other group
or to increase their gains from it, if and when the expected change
in the value of money occurs. If they expect a fall, it may pay them,
as a group, to damp production down, although such enforced idleness
impoverishes society as a whole. If they expect a rise, it may pay
them to increase their borrowings and to swell production beyond the
point where the real return is just sufficient to recompense society
as a whole for the effort made. Sometimes, of course, a change in the
measuring-rod, especially if it is unforeseen, may benefit one group
at the expense of the other disproportionately to any influence it
exerts on the volume of production; but the tendency, in so far as the
active group anticipate a change, will be as I have described it.[8]
This is simply to say that the intensity of production is largely
governed in existing conditions by the anticipated real profit of the
_entrepreneur_. Yet this criterion is the right one for the community
as a whole only when the delicate adjustment of interests is not upset
by fluctuations in the standard of value.

        [8] The interests of the salaried and wage-earning classes
            will, in so far as their salaries and wages tend to be
            steadier in money-value than in real-value, coincide with
            those of the inactive capitalist group. The interests
            of the consumer will, in so far as he can vary the
            distribution of his floating resources between cash and
            goods purchased in advance of consumption, coincide with
            those of the active capitalist group; and his decisions,
            made in his own interests, may serve to reinforce the
            effect of those of the latter. But that the interests of
            the same individual will often be those of one of the
            groups in one of his capacities and of the other in another
            of his capacities, does not save the situation or affect
            the argument. For his losses in one capacity depend only
            infinitesimally on him personally refraining from action
            in his other capacity. The facts, that a man is a cannibal
            at home and eaten abroad, do not cancel out to render him
            innocuous and safe.

But there is a further reason, connected with the above but
nevertheless distinct, why modern methods of production require a
stable standard,--a reason springing to a certain extent out of the
character of the social organisation described above, but aggravated
by the technical methods of present-day productive processes. With the
development of international trade, involving great distances between
the place of original production and the place of final consumption,
and with the increased complication of the technical processes of
manufacture, the amount of _risk_ which attaches to the undertaking
of production and the length of time through which this risk must be
carried are much greater than they would be in a comparatively small
self-contained community. Even in agriculture, whilst the risk to
the consumer is diminished by drawing supplies from many different
sources, which average the fluctuations of the seasons, the risk to the
agricultural producer is increased, since, when his crop falls below
his expectations in volume, he may fail to be compensated by a higher
price. This increased risk is the price which producers have to pay for
the other advantages of a high degree of specialisation and for the
variety of their markets and their sources of supply.

The provision of adequate facilities for the carrying of this risk at a
moderate cost is one of the greatest of the problems of modern economic
life, and one of those which so far have been least satisfactorily
solved. The business of keeping the productive machine in continuous
operation (and thereby avoiding unemployment) would be greatly
simplified if this risk could be diminished or if we could devise a
better means of insurance against it for the individual _entrepreneur_.

A considerable part of the risk arises out of fluctuations in the
_relative_ value of a commodity compared with that of commodities in
general during the interval which must elapse between the commencement
of production and the time of consumption. This part of the risk is
independent of the vagaries of money, and must be tackled by methods
with which we are not concerned here. But there is also a considerable
risk directly arising out of instability in the value of money. During
the lengthy process of production the business world is incurring
outgoings in terms of _money_--paying out in money for wages and
other expenses of production--in the expectation of recouping this
outlay by disposing of the product for _money_ at a later date. That
is to say, the business world as a whole must always be in a position
where it stands to gain by a rise of price and to lose by a fall of
price. Whether it likes it or not, the technique of production under a
_régime_ of money-contract forces the business world always to carry
a big speculative position; and if it is reluctant to carry this
position, the productive process must be slackened. The argument is
not affected by the fact that there is some degree of specialisation
of function within the business world, in so far as the professional
speculator comes to the assistance of the producer proper by taking
over from him a part of his risk.

Now it follows from this, not merely that the _actual occurrence_ of
price changes profits some classes and injures others (which has been
the theme of the first section of this chapter), but that a _general
fear_ of falling prices may inhibit the productive process altogether.
For if prices are expected to fall, not enough risk-takers can be
found who are willing to carry a speculative “bull” position, and this
means that _entrepreneurs_ will be reluctant to embark on lengthy
productive processes involving a money outlay long in advance of money
recoupment,--whence unemployment. The _fact_ of falling prices injures
_entrepreneurs_; consequently the _fear_ of falling prices causes them
to protect themselves by curtailing their operations; yet it is upon
the aggregate of their individual estimations of the risk, and their
willingness to run the risk, that the activity of production and of
employment mainly depends.

There is a further aggravation of the case, in that an expectation
about the course of prices tends, if it is widely held, to be
cumulative in its results up to a certain point. If prices are
expected to rise and the business world acts on this expectation,
that very fact causes them to rise for a time and, by verifying the
expectation, reinforces it; and similarly, if it expects them to fall.
Thus a comparatively weak initial impetus may be adequate to produce a
considerable fluctuation.

Three generations of economists have recognised that certain influences
produce a progressive and continuing change in the value of money, that
others produce in it an oscillatory movement, and that the latter act
cumulatively in their initial stages but produce the conditions for
a reaction after a certain point. But their investigations into the
oscillatory movements have been chiefly confined, until lately, to the
question what kind of cause is responsible for the initial impetus.
Some have been fascinated by the idea that the initial cause is always
the same and is astronomically regular in the times of its appearance.
Others have maintained, more plausibly, that sometimes one thing
operates and sometimes another.

It is one of the objects of this book to urge that the best way to cure
this mortal disease of individualism is to provide that there shall
never exist any confident expectation either that prices generally
are going to fall or that they are going to rise; and also that there
shall be no serious risk that a movement, if it does occur, will be
a big one. If, unexpectedly and accidentally, a moderate movement
were to occur, wealth, though it might be redistributed, would not be
diminished thereby.

To procure this result by removing all possible influences towards
an initial movement, whether such influences are to be found in the
skies only or everywhere, would seem to be a hopeless enterprise. The
remedy would lie, rather, in so controlling the standard of value that,
whenever something occurred which, left to itself, would create an
expectation of a change in the general level of prices, the controlling
authority should take steps to counteract this expectation by setting
in motion some factor of a contrary tendency. Even if such a policy
were not wholly successful, either in counteracting expectations
or in avoiding actual movements, it would be an improvement on the
policy of sitting quietly by, whilst a standard of value, governed by
chance causes and deliberately removed from central control, produces
expectations which paralyse or intoxicate the government of production.

       *       *       *       *       *

We see, therefore, that rising prices and falling prices each have
their characteristic disadvantage. The Inflation which causes the
former means Injustice to individuals and to classes,--particularly
to investors; and is therefore unfavourable to saving. The Deflation
which causes falling prices means Impoverishment to labour and to
enterprise by leading _entrepreneurs_ to restrict production, in their
endeavour to avoid loss to themselves; and is therefore disastrous to
employment. The counterparts are, of course, also true,--namely that
Deflation means Injustice to borrowers, and that Inflation leads to
the over-stimulation of industrial activity. But these results are not
so marked as those emphasised above, because borrowers are in a better
position to protect themselves from the worst effects of Deflation than
lenders are to protect themselves from those of Inflation, and because
labour is in a better position to protect itself from over-exertion in
good times than from under-employment in bad times.

Thus Inflation is unjust and Deflation is inexpedient. Of the two
perhaps Deflation is, if we rule out exaggerated inflations such as
that of Germany, the worse; because it is worse, in an impoverished
world, to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the _rentier_.
But it is not necessary that we should weigh one evil against the
other. It is easier to agree that both are evils to be shunned. The
Individualistic Capitalism of to-day, precisely because it entrusts
saving to the individual investor and production to the individual
employer, _presumes_ a stable measuring-rod of value, and cannot be
efficient--perhaps cannot survive--without one.

For these grave causes we must free ourselves from the deep distrust
which exists against allowing the regulation of the standard of value
to be the subject of _deliberate decision_. We can no longer afford to
leave it in the category of which the distinguishing characteristics
are possessed in different degrees by the weather, the birth-rate, and
the Constitution,--matters which are settled by natural causes, or
are the resultant of the separate action of many individuals acting
independently, or require a Revolution to change them.




CHAPTER II

PUBLIC FINANCE AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF MONEY


I. _Inflation as a Method of Taxation_

A Government can live for a long time, even the German Government or
the Russian Government, by printing paper money. That is to say, it can
by this means secure the command over real resources,--resources just
as real as those obtained by taxation. The method is condemned, but
its efficacy, up to a point, must be admitted. A Government can live
by this means when it can live by no other. It is the form of taxation
which the public find hardest to evade and even the weakest Government
can enforce, when it can enforce nothing else. Of this character have
been the progressive and catastrophic inflations practised in Central
and Eastern Europe, as distinguished from the limited and oscillatory
inflations, experienced for example in Great Britain and the United
States, which have been examined in the preceding chapter.

The Quantity Theory of Money states that the amount of cash which the
community requires, _assuming certain habits of business and of banking
to be established_, and assuming also a given level and distribution
of wealth, depends on the level of prices. If the consumption and
production of actual goods are unaltered but prices and wages are
doubled, then twice as much cash as before is required to do the
business. The truth of this, properly explained and qualified, it
is foolish to deny. The Theory infers from this that the _aggregate
real value_ of all the paper money in circulation remains more
or less the same, irrespective of the _number of units_ of it in
circulation, provided the habits and prosperity of the people are not
changed,--_i.e._ the community retains in the shape of cash the command
over a more or less constant amount of real wealth, which is the same
thing as to say that the total quantity of money in circulation has a
more or less fixed purchasing power.[9]

        [9] See also Chapter III., Section I.

Let us suppose that there are in circulation 9,000,000 currency notes,
and that they have altogether a value equivalent to 36,000,000 gold
dollars.[10] Suppose that the Government prints a further 3,000,000
notes, so that the amount of currency is now 12,000,000; then, in
accordance with the above theory, the 12,000,000 notes are still only
equivalent to $36,000,000. In the first state of affairs, therefore,
each note = $4, and in the second state of affairs each note = $3.
Consequently the 9,000,000 notes originally held by the public are now
worth $27,000,000 instead of $36,000,000, and the 3,000,000 notes newly
issued by the Government are worth $9,000,000. Thus by the process of
printing the additional notes the Government has transferred from the
public to itself an amount of resources equal to $9,000,000, just as
successfully as if it had raised this sum in taxation.

       [10] It will simplify the argument to ignore the fact that
            the value of gold in terms of commodities is itself a
            fluctuating one, and to treat the value of a currency in
            terms of gold as a rough measure of its value in terms of
            “real resources” generally.

On whom has the tax fallen? Clearly on the holders of the original
9,000,000 notes, whose notes are now worth 25 per cent less than they
were before. The inflation has amounted to a tax of 25 per cent on all
holders of notes in proportion to their holdings. The burden of the tax
is well spread, cannot be evaded, costs nothing to collect, and falls,
in a rough sort of way, in proportion to the wealth of the victim. No
wonder its superficial advantages have attracted Ministers of Finance.

Temporarily, the yield of the tax is even a little better for the
Government than by the above calculation. For the new notes can be
passed off at first at the same value as though there were still only
9,000,000 notes altogether. It is only after the new notes get into
circulation and people begin to spend them that they realise that the
notes are worth less than before.

What is there to prevent the Government from repeating this process
over and over again? The reader must observe that the aggregate note
issue is still worth $36,000,000. If, therefore, the Government now
prints a further 4,000,000 notes, there will be 16,000,000 notes
altogether, which by the same argument as before are worth $2.25 each
instead of $3, and by issuing the 4,000,000 notes the Government has,
just as before, transferred an amount of resources equal to $9,000,000
from the public to itself. The holders of notes have again suffered a
tax of 25 per cent in proportion to their holdings.

Like other forms of taxation, these exactions, if overdone and out of
proportion to the wealth of the community, must diminish its prosperity
and lower its standards, so that at the lower standard of life the
aggregate value of the currency may fall and still be enough to go
round. But this effect cannot interfere very much with the efficacy of
taxing by inflation. Even if the aggregate real value of the currency
falls for these reasons to a half or two-thirds of what it was before,
which represents a tremendous lowering of the standards of life, this
only means that the quantity of notes which the Government must issue
in order to obtain a given result must be raised proportionately. It
remains true that by this means the Government can still secure for
itself a large share of the available surplus of the community.

Has the public in the last resort no remedy, no means of protecting
itself against these ingenious depredations? It has only one
remedy,--to change its habits in the use of money. The initial
assumption on which our argument rested was that the community did
_not_ change its habits in the use of money.

Experience shows that the public generally is very slow to grasp the
situation and embrace the remedy. Indeed, at first there may be a
change of habit in the wrong direction, which actually facilitates the
Government’s operations. The public is so much accustomed to thinking
of money as the ultimate standard, that, when prices begin to rise,
believing that the rise must be temporary, they tend to hoard their
money and to postpone purchases, with the result that they hold in
monetary form a _larger_ aggregate of real value than before. And,
similarly, when the fall in the real value of the money is reflected
in the exchanges, foreigners, thinking that the fall is abnormal and
temporary, purchase the money for the purpose of hoarding it.

But sooner or later the second phase sets in. The public discover that
it is the holders of notes who suffer taxation and defray the expenses
of government, and they begin to change their habits and to economise
in their holding of notes. They can do this in various ways:--(1)
instead of keeping some part of their ultimate reserves in money they
can spend this money on durable objects, jewellery or household goods,
and keep their reserves in this form instead; (2) they can reduce the
amount of till-money and pocket-money that they keep and the average
length of time for which they keep it,[11] even at the cost of great
personal inconvenience; and (3) they can employ foreign money in many
transactions where it would have been more natural and convenient to
use their own.

       [11] In Moscow the unwillingness to hold money except for the
            shortest possible time reached at one period a fantastic
            intensity. If a grocer sold a pound of cheese, he ran off
            with the roubles as fast as his legs could carry him to
            the Central Market to replenish his stocks by changing
            them into cheese again, lest they lost their value before
            he got there; thus justifying the prevision of economists
            in naming the phenomenon “velocity of circulation”! In
            Vienna, during the period of collapse, mushroom exchange
            banks sprang up at every street corner, where you could
            change your krone into Zurich francs within a few minutes
            of receiving them, and so avoid the risk of loss during the
            time it would take you to reach your usual bank. It became
            a seasonable witticism to allege that a prudent man at a
            café ordering a bock of beer should order a second bock at
            the same time, even at the expense of drinking it tepid,
            lest the price should rise meanwhile.

By these means they can get along and do their business with an amount
of notes having an aggregate real value substantially less than
before. For example, the notes in circulation become worth altogether
$20,000,000 instead of $36,000,000, with the result that the next
inflationary levy by the Government, falling on a smaller amount, must
be at a greater rate in order to yield a given sum.

When the public take alarm faster than they can change their habits,
and, in their efforts to avoid loss, run down the amount of real
resources, which they hold in the form of money, _below_ the working
minimum, seeking to supply their daily needs for cash by borrowing,
they get penalised, as in Germany in 1923, by prodigious rates of
money-interest. The rates rise, as we have seen in the previous
chapter, until the rate of interest on money equals or exceeds the
anticipated rate of the depreciation of money. Indeed it is always
likely, when money is rapidly depreciating, that there will be
recurrent periods of scarcity of currency, because the public, in their
anxiety not to hold too much money, will fail to provide themselves
even with the minimum which they will require in practice.

Whilst economists have sometimes described these phenomena in terms of
an increase in the velocity of circulation due to loss of confidence
in the currency; nevertheless there are not, I think, many passages in
economic literature where the matter is clearly analysed. Professor
Cannan’s article on “The Application of the Apparatus of Supply and
Demand to Units of Currency” (_Economic Journal_, December 1921) is
one of the most noteworthy. He points out that the common assumption
that “the elasticity of demand for money is unity” is equivalent to
the assertion that a mere variation in the quantity of money does
not affect the willingness and habits of the public as holders of
purchasing power in that form. But in extreme cases this assumption
does not hold; for if it did, there would be no limit to the sums which
the Government could extract from the public by means of inflation.
It is, therefore, unsafe to assume that the elasticity of demand is
necessarily unity. Professor Lehfeldt followed this up in a subsequent
issue of the _Economic Journal_ (December 1922) by a calculation of
the actual elasticity of demand for money in some recent instances.
He found that between July 1920 and April 1922, the elasticity of
demand for money fell to an average of about ·73 in Austria, ·67 in
Poland, and ·5 in Germany. Thus in the last stages of inflation the
prodigious increase in the velocity of circulation may have as much,
or more, effect in raising prices and depreciating the exchanges than
the increase in the volume of notes. The note-issuing authorities often
cry out against what they regard as the unfair and anomalous fact of
the notes falling in value _more_ than in proportion to their increased
volume. Yet it is nothing of the kind; it is merely the result of the
one method to evade a crushing burden left open to the public, who
discover for themselves, sooner than the financiers, that the law of
unit elasticity in their demand for money can be escaped.

Nevertheless, it is evident that so long as the public use money at
all, the Government can continue to raise resources by inflation.
Moreover, the conveniences of using money in daily life are so great
that the public are prepared, rather than forego them, to pay the
inflationary tax, provided it is not raised to a prohibitive level.
Like other conveniences of life the use of money is taxable, and,
although for various reasons this particular form of taxation is
highly inexpedient, a Government can get resources by a _continuous_
practice of inflation, even when this is foreseen by the public
generally, unless the sums they seek to raise in this way are very
grossly excessive. Just as a toll can be levied on the use of roads or
a turnover tax on business transactions, so also on the use of money.
The higher the toll and the tax, the less traffic on the roads, and
the less business transacted, so also the less money carried. But
some traffic is so indispensable, some business so profitable, some
money-payments so convenient, that only a very high levy will stop
completely all traffic, all business, all payments. A Government has
to remember, however, that even if a tax is not prohibitive it may be
unprofitable, and that a medium, rather than an extreme, imposition
will yield the greatest gain.

Suppose that the rate of inflation is such that the value of the money
falls by half every year, and suppose that the cash used by the public
for retail purchases in shops is turned over 100 times a year (_i.e._
stays in one pocket for half a week on the average); then this is
only equivalent to a turnover tax of ½ per cent on each transaction.
The public will gladly pay such a tax rather than suffer the trouble
and inconvenience of barter with trams and tradesmen. Even if the
value of the money falls by half every month, the public, by keeping
their pocket-money so low that they turn it over once a day on the
average instead of only twice a week, can still keep the tax down to
the equivalent of less than 2 per cent on each transaction, or more
precisely 4d. in the £. Even such a terrific rate of depreciation as
this is not sufficient, therefore, to counterbalance the advantages
of using money rather than barter in the trifling business of daily
life. This is the explanation why, even in Germany and in Russia, the
Government’s notes remained current for many retail transactions.

For certain other purposes, however, to which money is put in a modern
community, the inflationary tax becomes prohibitive at a much earlier
stage. As a store of value, for example, money is rapidly discarded, as
soon as further depreciation is confidently anticipated. As a unit of
account, for contracts and for balance sheets, it quickly becomes worse
than useless, although for such purposes the privilege of the current
money as legal-tender for the discharge of debts stands in the way of
its being discarded as soon as it ought to be.

In the last phase, when the use of the legal-tender money has been
discarded for all purposes except trifling out-of-pocket expenditure,
inflationary taxation has at last defeated itself. For in that case the
total value of the note issue, which is sufficient to meet the public’s
minimum requirements, amounts to a figure relatively so trifling that
the amount of resources which the government can hope to raise by yet
further inflation--without pushing it to a point at which the money
will be discarded even for out-of-pocket trifles--is correspondingly
small. Thus at last, unless it is employed with some measure of
moderation, this potent instrument of governmental exaction breaks in
the hands of those that use it, and leaves them at the same time with
the rest of their fiscal system in total ruins;--out of which, in the
ebb and flow of the economic life of nations, may emerge once more a
reformed and admirable system. The chervonetz of Moscow and the krone
of Vienna are already stabler units than the franc or the lira.

All these matters can be illustrated from the recent experiences of
Germany, Austria, and Russia. The following tables show the gold value

The characteristics of each phase emerge clearly. The tables show,
first of all, how quickly, during the period of collapse, the rate
of the depreciation of the value of the money outstrips the rate of
the inflation of its volume. During the collapse of the German mark
beginning with December 1920, the rate of depreciation proceeded
for some time roughly twice as fast as that of the inflation, and
eventually by June 1923, when the volume of the note-issue had
increased 200-fold compared with December 1920, the value of a paper
mark had fallen 2500-fold. The figures given above for Austria begin
at a rather later stage of the _débâcle_. But if we equate Austria in
June 1920 to Germany in December 1920, the progress of events between
that date and September 1922 is roughly comparable to that in Germany
between December 1920 and May 1923. The figures for Russia between
January 1919 and the early part of 1923 also exhibit the same general
features.

These tables all commence after a considerable depreciation had
already occurred and the gold-value of the aggregate note-issue had
fallen considerably below the normal.[12] Nevertheless their earliest
entries still belong to the period when an eventual recovery was still
widely anticipated and the general public had not at all appreciated
what they were in for. They indicate that as the situation develops
from this point onwards and the use of money is discarded except for
retail transactions, the aggregate value of the note-issue falls by
about four-fifths. As the result of extreme panic or depression a
further fall may occur for a time; but, unless the money is discarded
altogether, a minimum is reached eventually from which the least
favourable circumstance will cause a sharp recovery.

       [12] The pre-war currency of Germany was estimated at about 6
            milliard gold marks (£300,000,000), or nearly £5 per head.

The temporary recovery in Germany after the collapse of February 1923
exhibited how a point may come when, if the money is to continue in
use at all, a bottom is reached and a technical position is created in
which some recovery is possible. When the gold value of the currency
has fallen to a very low figure, it is easy for the Government, if
it has any external resources at all, to give sufficient support to
prevent the exchange from falling further for the time being. And since
by that time the public will have carried their attempts to economise
the use of money to a pitch of inconvenience which it is impracticable
to continue, even a moderate weakening in the degree of their distrust
of the future value of the money will lead to some increase in their
use of it; with the result that the aggregate value of the note issue
will tend to recover. By February 1923 these conditions existed in
Germany in a high degree. The German Government was able within two
months, in the face of most adverse political conditions, to double the
exchange-value of the mark whilst simultaneously more than doubling
the note circulation. Even so the gold value of the note issue was
only brought back to what it had been six months earlier; and if even
a moderate degree of confidence had been restored, it might have been
possible to bring the value of the note circulation of Germany up to
(say) 2 milliard gold marks (£100,000,000) at least, which is probably
about the lowest figure at which it can stand permanently, unless every
one is to put himself to intolerable inconvenience in his efforts to
hold as little money as possible. Incidentally the Government is able
during the period of recovery to obtain, once more, through the issue
of notes the command over a considerable amount of real resources.

In Austria, where, at the date of writing, the exchange has been
stabilised for a year, the same phenomenon has been apparent with
the growth of confidence, the gold value of the note issue having
been raised to nearly two and a half times the low point reached in
September 1922. The fact of stabilisation, with foreign aid, has,
by increasing confidence, permitted this increase of the note issue
without imperilling the stabilisation, and will probably permit in
course of time a substantial further increase.

Even in Russia a sort of equilibrium seems to have been reached. There
the last phase had appeared by the middle of 1922, when a tenfold
inflation in six months[13] had brought the aggregate value of the
note issue below £4,000,000, which clearly could not be adequate
for the transaction of the business of Russia even in its present
condition. A point had been reached when the use of paper roubles
was being dispensed with altogether. At about that date I had the
opportunity of discussion at Genoa with some of the Soviet financiers.
They have always been more self-conscious and deliberate than others
in their monetary policy. They maintained at that time that, with the
help of legal compulsion to employ paper roubles for certain types of
transaction, these roubles could always be maintained in circulation
up to a certain _minimum_ real value, however certain the public might
be as to their ultimate worthlessness. According to this calculation,
it would always be possible to raise (say) £3,000,000 to £4,000,000
per annum by this method, even though the paper rouble regularly fell
in value at the rate of a tenfold or a hundredfold a year (one or more
noughts being struck off the monetary unit annually for convenience of
calculation). During the year following they did, in fact, decidedly
better than this, and, by reducing the rate of inflation to a figure
not much in excess of 100 per cent per three months, were able to raise
the aggregate value of the note issue to more than double the lowest
point reached. The equivalent of something like £15,000,000 seems to
have been raised during the year (April 1922–April 1923) by this means
towards the expenses of government, at the cost of having to strike
only one nought off the monetary unit for the whole year![14] At the
same time, in order to furnish a reliable store of value and a basis
for foreign trade, the Soviet Government introduced in December 1922 a
new currency unit (the chervonetz, or gold ducat), freely convertible
on sterling-exchange standard principles, alongside the paper rouble,
which was still indispensable as an instrument of taxation. So far this
new bank note has kept respectable. By August 1923 its circulation had
risen to nearly 16,000,000 having a value of about £16,000,000, and its
exchange value had kept steady, the State Bank undertaking to convert
the chervonetz on a parity with the £ sterling.[15] Thus by the middle
of 1923 the aggregate value of the Russian note issues, good and bad
money together, had risen to the substantial figure of £25,000,000, as
compared with barely £4,000,000 at the date of the Genoa Conference
in May 1922, thus indicating the return of confidence and the
re-inauguration of a monetary _régime_. Russia provides an instructive
example (at least for the moment) of a sound money for substantial
transactions alongside small change for daily life, the progressive
depreciation on which merely represents a quite supportable rate of
turn-over tax.

       [13] Recent experience everywhere seems to show that it is
            possible to inflate 100 per cent every three months without
            entirely killing the use of money in retail transactions,
            but that a greater rate of inflation than this can only be
            indulged in at the peril of total collapse.

       [14] The Soviet Government have always regarded monetary
            inflation quite frankly as an instrument of taxation,
            and have themselves calculated that the purchasing power
            secured to the State by this means has amounted in the past
            to the following sums:

              1918                      525 million gold roubles
              1919                      380    „     „      „
              1920                      186    „     „      „
              1921                      143    „     „      „
              1922 (Jan. to March)       58    „     „      „
                      or (say) £130,000,000 altogether.


       [15] So far the chervonetz has generally sold at a small
            premium, the rates being:

              March 15, 1923      ch. 1 = £1·07
              April 17, 1923      ch. 1 = £1·05
              June 15, 1923       ch. 1 = £0·94
              July 27, 1923       ch. 1 = £1·05


The collapse of the currency in Germany which was the chief
contributory cause to the fall of Dr. Cuno’s Government in August 1923,
was due, not so much to taxing by inflation--for that had been going
on for years--as to an increase in the _rate_ of inflation to a level
almost prohibitive for daily transactions and quite destructive of
the legal-tender money as a unit of account. We have seen that what
concerns the use of money in the retail transactions of daily life
is the _rate_ of depreciation, rather than the absolute amount of
depreciation as compared with some earlier date.

In the middle of 1922 I estimated, very roughly, that the German
Government had then been obtaining for some time past the equivalent of
something between £75,000,000 and £100,000,000 per annum by means of
printing money. Up to that time, however, a substantial proportion of
these receipts had been contributed through the purchase of mark-notes
by speculative foreigners. Nevertheless the German public itself
had probably paid upwards of £50,000,000 per annum in this form of
taxation. Since the German note issue was still worth £240,000,000 so
lately as December 1920 (see the table on p. 51) and had not fallen
below £100,000,000 even in the middle of 1922, the rate of depreciation
represented by the above, whilst sufficiently disastrous to the mark
as a store of value or as a unit of account, had been by no means
prohibitive to its continued use in daily life. In the latter half of
1922, however, the public learnt to make enough further economies in
the use of the mark as money to reduce the value of the total note
issue to about £60,000,000. The first effect of the Ruhr occupation
was, as we have seen above (p. 54), to bring down the note issue below
the minimum to which the public could adjust their habits, which
resulted in the temporary recovery of March 1923. Nevertheless by the
middle of 1923 the public was able to get along with a note issue worth
about £20,000,000. All this time the German Government had continued
to raise resources equivalent to round about £1,000,000 a week by
note-printing--which meant a depreciation of 5 per cent a week even
if the public had been unable to reduce any further the value of the
aggregate note issue, and came in practice to about 10 per cent a week
allowing for their yet further economies in the use of mark-currency.

But the expenses of the Ruhr resistance, coupled with the complete
breakdown of other sources of taxation, had led, by May and June 1923,
to the Government’s raising the equivalent of, first, £2,000,000
and then £3,000,000 a week by note-printing. On a note issue, of
which the total value had sunk by that time to about £20,000,000,
this was pushing inflationary taxation to a preposterous and suicidal
point. The social disorganisation, resulting from a rapid movement
to do without the mark altogether, quickly resulted in Dr. Cuno’s
fall.[16] The climax was reached when, in Dr. Cuno’s last days, the
Government doubled the note issue in a week and raised the equivalent
of £3,000,000 in that period out of a note issue worth about £4,000,000
altogether,--a performance far transcending the wildest extravagances
of the Soviet.

       [16] It is necessary to admit that Dr. Cuno’s failure to control
            incompetence at the Treasury and at the Reichsbank was
            bound to bring this about. During this catastrophic period
            those responsible for the financial policy of Germany did
            not do a single wise thing, or show the least appreciation
            of what was happening. The profits of note-printing were
            not even monopolised by the Government, and Herr Havenstein
            continued to allow the German banks to share in them, by
            discounting their bills at the Reichsbank at a rate of
            discount far below the rate of depreciation. Only at the
            end of August 1923 did the Reichsbank begin to require that
            borrowers should make good on repayment a percentage of
            the loss due to the depreciation of the borrowed marks (as
            reckoned by the dollar exchange) during the currency of the
            loan.

By the time this book is published, Dr. Cuno’s successors may have
solved, or failed to solve, the problem facing them. However this may
be, the restoration of a serviceable unit of account seems to be the
first step. This is a necessary preliminary to the escape of the German
financial system from the vicious circle in which it now moves. The
Government cannot introduce a sound money, because, in the absence
of other revenue, the printing of an unsound money is the only way by
which it can live. Yet a serviceable unit of account is a pre-requisite
of the collection of the normal sources of revenue. The best course,
therefore, is to remain content for a little longer with an unsound
money as a source of revenue, but to introduce immediately a steady
unit of account (the relation of which to the unsound money could be
officially fixed daily or weekly) as a preliminary to the restoration
of the normal sources of revenue.

The recent history of German finance can be summarised thus. Reliance
on inflationary taxation, whilst extremely productive to the exchequer
in its earliest stages especially whilst the foreign speculator
was still buying paper marks, gradually broke down the mark as a
serviceable unit of account, one of the effects of which was to render
unproductive the greater part of the rest of the revenue-collecting
machinery--most taxes being necessarily assessed at some interval of
time before they are collected. The failure of the rest of the revenue
rendered the Treasury more and more dependent on inflation, until
finally the use of legal-tender money had been so far abandoned by the
public that even the inflationary tax ceased to be productive and the
Government was threatened by literal bankruptcy. At this stage, the
fiscal organisation of the country had been so thoroughly destroyed
and its social and economic organisation so grievously disordered, as
in Russia eighteen months earlier, that it was a perplexing problem to
devise ways and means by which the Government could live during the
transitional period whilst the normal machinery for collecting revenue
was being re-created, especially in face of the struggle with France
proceeding at the same time. Nevertheless the problem is not insoluble;
many suggestions could be made; and a way out will doubtless be found
at length.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is common to speak as though, when a Government pays its way by
inflation, the people of the country avoid taxation. We have seen that
this is not so. What is raised by printing notes is just as much taken
from the public as is a beer-duty or an income-tax. What a Government
spends the public pay for. There is no such thing as an uncovered
deficit. But in some countries it seems possible to please and content
the public, for a time at least, by giving them, in return for the
taxes they pay, finely engraved acknowledgements on water-marked
paper. The income-tax receipts, which we in England receive from the
Surveyor, we throw into the wastepaper basket; in Germany they call
them bank-notes and put them into their pocket-books; in France they
are termed Rentes and are locked up in the family safe.


II. _Currency Depreciation_ versus _Capital Levy_

We have seen in the preceding section the extent to which a Government
can make use of currency inflation for the purpose of securing income
to meet its outgoings. But there is a second way in which inflation
helps a Government to make both ends meet, namely by reducing the
burden of its pre-existing liabilities in so far as they have been
fixed in terms of money. These liabilities consist, in the main, of the
internal debt. Every step of depreciation obviously means a reduction
in the real claims of the _rentes_-holders against their Government.

It would be too cynical to suppose that, in order to secure the
advantages discussed in this section, Governments (except, possibly,
the Russian Government) depreciate their currencies _on purpose_.
As a rule, they are, or consider themselves to be, driven to it
by their necessities. The requirements of the Treasury to meet
sudden exceptional outgoings--for a war or to pay the consequences
of defeat--are likely to be the original occasion of, at least
_temporary_, inflation. But the most cogent reason for _permanent_
depreciation, that is to say _Devaluation_, or the policy of fixing
the value of the currency permanently at the low level to which a
temporary emergency has driven it, is generally to be found in the fact
that a restoration of the currency to its former value would raise the
recurrent annual burden of the fixed charges of the National Debt to
an insupportable level.

There is, nevertheless, an alternative to Devaluation in such cases,
provided the opponents of Devaluation are prepared to face it in time,
which they generally are not,--namely a Capital Levy. The purpose of
this section is to bring out clearly the _alternative_ character of
these two methods of moderating the claims of the _rentier_, when the
State’s contractual liabilities, fixed in terms of money, have reached
an excessive proportion of the national income.

The active and working elements in no community, ancient or modern,
will consent to hand over to the _rentier_ or bond-holding class
more than a certain proportion of the fruits of their work. When the
piled-up debt demands more than a tolerable proportion, relief has
usually been sought in one or other of two out of the three possible
methods. The first is Repudiation. But, except as the accompaniment of
Revolution, this method is too crude, too deliberate, and too obvious
in its incidence. The victims are immediately aware and cry out too
loud; so that, in the absence of Revolution, this solution may be ruled
out at present, as regards _internal_ debt, in Western Europe.

The second method is Currency Depreciation, which becomes Devaluation
when it is fixed and confirmed by law. In the countries of Europe
lately belligerent, this expedient has been adopted already on a
scale which reduces the real burden of the debt by from 50 to 100 per
cent. In Germany the National Debt has been by these means practically
obliterated, and the bond-holders have lost everything. In France
the real burden of the debt is less than a third of what it would be
if the franc stood at par; and in Italy only a quarter. The owners
of small savings suffer quietly, as experience shows, these enormous
depredations, when they would have thrown down a Government which had
taken from them a fraction of the amount by more deliberate but juster
instruments.

This fact, however, can scarcely justify such an expedient on its
merits. Its indirect evils are many. Instead of dividing the burden
between all classes of wealth-owners according to a graduated scale,
it throws the whole burden on to the owners of fixed interest bearing
stocks, lets off the _entrepreneur_ capitalist and even enriches him,
and hits small savings equally with great fortunes. It follows the
line of least resistance, and responsibility cannot be brought home
to individuals. It is, so to speak, nature’s remedy, which comes into
silent operation when the body politic has shrunk from curing itself.

The remaining, the scientific, expedient, the Capital Levy, has never
yet been tried on a large scale; and perhaps it never will be. It is
the rational, the deliberate method. But it is difficult to explain,
and it provokes violent prejudice by coming into conflict with the
deep instincts by which the love of money protects itself. Unless the
patient understands and approves its purpose, he will not submit to so
severe a surgical operation.

Once Currency Depreciation has done its work, I should not advocate
the unwise, and probably impracticable, policy of retracing the path
with the aid of a Capital Levy. But if it has become clear that the
claims of the bond-holder are more than the taxpayer can support, and
if there is still time to choose between the policies of a Levy and
of further Depreciation, the Levy must surely be preferred on grounds
both of expediency and of justice. It is an overwhelming objection
to the method of Currency Depreciation, as compared with that of the
Levy, that it falls entirely upon persons whose wealth is in the form
of claims to legal-tender money, and that these are generally, amongst
the capitalists, the poorer capitalists. It is entirely ungraduated; it
falls on small savings just as hardly as on big ones; and incidentally
it benefits the capitalist _entrepreneur_ class for the reasons
explained in Chapter I. Unfortunately the small savers who have most to
lose by Currency Depreciation are precisely the sort of conservative
people who are most alarmed by a Capital Levy; whilst, on the other
hand, the _entrepreneur_ class must obviously prefer Depreciation which
does not hit them very much and may actually enrich them. It is the
combination of these two forces which will generally bring it about
that a country will prefer the inequitable and disastrous courses of
Currency Depreciation to the scientific deliberation of a Levy.

There is a respectable and influential body of opinion which,
repudiating with vehemence the adoption of either expedient, fulminates
alike against Devaluations and Levies, on the ground that they infringe
the untouchable sacredness of contract; or rather of vested interest,
for an alteration of the legal tender and the imposition of a tax on
property are neither of them in the least illegal or even contrary to
precedent. Yet such persons, by overlooking one of the greatest of
all social principles, namely the fundamental distinction between the
right of the individual to repudiate contract and the right of the
State to control vested interest, are the worst enemies of what they
seek to preserve. For nothing can preserve the integrity of contract
between individuals, except a discretionary authority in the State
to revise what has become intolerable. The powers of uninterrupted
usury are too great. If the accretions of vested interest were to grow
without mitigation for many generations, half the population would be
no better than slaves to the other half. Nor can the fact that in time
of war it is easier for the State to borrow than to tax, be allowed
permanently to enslave the taxpayer to the bond-holder. Those who
insist that in these matters the State is in exactly the same position
as the individual, will, if they have their way, render impossible
the continuance of an individualist society, which depends for its
existence on moderation.

These conclusions might be deemed obvious if experience did not show
that many conservative bankers regard it as more consonant with their
cloth, and also as economising thought, to shift public discussion of
financial topics off the logical on to an alleged “moral” plane, which
means a realm of thought where vested interest can be triumphant over
the common good without further debate. But it makes them untrustworthy
guides in a perilous age of transition. The State must never neglect
the importance of so acting in ordinary matters as to promote certainty
and security in business. But when great decisions are to be made,
the State is a sovereign body of which the purpose is to promote the
greatest good of the whole. When, therefore, we enter the realm of
State action, _everything_ is to be considered and weighed on its
merits. Changes in Death Duties, Income Tax, Land Tenure, Licensing,
Game Laws, Church Establishment, Feudal Rights, Slavery, and so on
through all ages, have received the same denunciations from the
absolutists of contract,--who are the real parents of Revolution.

In our own country the question of the Capital Levy depends for its
answer on whether the great increase in the claims of the bond-holder,
arising out of the fact that it was easier, and perhaps more expedient,
to raise a large part of the current costs of the war by loans rather
than by taxes, is more than the taxpayer can be required, in the
long run, to support. The high levels of the Death Duties and of the
income- and super-taxes on unearned income, by which the net return
to the bond-holder is substantially diminished,[17] modify the case.
Nevertheless, immediately after the war, when it seemed that the normal
budget could scarcely be balanced without a level of taxation of which
a tax on earned income at a standard rate between 6s. and 10s. in the
£ would be typical, a levy seemed to be necessary. At the present
time the case is rather more doubtful. It is not yet possible to know
how the normal budget will work out, and much depends on the level at
which sterling prices are stabilised. If the level of sterling prices
is materially lowered, whether in pursuance of a policy of restoring
the old gold parity or for any other reason, a levy may be required.
If, however, sterling prices are stabilised somewhere between 80 and
100 per cent above the pre-war level--a settlement probably desirable
on other grounds--and if the progressive prosperity of the country
is restored, then perhaps we may balance our future budgets without
oppressive taxation on earned income and without a levy either. A levy
is from the practical view perfectly feasible, and is not open to more
objection than any other _new_ tax of like magnitude. Nevertheless,
like all new taxes, it cannot be brought in without friction, and
is, therefore, scarcely worth advocating for its own sake merely
in substitution for an existing tax of similar incidence. It is to
be regarded as the fairest and most expedient method of adjusting
the burden of taxation between past accumulations and the fruits of
present efforts, whenever, in the general judgment of the country, the
discouragement to the latter is excessive. A levy is to be judged, not
by itself, but as against the practicable alternatives. Experience
shows with great certainty that the active part of the community will
not submit in the long run to pay too much to vested interest, and, if
the necessary adjustment is not made in one way, it will be made in
another,--probably by the depreciation of the currency.

       [17] The net return to the French _rentier_ is more than 6 per
            cent; to the British not much above 3 per cent.

In several countries the existing burden of the internal debt
renders Devaluation inevitable and certain sooner or later. It will
be sufficient to illustrate the case by reference to the situation
of France,--the home of absolutism of all kinds, and hence, sooner
or later, of _bouleversement_. The finances of Humpty Dumpty are as
follows:

At the end of 1922 the internal debt of France, excluding altogether
her external debt, exceeded 250 milliard francs. Further borrowing
budgeted for in the ensuing period, together with loans on
reconstruction account guaranteed by the Government, may bring this
total to the neighbourhood of 300 milliards by the end of 1923. The
service of this debt will absorb nearly 18 milliards per annum. The
total normal receipts under the provisional[18] Budget for 1923 are
estimated at round 23 milliards. That is to say, the service of the
debt will shortly absorb, at the value of the franc current early in
1923, almost the entire yield of taxation. Since other Government
expenditure in the ordinary budget (_i.e._, excluding war pensions and
future expenditure on reconstruction) cannot be put below 12 milliards
a year, it follows that, even on the improbable hypothesis that further
expenditure in the extraordinary budget after 1923 will be paid for by
Germany, the yield of taxation must be increased permanently by 30 per
cent to make both ends meet. If, however, the franc were to depreciate
to (say) 100 to the pound sterling, the ordinary budget could be
balanced by taking little more of the real income of the country than
in 1922.

       [18] The forecasts of the final outcome of the year are
            frequently changed and may be somewhat different from the
            above,--though not sufficiently to affect the argument.
            M. de Lasteyrie has lately pointed out with pride how
            the further depreciation of the franc, since he first
            introduced his budget, is already improving the receipts
            measured in terms of francs.

In these circumstances it will be difficult, if not impossible, to
avoid the subtle assistance of a further depreciation. What, then,
is to be said of those who still discuss seriously the project of
restoring the franc to its former parity? In such an event the already
intolerable burden of the _rentier’s_ claims would be about trebled.
It is unthinkable that the French taxpayer would submit. Even if the
franc were put back to par by a miracle, it could not stay there. Fresh
inflation due to the inadequacy of tax receipts must drive it anew on
its downward course. Yet I have assumed the cancellation of the whole
of France’s external debt, and the assumption by Germany of the burdens
of the extraordinary budget after 1923, an assumption which is not
justified by present expectations. These facts alone render it certain
that the franc cannot be restored to its former value.

France must come in due course to some compromise between increasing
taxation, and diminishing expenditure, and reducing what they owe their
_rentiers_. I have not much doubt that the French public, as they have
hitherto, will consider a further dose of depreciation--attributing it
to the “bad will” of Germany or to financial Machiavellism in London
and New York--as far more conservative, orthodox, and in the interest
of small savers, than a justly constructed Capital Levy, the odium of
which could be less easily escaped by the French Ministry of Finance.

If we look ahead, averting our eyes from the ups and downs which can
make and unmake fortunes in the meantime, the level of the franc
is going to be settled in the long run not by speculation or the
balance of trade, or even the outcome of the Ruhr adventure, but by
the proportion of his earned income which the French taxpayer will
permit to be taken from him to pay the claims of the French _rentier_.
The level of the franc exchange will continue to fall until the
commodity-value of the francs due to the _rentier_ has fallen to a
proportion of the national income, which accords with the habits and
mentality of the country.




CHAPTER III

THE THEORY OF MONEY AND OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGES


The evil consequences of instability in the standard of value have
now been sufficiently described. In this chapter[19] we must lay
the theoretical foundations for the practical suggestions of the
concluding chapters. Most academic treatises on monetary theory have
been based, until lately, on so firm a presumption of a gold standard
régime that they need to be adapted to the existing régime of mutually
inconvertible paper standards.

       [19] Parts of this chapter raise, unavoidably, matters of much
            greater difficulty to the layman than the rest of the book.
            The reader whose interest in the theoretical foundations is
            secondary can pass on.


I. _The Quantity Theory of Money_

This Theory is fundamental. Its correspondence with fact is not open to
question.[20] Nevertheless it is often misstated and misrepresented.
Goschen’s saying of sixty years ago, that “there are many persons
who cannot hear the relation of the level of prices to the volume of
currency affirmed without a feeling akin to irritation,” still holds
good.

       [20] “The Quantity Theory is often defended and opposed as
            though it were a definite set of propositions that must
            be either true or false. But in fact the formulæ employed
            in the exposition of that theory are merely devices for
            enabling us to bring together in an orderly way the
            principal causes by which the value of money is determined”
            (Pigou).

The Theory flows from the fact that money as such has no utility except
what is derived from its exchange-value, that is to say from the
utility of the things which it can buy. Valuable articles other than
money have a utility in themselves. Provided that they are divisible
and transferable, the total amount of this utility increases with their
quantity;--it will not increase in full proportion to the quantity,
but, up to the point of satiety, it does increase.

If an article is used for money, such as gold, which has a utility
in itself for other purposes, aside from its use as money, the
strict statement of the theory, though fundamentally unchanged, is a
little complicated. In present circumstances we can excuse ourselves
this complication. A Currency Note has no utility in itself and is
completely worthless except for the purchasing power which it has as
money.

Consequently what the public want is not so many ounces or so many
square yards or even so many £ sterling of currency notes, but a
quantity sufficient to cover a week’s wages, or to pay their bills,
or to meet their probable outgoings on a journey or a day’s shopping.
When people find themselves with more cash than they require for
such purposes, they get rid of the surplus by buying goods or
investments, or by leaving it for a bank to employ, or, possibly, by
increasing their hoarded reserves. Thus the _number_ of notes which
the public ordinarily have on hand is determined by the amount of
_purchasing power_ which it suits them to hold or to carry about,
and by nothing else. The amount of this purchasing power depends
partly on their wealth, partly on their habits. The wealth of the
public in the aggregate will only change gradually. Their habits
in the use of money--whether their income is paid them weekly or
monthly or quarterly, whether they pay cash at shops or run accounts,
whether they deposit with banks, whether they cash small cheques at
short intervals or larger cheques at longer intervals, whether they
keep a reserve or hoard of money about the house--are more easily
altered. But if their wealth and their habits in the above respects
are unchanged, then the amount of purchasing power which they hold in
the form of money is definitely fixed. We can measure this definite
amount of purchasing power in terms of a unit made up of a collection
of specified quantities of their standard articles of consumption or
other objects of expenditure; for example, the kinds and quantities of
articles which are combined for the purpose of a cost-of-living index
number. Let us call such a unit a “consumption unit” and assume that
the public require to hold an amount of money having a purchasing power
over _k_ consumption units. Let there be _n_ currency notes or other
forms of cash in circulation with the public, and let _p_ be the price
of each consumption unit (_i.e._ _p_ is the index number of the cost
of living), then it follows from the above that _n = pk_. This is the
famous Quantity Theory of Money. So long as _k_ remains unchanged, _n_
and _p_ rise and fall together; that is to say, the greater or the
fewer the number of currency notes, the higher or the lower is the
price level in the same proportion.

So far we have assumed that the whole of the public requirement for
purchasing power is satisfied by cash, and on the other hand that this
requirement is the only source of demand for cash; neglecting the fact
that the public, including the business world, employ for the same
purpose bank deposits and overdraft facilities, whilst the banks must
for the same reason maintain a reserve of cash. The theory is easily
extended, however, to cover this case. Let us assume that the public,
including the business world, find it convenient to keep the equivalent
of _k_ consumption units in cash and of a further _k´_ available
at their banks against cheques, and that the banks keep in cash a
proportion _r_ of their potential liabilities (_k´_) to the public. Our
equation then becomes

    _n = p(k + rk´)_.

So long as _k_, _k´_, and _r_ remain unchanged, we have the same
result as before, namely, that _n_ and _p_ rise and fall together. The
proportion between _k_ and _k´_ depends on the banking arrangements of
the public; the absolute value of these on their habits generally; and
the value of _r_ on the reserve practices of the banks. Thus, so long
as these are unaltered, we still have a direct relation between the
_quantity_ of cash (_n_) and the level of prices (_p_).[21]

       [21] My exposition follows the general lines of Prof. Pigou
            (_Quarterly Journal of Economics_, Nov. 1917) and of Dr.
            Marshall (_Money, Credit, and Commerce_, I. iv.), rather
            than the perhaps more familiar analysis of Prof. Irving
            Fisher. Instead of starting with the amount of cash held by
            the public, Prof. Fisher begins with the volume of business
            transacted by means of money and the frequency with which
            each unit of money changes hands. It comes to the same
            thing in the end and it is easy to pass from the above
            formula to Prof. Fisher’s; but the above method of approach
            seems less artificial than Prof. Fisher’s and nearer to the
            observed facts.

We have seen that the amount of _k_ and _k´_ depends partly on the
wealth of the community, partly on its habits. Its habits are fixed by
its estimation of the extra convenience of having more cash in hand
as compared with the advantages to be got from spending the cash or
investing it. The point of equilibrium is reached where the estimated
advantages of keeping more cash in hand compared with those of spending
or investing it about balance. The matter cannot be summed up better
than in the words of Dr. Marshall:

    “In every state of society there is some fraction of their income
    which people find it worth while to keep in the form of currency;
    it may be a fifth, or a tenth, or a twentieth. A large command of
    resources in the form of currency renders their business easy and
    smooth, and puts them at an advantage in bargaining; but on the
    other hand it locks up in a barren form resources that might yield
    an income of gratification if invested, say, in extra furniture; or
    a money income, if invested in extra machinery or cattle.” A man
    fixes the appropriate fraction “after balancing one against another
    the advantages of a further ready command, and the disadvantages
    of putting more of his resources into a form in which they yield
    him no direct income or other benefit.” “Let us suppose that the
    inhabitants of a country, taken one with another (and including
    therefore all varieties of character and of occupation), find
    it just worth their while to keep by them on the average ready
    purchasing power to the extent of a tenth part of their annual
    income, together with a fiftieth part of their property; then the
    aggregate value of the currency of the country will tend to be
    equal to the sum of these amounts.”[22]

       [22] _Money, Credit, and Commerce_, I. iv. 3. Dr. Marshall
            shows in a footnote as follows that the above is in fact
            a development of the traditional way of considering the
            matter: “Petty thought that the money ‘sufficient for’
            the nation is ‘so much as will pay half a year’s rent
            for all the lands of England and a quarter’s rent of the
            Houseing, for a week’s expense of all the people, and about
            a quarter of the value of all the exported commodities.’
            Locke estimated that ‘one-fiftieth of wages and one-fourth
            of the landowner’s income and one-twentieth part of the
            broker’s yearly returns in ready money will be enough to
            drive the trade of any country.’ Cantillon (A.D. 1755),
            after a long and subtle study, concludes that the value
            needed is a ninth of the total produce of the country; or,
            what he takes to be the same thing, a third of the rent
            of the land. Adam Smith has more of the scepticism of the
            modern age and says: ‘it is impossible to determine the
            proportion,’ though ‘it has been computed by different
            authors at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a
            thirtieth part of the whole value of the annual produce.’”
            In modern conditions the normal proportion of the
            circulation to this national income seems to be somewhere
            between a tenth and a fifteenth.

So far there should be no room for difference of opinion. The error
often made by careless adherents of the Quantity Theory, which may
partly explain why it is not universally accepted, is as follows.

Every one admits that the habits of the public in the use of money
and of banking facilities and the practices of the banks in respect
of their reserves change from time to time as the result of obvious
developments. These habits and practices are a reflection of changes
in economic and social organisation. But the Theory has often been
expounded on the further assumption that a _mere_ change in the
quantity of the currency cannot affect _k_, _r_, and _k´_,--that is to
say, in mathematical parlance, that _n_ is an _independent variable_
in relation to these quantities. It would follow from this that an
arbitrary doubling of _n_, since this in itself is assumed not to
affect _k_, _r_, and _k´_, must have the effect of raising _p_ to
double what it would have been otherwise. The Quantity Theory is often
stated in this, or a similar, form.

Now “in the long run” this is probably true. If, after the American
Civil War, the American dollar had been stabilised and defined by law
at 10 per cent below its present value, it would be safe to assume that
_n_ and _p_ would now be just 10 per cent greater than they actually
are and that the present values of _k_, _r_, and _k´_ would be entirely
unaffected. But this _long run_ is a misleading guide to current
affairs. _In the long run_ we are all dead. Economists set themselves
too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only
tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.

In actual experience, a change of n is liable to have a reaction both
on _k_ and _k´_ and on _r_. It will be enough to give a few typical
instances. Before the war (and indeed since) there was a considerable
element of what was conventional and arbitrary in the reserve policy
of the banks, but especially in the policy of the State Banks towards
their gold reserves. These reserves were kept for show rather than for
use, and their amount was not the result of close reasoning. There
was a decided tendency on the part of these banks between 1900 and
1914 to bottle up gold when it flowed towards them and to part with
it reluctantly when the tide was flowing the other way. Consequently,
when gold became relatively abundant they tended to hoard what came
their way and to raise the proportion of the reserves, with the result
that the increased output of South African gold was absorbed with less
effect on the price level than would have been the case if an increase
of _n_ had been totally without reaction on the value of _r_.

In agricultural countries where peasants readily hoard money, an
inflation, especially in its early stages, does not raise prices
proportionately, because when, as a result of a certain rise in the
price of agricultural products, more money flows into the pockets of
the peasants, it tends to stick there;--deeming themselves that much
richer, the peasants increase the proportion of their receipts that
they hoard.

Thus in these and in other ways the terms of our equation tend in
their movements to favour the stability of _p_, and there is a certain
friction which prevents a moderate change in _n_ from exercising its
full proportionate effect on _p_.

On the other hand a large change in _n_, which rubs away the initial
friction, and especially a change in _n_ due to causes which set up
a general expectation of a further change in the same direction, may
produce a _more_ than proportionate effect on _p_. After the general
analysis of Chapter I. and the narratives of catastrophic inflations
given in Chapter II., it is scarcely necessary to illustrate this
further,--it is a matter more readily understood than it was ten years
ago. A large change in _p_ greatly affects individual fortunes. Hence a
change after it has occurred, or sooner in so far as it is anticipated,
may greatly affect the monetary habits of the public in their attempt
to protect themselves from a similar loss in future, or to make gains
and avoid loss during the passage from the equilibrium corresponding to
the old value of _n_ to the equilibrium corresponding to its new value.
Thus after, during, and (so far as the change is anticipated) before a
change in the value of _n_, there will be some reaction on the values
of _k_, _k´_, and _r_, with the result that the change in the value of
_p_, at least temporarily and perhaps permanently (since habits and
practices, once changed, will not revert to exactly their old shape),
will not be precisely in proportion to the change in _n_.

The terms _inflation_ and _deflation_ are used by different writers
in varying senses. It would be convenient to speak of an increase
or decrease in _n_ as an inflation or deflation of _cash_; and of a
decrease or increase in _r_ as an inflation or deflation of _credit_.
The characteristic of the “credit-cycle” (as the alternation of boom
and depression is now described) consists in a tendency of _k_ and
_k´_ to diminish during the boom and increase during the depression,
irrespective of changes in _n_ and _r_, these movements representing
respectively a diminution and an increase of “real” balances (_i.e._
balances, in hand or at the bank, measured in terms of purchasing
power); so that we might call this phenomenon deflation and inflation
of real balances.

It will illustrate the “Quantity Theory” equation in general and the
phenomena of deflation and inflation of real balances in particular,
if we endeavour to fill in actual values for our symbolic quantities.
The following example does not claim to be exact and its object is to
illustrate the idea rather than to convey statistically precise facts.
October 1920 was about the end of the recent boom, and October 1922
was near the bottom of the depression. At these two dates the figures
of price level (taking October 1922 as 100), cash circulation (note
circulation _plus_ private deposits at the Bank of England[23]), and
bank deposits in Great Britain were roughly as follows:

       [23] It would take me too far from the immediate matter in hand
            to discuss why I take this definition of “cash” in the case
            of Great Britain. It is discussed further in Chapter V.
            below.

                Price Level.  Cash Circulation.   Bank Deposits.
  October 1920      150        £585,000,000       £2,000,000,000
  October 1922      100        £504,000,000       £1,700,000,000

The value of _r_ was not very different at the two dates--say about
12 per cent. Consequently our equation for the two dates works out as
follows[24]:

  October 1920  _n_ = 585  _p_ = 1·5  _k_ = 230  _k´_ = 1333
  October 1922  _n_ = 504  _p_ = 1    _k_ = 300  _k´_ = 1700

       [24] For 585 = 1·5(230 + 1333 × ·12), and 504 = 1(300 + 1700 ×
            ·12).

Thus during the depression _k_ rose from 230 to 300 and _k´_ from 1333
to 1700, which means that the cash holdings of the public at the former
date were worth 23/30, and their bank balances 1333/1700, what they
were worth at the latter date. It thus appears that the tendency of
_k_ and _k´_ to increase had more to do, than the deflation of “cash”
had, with the fall of prices between the two periods. If _k_ and _k´_
were to fall back to their 1920 values, prices would rise 30 per cent
without any change whatever in the volume of cash or the reserve policy
of the banks. Thus even in Great Britain the fluctuations of _k_ and
_k´_ can have a decisive influence on the price level; whilst we have
already seen (pp. 51, 52) how enormously they can change in the recent
conditions of Russia and Central Europe.

The moral of this discussion, to be carried forward in the reader’s
mind until we reach Chapters IV. and V., is that the price level is not
mysterious, but is governed by a few, definite, analysable influences.
Two of these, _n_ and _r_, are under the direct control (or ought to
be) of the central banking authorities. The third, namely _k_ and _k´_,
is not directly controllable, and depends on the mood of the public and
the business world. The business of stabilising the price level, not
merely over long periods but so as also to avoid cyclical fluctuations,
consists partly in exercising a stabilising influence over _k_ and
_k´_, in so far as this fails or is impracticable, in deliberately
varying _n_ and _r_ so as to _counterbalance_ the movement of _k_ and
_k´_.

The usual method of exercising a stabilising influence over _k_ and
_k´_ especially over _k´_, is that of bank-rate. A tendency of _k´_
to increase may be somewhat counteracted by lowering the bank-rate,
because easy lending diminishes the advantage of keeping a margin for
contingencies in cash. Cheap money also operates to _counterbalance_
an increase of _k´_, because, by encouraging borrowing from the banks,
it prevents _r_ from increasing or causes _r_ to diminish. But it
is doubtful whether bank-rate by itself is always a powerful enough
instrument, and, if we are to achieve stability, we must be prepared to
vary _n_ and _r_ on occasion.

Our analysis suggests that the first duty of the central banking
and currency authorities is to make sure that they have _n_ and _r_
thoroughly under control. For example, so long as inflationary taxation
is in question _n_ will be influenced by other than currency objects
and cannot, therefore, be fully under control; moreover, at the other
extreme, under a gold standard _n_ is not always under control, because
it depends on the unregulated forces which determine the demand and
supply of gold throughout the world. Again, without a central banking
system _r_ will not be under proper control because it will be
determined by the unco-ordinated decisions of numerous different banks.

At the present time in Great Britain _r_ is very completely controlled,
and _n_ also, so long as we refrain from inflationary finance on the
one hand and from a return to an unregulated gold standard on the
other.[25] The second duty of the authorities is therefore worth
discussing, namely, the _use_ of their control over _n_ and _r_ to
counterbalance changes in _k_ and _k´_. Even if _k_ and _k´_ were
entirely outside the influence of deliberate policy, which is not in
fact the case, nevertheless _p_ could be kept reasonably steady by
suitable modifications of the values of _n_ and _r_.

       [25] In the case of the United States the same thing is more or
            less true, so long as the Federal Reserve Board is prepared
            to incur the expense of bottling up redundant gold.

Old-fashioned advocates of sound money have laid too much emphasis
on the need of keeping _n_ and _r_ steady, and have argued as if
this policy by itself would produce the right results. So far from
this being so, steadiness of _n_ and _r_, when _k_ and _k´_ are not
steady, is bound to lead to unsteadiness of the price level. Cyclical
fluctuations are characterised, not primarily by changes in _n_ or _r_,
but by changes in _k_ and _k´_. It follows that they can only be cured
if we are ready deliberately to increase and decrease _n_ and _r_, when
symptoms of movement are showing in the values of _k_ and _k´_. I am
being led, however, into a large subject beyond my immediate purpose,
and am anticipating also the topic of Chapter V. These hints will
serve, nevertheless, to indicate to the reader what a long way we may
be led by an understanding of the implications of the simple Quantity
equation with which we started.


II. _The Theory of Purchasing Power Parity._

The Quantity Theory deals with the purchasing power or commodity-value
of a given national currency. We come now to the _relative_ value of
_two_ distinct national currencies,--that is to say, to the theory of
the Foreign Exchanges.

When the currencies of the world were nearly all on a gold basis, their
relative value (_i.e._ the exchanges) depended on the actual amount of
gold metal in a unit of each, with minor adjustments for the cost of
transferring the metal from place to place.

When this common measure has ceased to be effective and we have instead
a number of independent systems of inconvertible paper, what basic
fact determines the rates at which units of the different currencies
exchange for one another?

The explanation is to be found in the doctrine, as old in itself as
Ricardo, with which Professor Cassel has lately familiarised the public
under the name of “Purchasing Power Parity.”[26]

       [26] This term was first introduced into economic literature in
            an article contributed by Prof. Cassel to the _Economic
            Journal_, December 1918. For Prof. Cassel’s considered
            opinions on the whole question, see his _Money and Foreign
            Exchange after 1914_ (1922). The theory, as distinct from
            the name, is essentially Ricardo’s.

This doctrine in its baldest form runs as follows: (1) The purchasing
power of an inconvertible currency within its own country, _i.e._ the
currency’s _internal_ purchasing power, depends on the currency policy
of the Government and the currency habits of the people, in accordance
with the Quantity Theory of Money just discussed. (2) The purchasing
power of an inconvertible currency in a foreign country, _i.e._ the
currency’s _external_ purchasing power, must be the rate of exchange
between the home-currency and the foreign-currency, multiplied by
the foreign-currency’s purchasing power in its own country. (3) In
conditions of equilibrium the _internal_ and _external_ purchasing
powers of a currency must be the _same_, allowance being made for
transport charges and import and export taxes; for otherwise a movement
of trade would occur in order to take advantage of the inequality.
(4) It follows, therefore, from (1), (2), and (3) that the rate of
exchange between the home-currency and the foreign-currency must
tend in equilibrium to be the ratio between the purchasing powers of
the home-currency at home and of the foreign-currency in the foreign
country. This ratio between the respective home purchasing powers of
the two currencies is designated their “purchasing power parity.”

If, therefore, we find that the internal and external purchasing
powers of the home-currency are widely different, and, which is the
same thing, that the actual exchange rates differ widely from the
purchasing power parities, then we are justified in inferring that
equilibrium is not established, and that, as time goes on, forces will
come into play to bring the actual exchange rates and the purchasing
power parities nearer together. The actual exchanges are often more
sensitive and more volatile than the purchasing power parities, being
subject to speculation, to sudden movements of funds, to seasonal
influences, and to _anticipations_ of impending changes in purchasing
power parity (due to relative inflation or deflation); though also on
other occasions they may lag behind. Nevertheless it is the purchasing
power parity, according to this doctrine, which corresponds to the old
gold par. This is the point about which the exchanges fluctuate, and at
which they must ultimately come to rest; with one material difference,
namely, that it is not itself a fixed point,--since, if internal prices
move differently in the two countries under comparison, the purchasing
power parity also moves, so that equilibrium may be restored, not only
by a movement in the market rate of exchange, but also by a movement of
the purchasing power parity itself.

At first sight this theory appears to be one of great practical
utility; and many persons have endeavoured to draw important practical
conclusions about the future course of the exchanges from charts
exhibiting the divergences between the market rate of exchange and the
purchasing power parities,--undeterred by the perplexity whether an
existing divergence from equilibrium will be remedied by a movement of
the exchanges or of the purchasing power parity or of both.

In practical applications of the doctrine there are, however, two
further difficulties, which we have allowed so far to escape our
attention,--both of them arising out of the words _allowance being
made for transport charges and import and export taxes_. The first
difficulty is how to make allowance for such charges and taxes. The
second difficulty is how to treat purchasing power over goods and
services which _do not enter into international trade at all_.

The doctrine, in the form in which it is generally applied, endeavours
to deal with the first difficulty by assuming that the percentage
difference between internal and external purchasing power at some
standard date, when approximate equilibrium may be presumed to have
existed, generally the year 1913, may be taken as an approximately
satisfactory correction for the same disturbing factors at the present
time. For example, instead of calculating directly the cost of a
standard set of goods at home and abroad respectively, the calculations
are made that $2 are required to buy in the United States a standard
set which $1 would have bought in 1913, and that £2·43 are required to
buy in England what £1 would have bought in 1913. On this basis (the
pre-war purchasing power parity being assumed to be in equilibrium
with the pre-war exchange of $4·86 = £1) the present purchasing power
parity between dollars and sterling is given by $4 = £1, since 4·86 ×
2 ÷ 2·43 = 4.

The obvious objection to this method of correction is that transport
and tariff costs, especially if this term is taken to cover all
export and import regulations, including prohibitions and official or
semi-official combines for differentiating between export and home
prices, are notoriously widely different in many cases from those which
existed in 1913. We should not get the same result if we were to take
some year other than 1913 as the basis of the calculation.

The second difficulty--the treatment of purchasing power over articles
which do not enter into international trade--is still more serious.
For, if we restrict ourselves to articles entering into international
trade and make exact allowance for transport and tariff costs, we
should find that the theory is always in accordance with the facts,
with perhaps a short time-lag, the purchasing power parity being never
very far from the market rate of exchange. Indeed, it is the whole
business of the international merchant to see that this is so; for
whenever the rates are temporarily out of parity he is in a position
to make a profit by moving goods. The prices of cotton in New York,
Liverpool, Havre, Hamburg, Genoa, and Prague, expressed in dollars,
sterling, francs, marks, lire, and krone respectively, are never for
any length of time much divergent from one another on the basis of
the exchange rates actually obtaining in the market, due allowance
being made for tariffs and the cost of moving cotton from one centre to
another; and the same is true of other articles of international trade,
though with an increasing time-lag as we pass to articles which are
not standardised or are not handled in organised markets. In fact, the
theory, stated thus, is a truism, and as nearly as possible jejune.

For this reason practical applications of the theory are not thus
restricted. The standard set of commodities selected is not confined
to goods which are exported from and imported into the countries
under comparison, but is the same set, generally speaking, as is used
for compiling index numbers of general purchasing power or of the
working-class cost of living. Yet applied in this way--namely, in a
comparison of movements of the _general_ index numbers of home prices
in two countries with movements in the rates of exchange between their
currencies--the theory requires a further assumption for its validity,
namely, that in the long run the home prices of the goods and services
which do not enter into international trade, move in more or less the
same proportions as those which do.[27]

       [27] “Our calculation of the purchasing power parity rests
            strictly on the proviso that the rise in prices in the
            countries concerned has affected all commodities in a like
            degree. If that proviso is not fulfilled, then the actual
            exchange rate may deviate from the calculated purchasing
            power parity.” Cassel, _Money and Foreign Exchange after
            1914_, p. 154.

So far from this being a truism, it is not literally or exactly true
at all; and one can only say that it is more or less true according
to circumstances. If capital and labour can freely move on a large
scale between home and export industries without loss of relative
efficiency, if there is no movement in the “equation of exchange” (see
below) with the other country, and if the fluctuations in price are
solely due to monetary influences and not to changes in other economic
relationships between the two countries, then this further assumption
may be approximately justified. But this is not always the case; and
such a cataclysm as the war, with its various consequences to victor
and vanquished, may set up a new equilibrium position. There may, for
example, be a change more or less permanent, or at least as prolonged
as the reparation payments, in the relative exchange values of
Germany’s imports and exports respectively, or of those German products
and services which can enter into international trade and those which
cannot. Or, again, the strengthening of the financial position of the
United States as against Europe, which has resulted from the war, may
have shifted the old equilibrium in a direction favourable to the
United States. In such cases it is not correct to assume that the
coefficients of purchasing power parity, calculated, as they generally
are calculated, by means of the relative variations of index numbers of
general purchasing power from their pre-war levels, must ultimately
approximate to the actual rates of exchange, or that internal and
external purchasing power must ultimately bear to one another the same
relation as in 1913.

The Index Number calculated for the United States by the Federal
Reserve Board illustrates how disturbing may be the influence of the
change since 1913 in the relative prices of imported goods, exported
goods, and commodities generally:

                 Goods         Goods           All
                Imported.    Exported.     Commodities.
  1913            100           100           100
  July 1922       128           165           165
  April 1923      156           186           169
  July 1923       141           170           159

Thus the theory does not provide a simple or ready-made measure of the
“true” value of the exchanges. When it is restricted to foreign-trade
goods, it is little better than a truism. When it is not so restricted,
the conception of purchasing power parity becomes much more
interesting, but is no longer an accurate forecaster of the course of
the foreign exchanges. If, therefore, we follow the ordinary practice
of fixing purchasing power parity by comparisons of the _general_
purchasing power of a country’s currency at home and abroad, then we
must not infer from this that the actual rate of exchange _ought_ to
stand at the purchasing power parity, or that it is only a matter of
time and adjustment before the two will return to equality. Purchasing
power parity, thus defined, tells us an important fact about the
relative changes in the purchasing power of money in (_e.g._) England
and the United States or Germany between 1913 and, say, 1923, but it
does not necessarily settle what the equilibrium exchange rate in 1923
between sterling and dollars or marks ought to be.

Thus defined “purchasing power parity” deserves attention, even though
it is not always an accurate forecaster of the foreign exchanges. The
practical importance of our qualifications must not be exaggerated.
If the fluctuations of purchasing power parity are markedly different
from the fluctuations in the exchanges, this indicates an actual or
impending change in the relative prices of the two classes of goods
which respectively do and do not enter into international trade. Now
there is certainly a tendency for movements in the prices of these
two classes of goods to influence one another in the long run. The
relative valuation placed on them is derived from deep economic and
psychological causes which are not easily disturbed. If, therefore, the
divergence from the pre-existing equilibrium is mainly due to monetary
causes (as, for example, different degrees of inflation or deflation in
the two countries), as it often is, then we may reasonably expect that
purchasing power parity and exchange value will come together again
before long.

When this is the case, it is not possible to say in general whether
exchange value will move towards purchasing power parity or the other
way round. Sometimes, as recently in Europe, it is the exchanges
which are the more sensitive to impending relative price-changes and
move first; whilst in other cases the exchanges may not move until
after the change in the relation between the internal and external
price-levels is an accomplished fact. But the essence of the purchasing
power parity theory, considered as an explanation of the exchanges,
is to be found, I think, in its regarding internal purchasing power
as being in the long run a more trustworthy indicator of a currency’s
value than the market rates of exchange, because internal purchasing
power quickly reflects the monetary policy of the country, which is
the final determinant. If the market rates of exchange fall further
than the country’s existing or impending currency policy justifies by
its effect on the internal purchasing power of the country’s money,
then sooner or later the exchange value is bound to recover. Thus,
provided no persisting change is taking place in the basic economic
relations between two countries, and provided the internal purchasing
power of the currency has in each country settled down to equilibrium
in relation to the currency policy of the authorities, then the rate
of exchange between the currencies of the two countries must also
settle down in the long run to correspond with their comparative
internal purchasing powers. Subject to these assumptions comparative
internal purchasing power does take the place of the old gold parity
as furnishing the point about which the short-period movements of the
exchanges fluctuate.

If, on the other hand, these assumptions are not fulfilled and changes
are taking place in the “equation of exchange,” as economists call it,
between the services and products of one country and those of another,
either on account of movements of capital, or reparation payments, or
changes in the relative efficiency of labour, or changes in the urgency
of the world’s demand for that country’s special products, or the like,
then the equilibrium point between purchasing power parity and the rate
of exchange may be modified permanently.

This point may be made clearer by an example. Let us consider two
countries, Westropa and the United States of the Hesperides, and let
us assume for the sake of simplicity, and also because it may often
correspond to the facts, that in both countries the price of exported
goods moves in the same way as the price of other home-produced
goods, but that the “equation of exchange” has moved in favour of the
Hesperides so that a smaller number than before of units of Hesperidean
products exchange for a given quantity of Westropean products. It
follows from this that imported products in Westropa will rise in
price more than commodities generally, whilst in the Hesperides
they will rise less. Let us suppose that between 1913 and 1923 the
Westropean index number of prices has risen from 100 to 155 and the
Hesperidean index number from 100 to 160; that these index numbers are
so constructed in each case that imported commodities constitute 20
per cent and home-produced commodities 80 per cent of the whole; and
that the “equation of exchange” has moved 10 per cent in favour of
the Hesperides, that is to say a given quantity of the goods exported
by the Hesperides will buy 10 per cent more than before of the goods
exported by Europe. The state of affairs is then as follows:[28]

  _Westropa_: Price index of imported commodities (_x_) 167.
                   „       home-produced   „      (_y_) 152.
                   „       all             „            155.
  _Hesperides_:    „       imported        „     (_x´_) 148.
                   „       home-produced   „     (_y´_) 163.
                   „       all             „            160.

[Footnote 28:

                     For 10_x_ = 11_y_
                   8_y_ + 2_x_ = 1550

                        11_x´_ = 10_y´_
                 8_y´_ + 2_x´_ = 1600.
]

Thus it appears that the purchasing power parity of the Westropean
currency in 1923 compared with 1913 is (160/155 = )103; whereas the
rate of exchange, compared with the 1913 parity, is (163/167 = 148/152
= )97. If the worsening of Westropa’s equation of exchange with the
Hesperides is permanent, then its purchasing power parity (on the 1913
basis) will also remain permanently above the equilibrium value of the
market rate of exchange.

A tendency of these two measures of the value of a country’s currency
to move differently is, therefore, a highly interesting symptom. If the
market rate of exchange shows a continuing tendency to stand below the
purchasing power parity, we have, failing any other explanation, some
reason to suspect a worsening of the “equation of exchange” as compared
with the base year.

In the charts and tables below, the actual results are worked out of
applying the theory to the exchange value of sterling, francs, and lire
in terms of dollars since 1919. The figures show that, quantitatively
speaking, the influences, which detract from the precision of the
purchasing power parity theory, have been in these cases small, on the
whole, as compared with those which function in accord with it. There
seems to have been some disturbance in the “equations of exchange”
since 1913,--which would probably show up more distinctly if it were
not that the index numbers employed in the following enquiry are
of the type which is largely built up from articles entering into
international trade. Nevertheless general price changes, affecting
all commodities more or less equally, due to currency inflation or
deflation, have been so dominant in their influence that the theory
has been actually applicable with remarkable accuracy. In the case,
however, of such countries as Germany, where the shocks to equilibrium
have been much more violent in many respects, the concordance between
the purchasing power parity based on 1913 and the actual rate of
exchange has suffered, whether temporarily or permanently, very great
disturbance.

The first of these charts, which deals with the value of sterling
in terms of dollars, shows that whilst the purchasing power parity,
calculated with 1913 as base, is often somewhat above the actual
exchange, there is a persevering tendency for the two to come together.
The two curves are within one point of each other in September-November
1919, March-April 1920, April 1921, September 1921, January-June 1922,
and February-June 1923, which is certainly a remarkable illustration
of the tendency to concordance between the purchasing power parity
and the rate of exchange. On inductive grounds it would be tempting
to conclude from this chart that the financial consequences of the
war have depressed the equilibrium of the purchasing power parity of
sterling as against the dollar from 1 to 2½ per cent since 1913, if it
were not that this figure barely exceeds the margin of error resulting
from the choice of one pair of index numbers rather than another from
amongst those available.[29] It will be interesting to see what effect
is produced by the payment, just commenced, of the interest on the
American debt.

       [29] Nevertheless, if I had used the Board of Trade or the
            _Statist_ index number in place of the _Economist_ index
            number in the table below, the presumption of a slight
            worsening of the “equation of index” against Great Britain
            would be somewhat strengthened.

This chart brings out clearly, as also do those for France and
Italy, the susceptibility of the foreign exchange rates to seasonal
influences, whereas the purchasing power parity is naturally less
affected by them.

In the case of France the curves are together at the end of 1919,
diverge in 1920, come together again in the middle of 1921, and keep
together until a divergence occurred again in the latter part of 1922.

For Italy, rather unexpectedly perhaps, the relationship is
extraordinarily steady, although here, as in the case of France and
Great Britain, there are indications that the war may have resulted
in a slight lowering of the equilibrium point, by (say) 10 per
cent;[30]--the parity, calculated with 1913 as the base year, has been
almost invariably somewhat above the actual rate of exchange. The
Italian curve illustrates in a remarkable way the manner in which the
external and internal purchasing powers of the currency fall together,
when the main influence at work is a progressive depreciation due to
currency inflation.

       [30] The use of any of the other Italian index numbers would
            have accentuated this indication. The table of American
            prices given on p. 94 above confirms the suggestion that
            the “equation of exchange” between the U.S. and the rest of
            the world as a whole has moved, say, 10 per cent in favour
            of the former.

The broad effect of these curves and tables is to give substantial
inductive support to the general theory outlined above, even under such
abnormal conditions as have existed since the Armistice. During this
period the movements of the relative price level in France and Italy
due to monetary inflation have been so much larger than any shifting
in the “equation of exchange” (a movement of more than 10 or 20 per
cent in which would be startling) that their foreign exchanges have
been much more influenced by their internal price policy in relation
to the internal price policies of other countries than by any other
factor; with the result that the Purchasing Power Parity Theory, even
in its crude form, has worked passably well.

III. _The Seasonal Fluctuation._

Thus the Theory of Purchasing Power Parity tells us that movements in
the rate of exchange between the currencies of two countries tend,
subject to adjustment in respect of movements in the “equation of
exchange,” to correspond pretty closely to movements in the internal
price levels of the two countries each expressed in their own currency.
It follows that the rate of exchange can be improved in favour of one
of the countries by a financial policy directed towards a lowering
of its internal price level relatively to the internal price level
of the other country. On the other hand a financial policy which has
the effect of raising the internal price level must result, sooner or
later, in depressing the rate of exchange.

The conclusion is generally drawn, and quite correctly, that budgetary
deficits covered by a progressive inflation of the currency render
the stabilisation of a country’s exchanges impossible; and that the
cessation of any increase in the volume of currency, due to this cause,
is a necessary pre-requisite to a successful attempt at stabilising.

The argument, however, is often carried further than this, and it is
supposed that, if a country’s budget, currency, foreign trade, and
its internal and external price levels are properly adjusted, then,
automatically, its foreign exchange will be steady.[36] So long,
therefore, as the exchanges fluctuate--thus the argument runs--this
in itself is a symptom that an attempt to stabilise would be
premature. When, on the other hand, the basic conditions necessary for
stabilisation are present, the exchange will steady itself. In short,
any deliberate or artificial scheme of stabilisation is attacking the
problem at the wrong end. It is the regulation of the currency, by
means of sound budgetary and bank-rate policies, that needs attention.
The proclamation of convertibility will be the last and crowning
stage of the proceedings, and will amount to little more than the
announcement of a _fait accompli_.

       [36] Dr. R. Estcourt, criticising one of my articles in _The
            Annalist_ for June 12, 1922, writes: “The arrangement
            would not last for any appreciable period unless, as a
            preliminary, the Governments took the necessary steps to
            balance their budgets. If that were done, the so-called
            stabilisation speedily would become unnecessary; exchange
            would stabilise itself at pre-war rates.” This passage puts
            boldly an opinion which is widely held.

There is a certain force in this mode of reasoning. But in one
important respect it is fallacious.

Even though foreign trade is properly adjusted, and the country’s
claims and liabilities on foreign account are in equilibrium over
the year as a whole, it does not follow that they are in equilibrium
every day. Indeed, it is well known that countries which import large
quantities of agricultural produce do not find it convenient, if they
are to secure just the quality and the amount which they require, to
buy at an equal rate throughout the year, but prefer to concentrate
their purchases on the autumn period.[37] Thus, quite consistently
with equilibrium over the year as a whole, industrial countries
tend to owe money to agricultural countries in the second half of
the year, and to repay in the first half. The satisfaction of these
seasonal requirements for credit with the least possible disturbance
to trade was recognised before the war as an important function of
international banking, and the seasonal transference of short-term
credits from one centre to another was carried out for a moderate
commission.

       [37] Whilst the fact of seasonal pressure is well ascertained,
            the exact analysis of it is a little complicated. Food
            arrivals into Great Britain, for example, are nearly 10
            per cent heavier in the third and fourth quarters of the
            year than in the first and second, and reach their maximum
            in the fourth quarter. (These and the following figures
            are based on averages for the pre-war period 1901–1913
            worked out by the Cambridge and London Economic Service).
            Raw material imports are more than 20 per cent heavier
            in the fourth and first quarters than in the second and
            third, and reach their maximum in the three months November
            to January. Thus the fourth quarter of the year is the
            period at which there are heavy imports of both food and
            raw materials. Manufactured exports, on the other hand,
            are distributed through the year much more evenly, and are
            about normal during the last quarter. Allowing for the fact
            that imports are paid for, generally speaking, before they
            arrive, these dates correspond pretty closely with the date
            at which seasonal pressure is actually experienced by the
            dollar-sterling exchange. In France, since the war, imports
            in the last quarter of the year seem to have been quite 50
            per cent heavier than, for example, in the first quarter.
            In Italy the third quarter seems to be the slackest, and
            the last quarter, again, a relatively heavy period. When we
            turn to the statistics for the United States we find the
            other side of the picture. August and September are the
            months of heavy wheat export; October to January those of
            heavy cotton export. The strength of the dollar exchanges
            in the early autumn is further increased by the financial
            pressure in the United States during the crop-moving
            period, which leads to a withdrawal of funds from foreign
            centres to New York.

It was possible for this service to be rendered cheaply because, with
the certainty provided by convertibility, the price paid for it did
not need to include any appreciable provision against risk. A somewhat
higher rate of discount in the temporarily debtor country, together
with a small exchange profit provided by the slight shift of the
exchanges within the gold points, was quite sufficient.

But what is the position now? As always, the balance of payments
must balance every day. As before, the balance of trade is spread
unevenly through the year. Formerly the daily balance was adjusted by
the movement of bankers’ funds, as described above. But now it is no
longer a purely bankers’ business, suitably and sufficiently rewarded
by an arbitrage profit. If a banker moves credits temporarily from
one country to another, he cannot be certain at what rate of exchange
he will be able to bring them back again later on. Even though he may
have a strong opinion as to the probable course of exchange, his profit
is no longer definitely calculable beforehand, as it used to be; he
has learnt by experience that unforeseen movements of the exchange
may involve him in heavy loss; and his prospective profit must be
commensurate with the risk he runs. Even if he thinks that the risk is
covered actuarially by the prospective profit, a banker cannot afford
to run such risks on a large scale. In fact, the seasonal adjustment of
credit requirements has ceased to be arbitrage banking business, and
demands the services of speculative finance.

Under present conditions, therefore, a large fluctuation of the
exchange may be necessary before the daily account can be balanced,
even though the annual account is level. Where in the old days a banker
would have readily remitted millions to and from New York, hundreds
of thousands are now as much as the biggest institutions will risk.
The exchange must fall (or rise, as the case may be) until either the
speculative financier feels sufficiently confident of a large profit to
step in, or the merchant, appalled by the rate of exchange quoted to
him for the transaction, decides to forgo the convenience of purchasing
at that particular season of the year, and postpones a part of his
purchases.

The services of the professional exchange speculator, being discouraged
by official and banking influences, are generally in short supply, so
that a heavy price has to be paid for them, and trade is handicapped
by a corresponding expense, in so far as it continues to purchase its
materials at the most convenient season of the year.

The extent to which the exchange fluctuations which have troubled trade
during the past three years have been seasonal, and therefore due, not
to a continuing or increasing disequilibrium, but merely to the absence
of a fixed exchange, is not, I think, fully appreciated.

During 1919 there was a heavy fall of the chief European exchanges due
to the termination of the inter-Allied arrangements which had existed
during the war. During 1922 there was a rise of the sterling exchange,
which was independent of seasonal influences. During 1923 there has
been a further non-seasonal collapse of the franc exchange due to
certain persisting features of France’s internal finances and external
policy. But the following table shows how largely _recurrent_ the
fluctuations have been during the four years since the autumn of 1919:--

 +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
 |August-July.|     Sterling.    |      Francs.     |       Lire.      |
 |            | Lowest. Highest. | Lowest. Highest. | Lowest. Highest. |
 +------------|------------------+------------------+------------------+
 | 1919–1920  |    69      88    |   31      66     |    22     56     |
 | 1920–1921  |    69      82    |   30      45     |    18     29     |
 | 1921–1922  |    73      92    |   37      48     |    20     28     |
 | 1922–1923  |    90      97    |   29      41     |    20     27     |
 +------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+

On the experience of the past three years, francs and lire are at their
best in April and May and at their worst between October and December.
Sterling is not quite so punctual in its movements, the best point of
the year falling somewhere between March and June and the worst between
August and November.

The comparative stability of the highest and lowest quotations
respectively in each year, especially in the case of Italy, is very
striking, and indicates that a policy of stabilisation at some mean
figure might have been practicable; whilst, on the other hand, the wide
divergences between the highest and lowest are a measure of the expense
and interference that trade has suffered.

These results correspond so closely to the facts of seasonal trade
(see above, p. 108) that we may safely attribute most of the major
fluctuations of the exchanges from month to month to the actual
pressure of trade remittances, and not to speculation. Speculators,
indeed, by anticipating the movements tend to make them occur a little
earlier than they would occur otherwise, but by thus spreading the
pressure more evenly through the year their influence is to diminish
the absolute amount of the fluctuation. General opinion greatly
overestimates the influence of exchange-speculators acting under the
stimulus of merely political and sentimental considerations. Except
for brief periods the influence of the speculator is washed out; and
political events can only exert a lasting influence on the exchanges,
in so far as they modify the internal price level, the volume of trade,
or the ability of a country to borrow on foreign markets. A political
event, which does not materially affect any of these facts, cannot
exert a lasting effect on the exchanges merely by its influence on
sentiment. The only important exception to this statement is where
there exists on a large scale a long-period speculative investment in a
country’s currency on the part of foreigners, as in the case of German
marks. But such investments are comparable to borrowing abroad and
exercise a different kind of influence altogether from a speculative
transaction proper, which is opened with the intention of its being
closed again within a short period. And even speculative investment
in a currency, since it is bound to diminish sooner or later, cannot
permanently prevent the exchanges from reaching the equilibrium
justified by conditions of trading and relative price levels.

It follows that, whilst purely seasonal fluctuations do not interfere
with the forces which determine the ultimate equilibrium of the
exchanges, nevertheless stability of the exchange from day to day
cannot be maintained merely by the _fact_ of stability in these
underlying conditions. It is necessary also that bankers should have a
sufficiently certain _expectation_ of such stability to induce them to
look after the daily and seasonal fluctuations of the market in return
for a moderate commission.

After recent experience it is unlikely that they will actually
entertain any such expectation, even if the underlying facts were of
a kind to justify it, with sufficient conviction to act, unless it is
backed up by a guarantee on the part of the Central Authority (Bank or
Government) to employ all their resources for the maintenance of the
level of exchange at a stated figure. At present the declared official
policy is to bring the franc and the lira (for example) back to par,
so that operations favouring a fall of these currencies are not free
from danger. On the other hand no steps are taken to make this policy
effective, and the conditions of internal finance in France and Italy
indicate that their exchanges may go much worse. Thus, since no one can
have complete confidence whether they are to be a great deal better or
very much worse, there must be a wide fluctuation before financiers
will come in, purely from motives of self-interest, to balance the
day-to-day fluctuations and the month-to-month fluctuations round about
the unpredictable point of equilibrium.

If, therefore, the exchanges are not stabilised by policy, they
will never come to an equilibrium of themselves. As time goes on
and experience accumulates, the oscillations may be smaller than at
present. Speculators may come in a little sooner, and importers may
make greater efforts to spread their requirements more evenly over the
year. But even so, there must be a substantial difference of rates
between the busy season and the slack season, until the business world
knows for certain at what level the exchanges in question are going to
settle down. Thus a seasonal fluctuation of the exchanges (including
the sterling-dollar exchange) is inevitable, even in the absence of
any decided long-period tendency of an exchange to rise or to fall,
unless the Central Authority, by a guarantee of convertibility or
otherwise, takes special steps to provide against it.


IV. _The Forward Market in Exchanges._

When a merchant buys or sells goods in a foreign currency the
transaction is not always for immediate settlement by cash or
negotiable bill. During the interval before he can cover himself by
buying or selling (as the case may be) the foreign currency involved,
he runs an exchange risk, losses or gains on which may often, in these
days, swamp his trading profit. He is thus involuntarily engaged in a
heavy risk of a kind which it is hardly in his province to undertake.
The subject of what follows is a piece of financial machinery--namely,
the market in “forward” exchanges as distinguished from “spot”
exchanges--for enabling the merchant to avoid this risk, not, indeed,
during the interval when he is negotiating the contract, but as soon as
the negotiation is completed.

Transactions in “spot” exchange are for cash--that is to say, cash in
one currency is exchanged for cash in another currency. But merchants
who have bought goods in terms of foreign currency for future delivery
may not have the cash available pending delivery of the goods; whilst
merchants who have sold goods in terms of foreign currency, but are
not yet in a position to sell a draft on the buyer, cannot, even if
they have plenty of cash in their own currency, protect themselves by a
“spot” sale of the exchange involved, save in the exceptional case when
they have cash available in the foreign currency also.

A “forward” contract is for the conclusion of a “spot” transaction
in exchanges at a later date, fixed on the basis of the spot rate
prevailing at the original date. Pending the date of the maturity
of the forward contract no cash need pass (although, of course, the
contracting party may be required to give some security or other
evidence for his ability to complete the contract in due course), so
that the merchant entering into a forward contract is not required to
find cash any sooner than if he ran the risk on the exchange until the
goods were delivered; yet he is protected from the consequences of any
fluctuation in the exchanges in the meantime.

The tables given below show that in London, in the case of the
exchanges which have a big market (the dollar, the franc, and the
lira), competition between dealers has brought down the charges for
these facilities to a fairly moderate rate. During 1920 and 1921 the
cost to an English buyer of foreign currency for forward delivery
was a little more expensive than for spot delivery in the case of
francs, lire, and marks, and a little cheaper in the case of dollars.
Correspondingly, French, Italian, and German merchants were generally
in a position to buy both sterling and dollars for forward delivery
at a slightly cheaper rate than for spot delivery--that is to say, if
they dealt in London. As regards the rates charged in foreign centres
my information is not extensive, but it indicates that in Milan,
for example, very much less favourable terms for these transactions
are frequently charged to the seller of forward sterling than those
ruling in London. During 1922, however, the effect of the progressive
cheapening of money in London was, for reasons to be explained in a
moment, to cheapen the cost to English buyers of foreign currency for
forward delivery, forward francs falling to an appreciable discount
on spot francs, and forward dollars becoming at the end of the year
decidedly cheaper than spot dollars. Later on, the raising of the
bank-rate in June 1923 acted again, as could have been predicted, in
the opposite direction.

Proceeding to details, we see below (pp. 118, 119) the quotations for
forward exchange ruling in the London market since the beginning of
1920. During 1920–21 forward dollars were generally cheaper than spot
dollars to a London buyer to the extent of from 1 to 1½ per cent per
annum. Occasionally, however, when big movements of the exchange were
taking place, the discount on forward dollars was temporarily much
higher, having risen, for example, in November 1920, when sterling
was at its lowest point, to nearly 6 per cent--for reasons which I
will endeavour to elucidate later. During the first half of 1922 the
discount on forward dollars dwindled, but rose again during the latter
half of the year, reacting again in the middle of 1923 after money
rates in London had been slightly raised. Thus a London merchant, who
has had dollar commitments for the purchase of goods, has not only been
able to cover his exchange risk by means of a forward transaction, but
on the average he has got his exchange a little cheaper by providing
for it in advance.

       [38] Nominal.

Forward purchases of francs, after being dearer than spot transactions
by 2½ per cent per annum or more from the middle of 1920 to the middle
of 1921, were nearly level in price from the middle of 1921 to the
middle of 1922, whilst since that time they have been ½ to 2½ per cent
per annum cheaper. In the case of lire there have been much wider gaps,
forward purchases being frequently 3 per cent or more dearer than
spot. In the case of German marks, the forward rate, after ranging
round about 5 per cent per annum dearer than spot, has reached, since
the autumn of 1922 and the complete collapse of the mark, a figure
fantastically cheaper, thus reflecting the sensational rate of interest
for short loans current inside Germany.

But in all these cases (except in Germany since the complete collapse
of the mark), whether forward exchange is at a discount or at a
premium on spot, the expense, if any, of dealing forward has been small
in relation to the risks that are avoided.

Nevertheless, in practice merchants do not avail themselves of these
facilities to the extent that might have been expected. The nature of
forward dealings in exchange is not generally understood. The rates
are seldom quoted in the newspapers. There are few financial topics of
equal importance which have received so little discussion or publicity.
The present situation did not exist before the war (although even at
that time forward rates for the dollar were regularly quoted), and did
not begin until after the “unpegging” of the leading exchanges in 1919,
so that the business world has only begun to adapt itself. Moreover,
for the ordinary man, dealing in forward exchange has, it seems, a
smack of speculation about it. Unlike Manchester cotton spinners, who
have learnt by long experience that it is not the hedging of open
cotton commitments on the Liverpool futures market, but the failure to
do so, which is speculative, merchants, who buy or sell goods of which
the price is expressed in a foreign currency, do not yet regard it as
part of the normal routine of prudent business to hedge these indirect
exchange commitments by a transaction in forward exchange.

It is important, on the other hand, not to exaggerate the extent to
which, at the present time, merchants can by this means protect
themselves from risk. In the first place, for reasons, some of which
will be considered below, it is only in certain of the leading
exchanges that these transactions can be carried out at a reasonable
charge. It is not clear that even the banks themselves have yet learnt
to look on the provision for their clients of such facilities at fair
and reasonable rates as one of the most useful services they can offer.
They have been too much influenced, perhaps, by the fear that these
facilities might tend at the same time to increase speculation.

But there is a further qualification, not to be overlooked, to the
value of forward transactions as a protection against risk. The price
of a particular commodity, in terms of a particular currency, does
not exactly respond to changes in the value of that currency on the
exchange markets of the world, with the result that a movement in a
country’s exchanges may, in the case of a commodity of which that
country is a large seller or a large purchaser, change the commodity’s
world-value expressed in terms of gold. In that case a merchant, even
though he is hedged in respect of the exchange itself, may lose,
in respect of his unsold trading stocks, through a movement in the
world-value of the commodity he is dealing in, directly occasioned by
the exchange fluctuation.

If we turn to the theoretical analysis of the forward market, what is
it that determines the amount and the sign (whether plus or minus) of
the divergence between the spot and forward rates as recorded above?

If dollars one month forward are quoted cheaper than spot dollars
to a London buyer in terms of sterling, this indicates a preference
by the market, on balance, in favour of holding funds in New York
during the month in question rather than in London,--a preference the
degree of which is measured by the discount on forward dollars. For
if spot dollars are worth $4.40 to the pound and dollars one month
forward $4.40½ to the pound, then the owner of $4.40 can, by selling
the dollars spot and buying them back one month forward, find himself
at the end of the month with $4.40½, merely by being during the
month the owner of £1 in London instead of $4.40 in New York. That
he should require and can obtain half a cent, which, earned in one
month, is equal to about 1½ per cent per annum, to induce him to do the
transaction, shows, and is, under conditions of competition, a measure
of, the market’s preference for holding funds during the month in
question in New York rather than in London.

Conversely, if francs, lire, and marks one month forward are quoted
dearer than the spot rates to a London buyer, this indicates a
preference for holding funds in London rather than in Paris, Rome, or
Berlin.

The difference between the spot and forward rates is, therefore,
precisely and exactly the measure of the preference of the money and
exchange market for holding funds in one international centre rather
than in another, _the exchange risk apart_, that is to say under
conditions in which the exchange risk is covered. What is it that
determines these preferences?

1. The most fundamental cause is to be found in the interest rates
obtainable on “short” money--that is to say, on money lent or deposited
for short periods of time in the money markets of the two centres under
comparison. If by lending dollars in New York for one month the lender
could earn interest at the rate of 5½ per cent per annum, whereas by
lending sterling in London for one month he could only earn interest
at the rate of 4 per cent, then the preference observed above for
holding funds in New York rather than in London is wholly explained.
That is to say, forward quotations for the purchase of the currency of
the dearer money market tend to be cheaper than spot quotations by a
percentage per month equal to the excess of the interest which can be
earned in a month in the dearer market over what can be earned in the
cheaper. It must be noticed that the governing factor is the rate of
interest obtainable for short periods, so that a country where, owing
to the absence or ill-development of an organised money market, it
is difficult to lend money satisfactorily at call or for very short
periods, may, for the purposes of this calculation, reckon as a low
interest-earning market, even though the prevailing rate of interest
for longer periods is not low at all. This consideration generally
tends to make London and New York more attractive markets for short
money than any Continental centres.

The effect of the cheap money rates ruling in London from the middle of
1922 to the middle of 1923 in diminishing the attractiveness of London
as a depository of funds is strikingly shown, in the above tables,
by the cheapening of the forward quotations of foreign currencies
relatively to the spot quotations. In the case of the dollar the
forward quotation had risen by the beginning of 1923 to a rate 3 per
cent per annum above the spot quotation (_i.e._ forward dollars were 3
per cent per annum _cheaper_ than spot dollars in terms of sterling),
which meant (subject to modification by the other influences to be
mentioned below) that the effective rate for short loans approached 3
per cent higher in New York than in London.

In the case of francs forward quotations which had been below spot,
so long as money was dear in London, rose above the spot quotations,
thus indicating that the relative dearness of money in London as
compared with Paris had disappeared; whilst in the case of lire forward
quotations, although still below spot quotations, rose, under the same
influence, nearer to the spot level. Nevertheless, in the case of both
these currencies, a preponderance of bearish anticipations about their
future prospects probably also played a part, for the reasons given in
detail below, in producing the observed result.

The most interesting figures, however, are those relating to marks,
which illustrate vividly what I have mentioned on page 23 above
concerning the enormous money rates of interest current in Germany
subsequent to the collapse of October 1922, as a result of the effort
of the real rate of interest to remain positive in face of a general
anticipation of a catastrophic collapse of the monetary unit. It will
be noticed that the effective short money rate of interest in terms
of marks ranged from 50 per cent per annum upwards, until finally the
quotations were merely nominal.

2. If questions of credit did not enter in, the factor of the rate of
interest on short loans would be the dominating one. Indeed, as between
London and New York, it probably is so under existing conditions.
Between London and Paris it is still important. But elsewhere the
various uncertainties of financial and political risk, which the
war has left behind, introduce a further element which sometimes
quite transcends the factor of relative interest. The possibility of
financial trouble or political disturbance, and the quite appreciable
probability of a moratorium in the event of any difficulties arising,
or of the sudden introduction of exchange regulations which would
interfere with the movement of balances out of the country, and
even sometimes the contingency of a drastic demonetisation,--all
these factors deter bankers, even when the exchange risk proper is
eliminated, from maintaining large floating balances at certain foreign
centres. Such risks prevent the business from being based, as it should
be, on a mathematical calculation of interest rates; they obliterate by
their possible magnitude the small “turns” which can be earned out of
differences between interest rates plus a normal banker’s commission;
and, being incalculable, they may even deter conservative bankers from
doing the business on a substantial scale at any reasonable rate at
all. In the case of Roumania or Poland, for example, this factor is, at
times, the dominating one.

3. There is a third factor of some significance. We have assumed so
far that the forward rate is fixed at such a level that the dealer or
banker can cover himself by a simultaneous spot transaction and be left
with a reasonable profit for his trouble. But it is not necessary to
cover every forward transaction by a corresponding spot transaction; it
may be possible to “marry” a forward sale with a forward purchase of
the same currency. For example, whilst some of the market’s clients may
wish to sell forward dollars, other clients will wish to buy forward
dollars. In this case the market can set off these, one against the
other, in its books, and there will be no need of any movement of
cash funds in either direction. The third factor depends, therefore,
on whether it is the sellers or the buyers of forward dollars who
predominate. To fix our minds, let us suppose that money-market
conditions exist in which a sale of forward dollars against the
purchase of spot dollars, at a discount of 1½ per cent per annum for
the former, yields neither profit nor loss. Now if in these conditions
the purchasers of forward dollars, other than arbitragers, exceed
sellers of forward dollars, then this excess of demand for forward
dollars can be met by arbitragers, who have cash resources in London,
at a discount which falls short of 1½ per cent per annum by such amount
(say ½ per cent) as will yield the arbitragers sufficient profit for
their trouble. If, however, sellers of forward dollars exceed the
purchasers, then a sufficient discount has to be accepted by the former
to induce arbitrage the other way round--that is to say, by arbitragers
who have cash resources in New York--namely, a discount which exceeds
1½ per cent per annum by, say, ½ per cent. Thus the discount on forward
dollars will fluctuate between 1 and 2 per cent per annum according as
buyers or sellers predominate.

4. Lastly, we have to provide for the case, quite frequent in practice,
where our assumption of a large and free market breaks down. A business
in forward exchange can only be transacted by banks or similar
institutions. If the bulk of the business in a particular exchange is
in a few hands, or if there is a tacit agreement between the principal
institutions concerned to maintain differences which will allow more
than a competitive profit, then the surcharge representing the profit
of a bank for arbitraging between spot and forward transactions may
much exceed the moderate figure indicated above. The quotations of the
rates charged in Milan for forward dealings in lire, when compared
with the rates current in London at the same date, indicate that a
bank which is free to operate in both markets can frequently make an
abnormal profit.

But there is a further contingency of considerable importance which
occurs when speculation is exceptionally active and is all one way. It
must be remembered that the floating capital normally available, and
ready to move from centre to centre for the purpose of taking advantage
of moderate arbitrage profits between spot and forward exchange,
is by no means unlimited in amount, and is not always adequate to
the market’s requirements. When, for example, the market is feeling
unusually bullish of the European exchanges as against sterling, or
of sterling as against dollars, the pressure to sell forward sterling
or dollars, as the case may be, may drive the forward price of these
currencies to a discount on their spot price which represents an
altogether abnormal profit to any one who is in a position to buy
these currencies forward and sell them spot. This abnormal discount
can only disappear when the high profit of arbitrage between spot and
forward has drawn fresh capital into the arbitrage business. So few
persons understand even the elements of the theory of the forward
exchanges that there was an occasion in 1920, even between London and
New York, when a seller of spot dollars could earn at the rate of 6
per cent per annum above the London rate for short money by converting
his dollars into sterling and providing at the same time by a forward
sale of the sterling for reconversion into dollars in a month’s time;
whilst, according to figures supplied me, it was possible, at the end
of February 1921, by selling spot sterling in Milan and buying it back
a month forward, to earn at the rate of more than 25 per cent per annum
over and above any interest obtainable on a month’s deposit of cash
lire in Milan.

It is interesting to notice that when the differences between forward
and spot rates have become temporarily abnormal, thus indicating an
exceptional pressure of speculative activity, the speculators have
often turned out to be right. For example, the abnormal discount on
forward dollars, which persisted more or less from November 1920 to
February 1921, thus indicating that the market was a bull of sterling,
coincided with the sensational rise of sterling from 3.45 to 3.90.
This discount was at its maximum when sterling touched its lowest
point and at its minimum (in the middle of May 1921) when sterling
reached its highest point on that swing, which showed a remarkably
accurate anticipation of events by the balance of professional opinion.
The comparatively high discount on forward dollars current at the
end of 1922 may, in the same way, have been partly due to an excess
of bull speculation in favour of sterling based on an expectation of
its recovery towards par, and not merely to the cheapness of money in
London as compared with New York.

The same thing seems to have been true for the franc. In January and
February 1921, the abnormal premium on the forward franc indicated
that, in the view of the market, the franc had fallen too low, which
turned out to be the case. They turned round at the precise moment
when the franc reached its highest value (end of July 1921), and were
right again. During the first five months of 1922, when the franc was
almost stable, spot and forward quotations were practically at par with
one another, whilst the progressive fall of the franc since June 1922
has been accompanied by a steady and sometimes substantial discount on
forward francs; indicating, on this test, that the professional market
was bearish of francs and therefore right once more. The lira tells
somewhat the same tale. Thus, whilst the reader can see for himself by
a study of the tables that no precise generalisation would be accurate,
nevertheless the market has been broadly right when it has taken a
very decided view, as measured by forward rates.

This result may seem surprising in view of the huge amounts which
exchange speculators in European currencies, more particularly on
the bull side, are reputed to have lost. But the mass of amateur
speculators throughout the world operate by cash purchases of the
currency of which they are bulls, forward transactions being neither
known nor available to them. Such speculation may afford temporary
support to the spot exchange, but it has no influence on the difference
between spot and forward, the subject now under discussion. The above
conclusion is limited to the fact that when the type of professional
speculation which makes use of the forward market is exceptionally
active and united in its opinion, it has proved roughly correct,
and has, therefore, been a useful factor in moderating the extreme
fluctuations which would have occurred otherwise.

       *       *       *       *       *

Out of the various practical conclusions which might be drawn from this
discussion and the figures which accompany it, I will pick out three.

1. Those exchanges in which the fluctuations are wildest and the
merchant is most in need of facilities for hedging his risk are
precisely those in which facilities for forward dealing at moderate
rates are least developed. But this is to be explained, not
necessarily by the instability of the exchange in itself, but by
certain accompanying circumstances, such as distrust of the country’s
internal arrangements or its banking credit, a fear of the sudden
imposition of exchange regulations or of a moratorium, and the
other analogous influences mentioned above (pp. 126–7). There is no
theoretical reason why there should not be an excellent forward market
in a highly unstable exchange. In those countries, therefore, where
regulation is still premature, it may nevertheless be possible to
mitigate the evil consequences of fluctuation by organising facilities
for forward dealings.

This is a function which the State banks of such countries could
usefully perform. For this they must either themselves command a
certain amount of foreign currency or they must provide facilities for
accepting short-period deposits in their own currency from foreign
bankers, on conditions which inspire these bankers with complete
confidence in the freedom and liquidity of such deposits. Various
technical devices could be suggested. But the simplest method might be
for the State banks themselves to enter the forward market and offer
to buy or sell forward exchange at a reasonable discount or premium on
the spot quotation. I suggest that they should deal not direct with the
public but only with approved banks and financial houses, from whom
they should require adequate security; that they should quote every day
their rates for buying and selling exchange either one or three months
forward; but that such quotation should take the form, not of a price
for the exchange itself, but of a percentage difference between spot
and forward, and should be a quotation for the double transaction of
a spot deal one way and a simultaneous forward deal the other--_e.g._
the Bank of Italy might offer to sell spot sterling and buy forward
sterling at a premium of ⅛ per cent per month for the former over the
latter, and to buy spot sterling and sell forward sterling at par.
For the transaction of such business the State banks would require
to command a certain amount of resources abroad, either in cash or
in borrowing facilities. But this fund would be a revolving one,
automatically replenished at the maturity of the forward contracts, so
that it need not be on anything like the scale necessary for a fund
for the purpose of supporting the exchange. Nor is it a business which
involves any more risk than is inherent in all banking business as
such; from exchange risk proper is free.

With free forward markets thus established no merchant need run an
exchange risk unless he wishes to, and business might find a stable
foothold even in a fluctuating world. A recommendation in favour of
action along these lines was included amongst the Financial Resolutions
of the Genoa Conference of 1922.

I shall develop below (Chap. V.) a proposal that the Bank of England
should strengthen its control by fixing spot and forward prices for
gold every Thursday just as it now fixes its discount rate. But other
Central Banks also would increase their control over fluctuations in
exchange if they were to adopt the above plan of quoting rates for
forward exchange in terms of spot exchange. By varying these rates they
would be able, in effect, to vary the interest offered for _foreign_
balances, as a policy distinct from whatever might be their bank-rate
policy for the purpose of governing the interest obtainable on _home_
balances.

2. It is not unusual at present for banks to endeavour to distinguish
between speculative dealings in forward exchange and dealings which are
intended to hedge a commercial transaction, with a view to discouraging
the former; whilst official exchange regulations in many countries have
been aimed at such discrimination. I think that this is a mistake.
Banks should take stringent precautions to make sure that their clients
are in a position to meet any losses which may accrue without serious
embarrassment. But, having fully assured themselves on this point,
it is not useful that they should inquire further--for the following
reasons.

In the first place, it is almost impossible to prevent the evasion
of such regulations; whilst, if the business is driven to methods
of evasion, it tends to be pressed underground, to yield excessive
profits to middlemen, and to fall into undesirable hands.

But, what is more important and is less appreciated, the speculator
with resources can provide a useful, indeed almost an essential,
service. Since the volume of actual trade is spread unevenly through
the year, the seasonal fluctuation, as explained above, is bound to
occur with undue force unless some financial, non-commercial factor
steps in to balance matters. A free forward market, from which
speculative transactions are not excluded, will give by far the best
facilities for the trader, who does not wish to speculate, to avoid
doing so. The same sort of advantages will be secured for merchants
generally as are afforded, for example, to the cotton trade by the
dealings in “futures” in the New York and Liverpool markets. Where risk
is unavoidably present, it is much better that it should be carried by
those who are qualified or are desirous to bear it, than by traders,
who have neither the qualification nor the desire to do so, and whose
minds it distracts from their own business. The wide fluctuations in
the leading exchanges over the past three years, as distinct from
their persisting depreciation, have been due, not to the presence of
speculation, but to the absence of a sufficient volume of it relatively
to the volume of trade.

3. A failure to analyse the relation between spot and forward exchange
may be, sometimes, partly responsible for a mistaken bank-rate policy.
Dear money--that is to say, high interest rates for short-period
loans--has two effects. The one is indirect and gradual--namely, in
diminishing the volume of credit quoted by the banks. This effect is
much the same now as it always was. It is desirable to produce it when
prices are rising and business is trying to expand faster than the
supply of real capital and effective demand can permit in the long run.
It is undesirable when prices are falling and trade is depressed.

The other effect of dear money, or rather of dearer money in one centre
than in another, used to be to draw gold from the cheaper centre for
temporary employment in the dearer. But nowadays the only immediate
effect is to cause a new adjustment of the difference between the
spot and forward rates of exchange between the two centres. If money
becomes dearer in London, the discount on forward dollars diminishes or
gives way to a premium. The effect has been pointed out above of the
relative cheapening of money in London in the latter half of 1922 in
increasing the discount on forward dollars, and of the relative raising
of money-rates in the middle of 1923 in diminishing the discount. Such
are, in present circumstances, the principal direct consequences of a
moderate difference between interest rates in the two centres, apart,
of course, from the indirect, long-period influence. Since no one is
likely to remit money temporarily from one money market to another
on any important scale, with an uncovered exchange risk, merely to
take advantage of ½ or 1 per cent per annum difference in the interest
rate, the direct effect of dearer money on the _absolute_ level of
the exchanges, as distinguished from the difference between spot and
forward, is very small, being limited to the comparatively slight
influence which the relation between spot and forward rates exerts on
exchange speculators.[39] The pressure of arbitragers between spot
and forward exchange, seeking to take advantage of the new situation,
leads to a rapid adjustment of the difference between these rates,
until the business of temporary remittance, as distinct from exchange
speculation, is no more profitable than it was before, and consequently
does not occur on any increased scale; with the result that there is no
marked effect on the absolute level of the spot rate.

       [39] If interest rates are raised in London, the discount on
            forward dollars will decrease or a premium will appear.
            This is likely to have some influence in encouraging
            speculative sales of forward dollars (how much influence
            depends on the proportion borne by the difference
            between the spot and forward rates to the probable range
            of fluctuation of the spot rate which the speculator
            anticipates); and in so far as this is the case, the
            covering sales of spot dollars by banks will move the rate
            of exchange in favour of London.

The reasons given for the maintenance of a close relationship between
the Bank of England’s rate and that of the American Federal Reserve
Board sometimes show confusion. The eventual influence of an effective
high bank-rate on the general situation is undisputed; but the belief
that a moderate difference between bank-rates in London and New York
reacts directly on the sterling-dollar exchange, as it used to do under
a régime of convertibility, is a misapprehension. The direct reaction
of this difference is on the discount for forward dollars as against
spot dollars; and it cannot much affect the absolute level of the
spot rate unless the change in relative money-rates is comparable in
magnitude (as it used to be but no longer is) with the possible range
of exchange fluctuations.




CHAPTER IV

ALTERNATIVE AIMS IN MONETARY POLICY


Our first two chapters, on the evils proceeding from instability in the
purchasing power of money and on the part played by the exigencies of
Public Finance, have indicated the practical importance of our subject
to the welfare of society. In the third chapter an attempt has been
made to lay a foundation of theory upon which to raise constructions.
We can now turn, in this and the following chapter, to _Remedies_.

The instability of money has been compounded, in most countries except
the United States, of two elements: the failure of the national
currencies to remain stable in terms of what was supposed to be the
standard of value, namely gold; and the failure of gold itself to
remain stable in terms of purchasing power. Attention has been mainly
concentrated (_e.g._ by the Cunliffe Committee) on the first of these
two factors. It is often assumed that the restoration of the gold
standard, that is to say, of the convertibility of each national
currency at a fixed rate in terms of gold, must be, in any case, our
objective; and that the main question of controversy is whether
national currencies should be restored to their pre-war gold value or
to some lower value nearer to the present facts; in other words, the
choice between _Deflation_ and _Devaluation_.

This assumption is hasty. If we glance at the course of prices during
the last five years, it is obvious that the United States, which has
enjoyed a gold standard throughout, has suffered as severely as many
other countries, that in the United Kingdom the instability of gold has
been a larger factor than the instability of the exchange, that the
same is true even of France, and that in Italy it has been nearly as
large. On the other hand, in India, which has suffered violent exchange
fluctuations, the standard of value, as we shall see below, has been
more stable than in any other country.

We should not, therefore, by fixing the exchanges get rid of our
currency troubles. It is even possible that this step might weaken our
control. The problem of stabilisation has several sides, which we must
consider one by one:

1. Devaluation _versus_ Deflation. Do we wish to fix the standard of
value, whether or not it be gold, near the existing value? Or do we
wish to restore it to the pre-war value?

2. Stability of Prices _versus_ Stability of Exchange. Is it more
important that the value of a national currency should be stable in
terms of purchasing power, or stable in terms of the currency of
certain foreign countries?

3. The Restoration of a Gold Standard. In the light of our answers
to the first two questions, is a gold standard, however imperfect in
theory, the best available method for attaining our ends in practice?

Having decided between these alternative aims, we can proceed, in the
next chapter, to some constructive suggestions.


I. _Devaluation_ versus _Deflation_.

The policy of reducing the ratio between the volume of a country’s
currency and its requirements of purchasing power in the form of money,
so as to increase the exchange value of the currency in terms of gold
or of commodities, is conveniently called _Deflation_.

The alternative policy of stabilising the value of the currency
somewhere near its present value, without regard to its pre-war value,
is called _Devaluation_.

Up to the date of the Genoa Conference of April 1922, these two
policies were not clearly distinguished by the public, and the sharp
opposition between them has been only gradually appreciated. Even now
(October 1923) there is scarcely any European country in which the
authorities have made it clear whether their policy is to stabilise the
value of their currency or to raise it. Stabilisation at the existing
level has been recommended by International Conferences;[40] and the
actual value of many currencies tends to fall rather than to rise. But,
to judge from other indications, the heart’s desire of the State Banks
of Europe, whether they pursue it successfully, as in Czecho-Slovakia,
or unsuccessfully, as in France, is to _raise_ the value of their
currencies. In only one country so far have practical steps been taken
to _fix_ the exchange, namely in Austria.

       [40] Whilst the Conference of Genoa (April 1922) affirmed the
            doctrine in general, representatives of the countries
            chiefly affected were united in declaring that it must
            not be applied to them in particular. Signor Peano, M.
            Picard, and M. Theunis, speaking on behalf of Italy,
            France, and Belgium, announced, each for his own country,
            that they would have nothing to do with devaluating, and
            were determined to restore their respective currencies
            to their pre-war values. Reform is not likely to come by
            joint, simultaneous action. The experts of Genoa recognised
            this when they “ventured to suggest” that “a considerable
            service will be rendered by that country which first
            decides boldly to set the example of securing immediate
            stability in terms of gold” by devaluation.

The simple arguments against Deflation fall under two heads.

In the first place, Deflation is not _desirable_, because it effects,
what is always harmful, a change in the existing Standard of Value,
and redistributes wealth in a manner injurious, at the same time, to
business and to social stability. Deflation, as we have already seen,
involves a transference of wealth from the rest of the community
to the _rentier_ class and to all holders of titles to money; just
as inflation involves the opposite. In particular it involves a
transference from all borrowers, that is to say from traders,
manufacturers, and farmers, to lenders, from the active to the
inactive.

But whilst the oppression of the taxpayer for the enrichment of the
_rentier_ is the chief lasting result, there is another, more violent,
disturbance during the period of transition. The policy of gradually
raising the value of a country’s money to (say) 100 per cent above its
present value in terms of goods--I repeat here the arguments of Chapter
I.--amounts to giving notice to every merchant and every manufacturer,
that for some time to come his stock and his raw materials will
steadily depreciate on his hands, and to every one who finances his
business with borrowed money that he will, sooner or later, lose 100
per cent on his liabilities (since he will have to pay back in terms of
commodities twice as much as he has borrowed). Modern business, being
carried on largely with borrowed money, must necessarily be brought to
a standstill by such a process. It will be to the interest of every one
in business to go out of business for the time being; and of every one
who is contemplating expenditure to postpone his orders so long as he
can. The wise man will be he who turns his assets into cash, withdraws
from the risks and the exertions of activity, and awaits in country
retirement the steady appreciation promised him in the value of his
cash. A probable expectation of Deflation is bad enough; a certain
expectation is disastrous. For the mechanism of the modern business
world is even less adapted to fluctuations in the value of money
upwards than it is to fluctuations downwards.

In the second place, in many countries, Deflation, even were it
desirable, is not _possible_; that is to say, Deflation in sufficient
degree to restore the currency to its pre-war parity. For the burden
which it would throw on the taxpayer would be insupportable. I need
add nothing on this to what I have already written in the second
chapter above. This practical impossibility might have rendered the
policy innocuous, if it were not that, by standing in the way of the
alternative policy, it prolongs the period of uncertainty and severe
seasonal fluctuation, and even, in some cases, can be carried into
effect sufficiently to cause much interference with business. The fact,
that the restoration of their currencies to the pre-war parity is still
the declared official policy of the French and Italian Governments, is
preventing, in those countries, any rational discussion of currency
reform. All those--and in the financial world they are many--who
have reasons for wishing to appear “correct,” are compelled to talk
foolishly. In Italy, where sound economic views have much influence
and which may be nearly ripe for currency reform, Signor Mussolini has
threatened to raise the lira to its former value. Fortunately for the
Italian taxpayer and Italian business, the lira does not listen even to
a dictator and cannot be given castor oil. But such talk can postpone
positive reform; though it may be doubted if so good a politician would
have propounded such a policy, even in bravado and exuberance, if he
had understood that, expressed in other but equivalent words, it was
as follows: “My policy is to halve wages, double the burden of the
National Debt, and to reduce by 50 per cent the prices which Sicily can
get for her exports of oranges and lemons.”

One single country--Czechoslovakia--has made the experiment on a modest
but sufficient scale. Comparatively free from the burden of internal
debt, and free also from serious budgetary deficits, Czechoslovakia was
able in the course of 1922, in pursuance of the policy of her Finance
Minister, Dr. Alois Rasin, to employ the proceeds of certain foreign
loans to improve the exchange value of the Czech crown to nearly three
times the rate which had been touched in the previous year. The policy
has cost her an industrial crisis and serious unemployment. To what
purpose? I do not know. Even now the Czech crown is not worth a sixth
of its pre-war parity; and it remains unstabilised, fluttering before
the breath of the seasons and the wind of politics. Is, therefore, the
process of appreciation to continue indefinitely? If not, when and at
what point is stabilisation to be effected? Czechoslovakia was better
placed than any country in Europe to establish her economic life on the
basis of a sound and fixed currency. Her finances were in equilibrium,
her credit good, her foreign resources adequate, and no one could have
blamed her for devaluating the crown, ruined by no fault of hers and
inherited from the Habsburg Empire. Pursuing a misguided policy in a
spirit of stern virtue, she preferred the stagnation of her industries
and a still fluctuating standard.[41]

       [41] I cannot criticise the work, in his second term of
            office (1922), of Dr. Rasin, now fallen by the hand of
            an assassin, without reference to his great achievement
            during his first term (1919) in rescuing his country’s
            currency from the surrounding chaos. The stamping of the
            Austrian notes and the levy on holders of titles to money
            which accompanied it was the only drastic, courageous, and
            successful measure of finance carried through anywhere in
            Europe at that epoch; the story of it from Dr. Rasin’s
            own pen can be read in his _The Financial Policy of
            Czecho-Slovakia_. Before he had finished other influences
            became dominant. But, when in 1922 this austere and
            disinterested Minister returned to office, he missed, in my
            judgment, his opportunity. He could have completed his task
            by establishing the currency on a fixed and stable basis,
            instead of which he used his great authority to disorder
            trade by a futile process of Deflation.

       *       *       *       *       *

If the restoration of many European currencies to their pre-war parity
with gold is neither desirable nor possible, what are the forces or the
arguments which have established this undesirable impossibility as the
avowed policy of most of them? The following are the most important:

1. _To leave the gold value of a country’s currency at the low level
to which war has driven it is an injustice to the_ rentier _class and
to others whose income is fixed in terms of currency, and practically
a breach of contract; whilst to restore its value would meet a debt of
honour._

The injury done to pre-war holders of fixed interest-bearing stocks is
beyond dispute. Real justice, indeed, might require the restoration
of the purchasing power, and not merely the gold value, of their
money incomes, a measure which no one in fact proposes; whilst nominal
justice has not been infringed, since these investments were not in
gold bullion but in the legal tender of the realm. Nevertheless, if
this class of investors could be dealt with separately, considerations
of equity and the expedience of satisfying reasonable expectation would
furnish a strong case.

But this is not the actual situation. The vast issues of War Loans have
swamped the pre-war holdings of fixed interest-bearing stocks, and
society has largely adjusted itself to the new situation. To restore
the value of pre-war holdings by Deflation means enhancing at the
same time the value of war and post-war holdings, and thereby raising
the total claims of the _rentier_ class not only beyond what they are
entitled to, but to an intolerable proportion of the total income of
the community. Indeed justice, rightly weighed, comes down on the
other side. Much the greater proportion of the money contracts still
outstanding were entered into when money was worth more nearly what
it is worth now than what it was worth in 1913. Thus, in order to do
justice to a minority of creditors, a great injustice would be done to
a great majority of debtors.

This aspect of the matter has been admirably argued by Professor Irving
Fisher.[42] We forget, he says, that not all contracts require the
same adjustment in order to secure justice, and that while we are
debating whether we ought to deflate to secure ideal justice for those
who made contracts on old price levels, new contracts are constantly
being made at the new price levels. An estimate of the volume of
contracts now outstanding, classified according to their age, would
show that some contracts are a day old, some are a month old, some are
a year old, some are a decade old, and some are a century old, the
great mass, however, being of very recent origin. Consequently the
average, or centre of gravity, of the total existing indebtedness is
probably always somewhat near the present. Before the war, Professor
Fisher estimated, very roughly, that contracts in the United States
were on the average about one year old.

       [42] In his article “Devaluation versus Deflation,” published
            in the eleventh _Manchester Guardian_ Reconstruction
            Supplement (Dec. 7, 1922).

When, therefore, the depreciation of the currency has lasted long
enough for society to adjust itself to the new values, Deflation is
even worse than Inflation. Both are “unjust” and disappoint reasonable
expectation. But whereas Inflation, by easing the burden of national
debt and stimulating enterprise, has a little to throw into the other
side of the balance, Deflation has nothing.

2. _The restoration of a currency to its pre-war gold value enhances a
country’s financial prestige and promotes future confidence._

Where a country can hope to restore its pre-war parity at an early
date, this argument cannot be neglected. This might be said of Great
Britain, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, and (perhaps) Spain, but of
no other European country. The argument cannot be extended to those
countries which, even if they could raise somewhat the value of their
legal-tender money, could not possibly restore it to its old value.
It is of the essence of the argument that the _exact_ pre-war parity
should be recovered. It would not make much difference to the financial
prestige of Italy whether she stabilised the lira at 100 to the £
sterling or at 60; and it would be much better for her prestige to
stabilise it definitely at 100 than to let it fluctuate between 60 and
100.

This argument is limited, therefore, to those countries the gold value
of whose currencies is within (say) 5 or 10 per cent of their former
value. Its force in these cases depends, I think, upon what answer
we give to the problem discussed below, namely, whether we intend
to pin ourselves in the future, as in the past, to an unqualified
gold standard. If we still prefer such a standard to any available
alternative, and if future “confidence” in our currency is to depend
not on the stability of its purchasing power but on the fixity of its
gold-value, then it may be worth our while to stand the racket of
Deflation to the extent of 5 or 10 per cent. This view is in accordance
with that expressed by Ricardo in analogous circumstances a hundred
years ago.[43] If, on the other hand, we decide to aim for the future
at stability of the price level rather than at a fixed parity with
gold, in that case _cadit quaestio_.

       [43] See below, p. 153.

In any case this argument does not affect our main conclusion, that
the right policy for countries of which the currency has suffered a
prolonged and severe depreciation is to _devaluate_, and to fix the
value of the currency at that figure in the neighbourhood of the
existing value to which commerce and wages are adjusted.

3. _If the gold value of a country’s currency can be increased,
labour will profit by a reduced cost of living, foreign goods will be
obtainable cheaper, and foreign debts fixed in terms of gold_ (e.g. _to
the United States) will be discharged with less effort._

This argument, which is pure delusion, exercises quite as much
influence as the other two. If the franc is worth more, wages, it is
argued, which are paid in francs, will surely buy more, and French
imports, which are paid for in francs, will be so much cheaper. No!
If francs are worth more they will buy more labour as well as more
goods,--that is to say, wages will fall; and the French exports, which
pay for the imports, will, measured in francs, fall in value just as
much as the imports. Nor will it make in the long run any difference
whatever in the amount of goods the value of which England will have
to transfer to America to pay her dollar debts, whether in the end
sterling settles down at four dollars to the pound, or at its pre-war
parity. The burden of this debt depends on the value of gold, in terms
of which it is fixed, not on the value of sterling. It is not easy, it
seems, for men to apprehend that their money is a mere intermediary,
without significance in itself, which flows from one hand to another,
is received and is dispensed, and disappears when its work is done from
the sum of a nation’s wealth.

       *       *       *       *       *

In concluding this section, let me quote on the issue between Deflation
and Devaluation two classic authorities, Gibbon and Ricardo, the one
to represent the imposing but false wisdom of the would-be upright
statesman, the other to speak in clear tones the voice of instructed
reason.

In the eleventh chapter of _The Decline and Fall_, Gibbon deems
incredible a story of how in A.D. 274 Aurelian’s deflationary zeal to
restore the integrity of the coin excited an insurrection which caused
the death of 7000 soldiers. “We might naturally expect,” he says, “that
the reformation of the coin should have been an action equally popular
with the destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the emperor’s
order were burnt in the forum of Trajan. In an age when the principles
of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most desirable end
might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious means; but a
temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely excite and support
a serious civil war. The repetition of intolerable taxes, imposed
either on the land or on the necessaries of life, may at last provoke
those who will not or who cannot relinquish their country. But the case
is far otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients,
restores the just value of money.”

Rome may have understood the principles of commerce imperfectly in
the third century and not perfectly in the twentieth; but that does
not save her citizens from experiencing their applications. Signor
Mussolini might peruse with interest the annals of Aurelian, who,
“ignorant or impatient of the restraints of civil institutions,”
fell by the hand of an assassin within a year of his deflation of
the currency, “regretted by the army, detested by the Senate, but
universally acknowledged as a warlike and fortunate prince, the useful
though severe reformer of a degenerate State.”

Ricardo, speaking in the House of Commons on the 12th of June 1822,[44]
gave his opinion that: “If in the year 1819 the value of the currency
had stood at 14s. for the pound note, which was the case in the year
1813, he should have thought that, on a balance of all the advantages
and disadvantages of the case, it would have been as well to fix the
currency at the then value, according to which most of the existing
contracts had been made; but when the currency was within 5 per cent of
its par value, he thought they had made the best selection in recurring
to the old standard.”

       [44] The great debate of June 11 and 12, 1822, on Mr. Western’s
            Motion concerning the Resumption of Cash Payments, well
            illustrates, more particularly in the speeches of the
            opener, Mr. Western, and of the opposer, Mr. Huskisson, the
            regularity of the evils which follow a deflationary raising
            of the standard, and the unchanging antithesis between the
            temperaments of deflationists and devaluers, though I doubt
            if any present-day deflationists could make a speech at the
            same time so able and so unfair as Mr. Huskisson’s.

The same is repeated in his _Protection to Agriculture_[45] where he
approves the restoration of the old standard when gold was £4 : 2s. per
standard ounce, but adds that, if it had been £5 : 10s., “no measure
could have been more inexpedient than to make so violent a change in
all subsisting engagements.”

II. _Stability of Prices_ versus _Stability of Exchange_.

Since, subject to the qualification of Chapter III., the rate of
exchange of a country’s currency with the currency of the rest of
the world (assuming for the sake of simplicity that there is only
one external currency) depends on the relation between the internal
price level and the external price level, it follows that the exchange
cannot be stable unless _both_ internal _and_ external price levels
remain stable. If, therefore, the external price level lies outside our
control, we must submit either to our own internal price level or to
our exchange being pulled about by external influences. If the external
price level is unstable, we cannot keep _both_ our own price level
_and_ our exchanges stable. And we are compelled to choose.

In pre-war days, when almost the whole world was on a gold standard,
we had all plumped for stability of exchange as against stability of
prices, and we were ready to submit to the social consequences of a
change of price level for causes quite outside our control, connected,
for example, with the discovery of new gold mines in foreign countries
or a change of banking policy abroad. But we submitted, partly because
we did not dare trust ourselves to a less automatic (though more
reasoned) policy, and partly because the price fluctuations experienced
were in fact moderate. Nevertheless, there were powerful advocates of
the other choice. In particular, the proposals of Professor Irving
Fisher for a Compensated Dollar, amounted, unless all countries adopted
the same plan, to putting into practice a preference for stability of
internal price level over stability of external exchange.

The right choice is not necessarily the same for all countries. It
must partly depend on the relative importance of foreign trade in the
economic life of the country. Nevertheless, there does seem to be in
almost every case a presumption in favour of the stability of prices,
if only it can be achieved. Stability of exchange is in the nature of
a convenience which adds to the efficiency and prosperity of those
who are engaged in foreign trade. Stability of prices, on the other
hand, is profoundly important for the avoidance of the various evils
described in Chapter I. Contracts and business expectations, which
presume a stable exchange, must be far fewer, even in a trading country
such as England, than those which presume a stable level of internal
prices. The main argument to the contrary seems to be that exchange
stability is an easier aim to attain, since it only requires that the
same standard of value should be adopted at home and abroad; whereas an
internal standard, so regulated as to maintain stability in an index
number of prices, is a difficult scientific innovation, never yet put
into practice.

There has been an interesting example recently of a country which,
more perhaps by chance than by design, has secured the advantages
of a relatively stable level of internal prices at the expense of a
fluctuating exchange, namely India. Public attention is so much fixed
on the exchange as the test of the success of a financial policy, that
the Government of India, under severe reproaches for what has happened,
have not defended themselves as effectively as they might. During the
boom of 1919–20, when world prices were soaring, the exchange value of
the rupee was allowed to rise by successive stages, with the result
that the highest level reached by the Indian index number in 1920
exceeded by only 12 per cent the average figure for 1919, whereas for
England the figure was 29 per cent. The Report of the Indian Currency
Committee, on which the Government of India acted somewhat clumsily
without enough allowance for rapidly changing conditions, was avowedly
influenced by the importance in such a country as India, especially in
the political circumstances of that time, of avoiding a violent upward
movement of internal prices. The most just criticism of the Government
of India’s action, in the light of after-events, is that they went too
far in attempting to raise the rupee so high as 2s. 8d.,--a rate not
contemplated by the Currency Committee. Prices outside India never rose
so high as to justify an exchange exceeding 2s. 3d. on the criterion of
keeping Indian prices stable at the 1919 level. On the other hand, when
world prices collapsed, the rupee exchange was allowed to fall with
them, again with the result that the lowest point touched by the Indian
index number in 1921 was only 16 per cent below the highest in 1920,
whereas for England the figure was 50 per cent. The following table
gives the details:

       [46] _Statist._

If the Government of India had been successful in stabilising the
rupee-sterling exchange, they would necessarily have subjected India to
a disastrous price fluctuation comparable to that in England. Thus the
unthinking assumption, in favour of the restoration of a fixed exchange
as the one thing to aim at, requires more examination than it sometimes
receives.

Especially is this the case if the prospect that a majority of
countries will adopt the same standard is still remote. When by
adopting the gold standard we could achieve stability of exchange
with almost the whole world, whilst any other standard would have
appeared as a solitary eccentricity, the solid advantages of certainty
and convenience supported the conservative preference for gold.
Nevertheless, even so, the convenience of traders and the primitive
passion for solid metal might not, I think, have been adequate
to preserve the dynasty of gold, if it had not been for another,
half-accidental circumstance; namely, that for many years past gold had
afforded not only a stable exchange but, on the whole, a stable price
level also. In fact, the choice between stable exchanges and stable
prices had not presented itself as an acute dilemma. And when, prior to
the development of the South African mines, we seemed to be faced with
a continuously falling price level, the fierceness of the bimetallic
controversy testified to the discontent provoked as soon as the
existing standard appeared seriously incompatible with the stability of
prices.

Indeed, it is doubtful whether the pre-war system for regulating the
international flow of gold would have been capable of dealing with such
large or sudden divergencies between the price levels of different
countries as have occurred lately. The fault of the pre-war régime,
under which the rates of exchange between a country and the outside
world were fixed, and the internal price level had to adjust itself
thereto (_i.e._ was chiefly governed by external influences), was that
it was too slow and insensitive in its mode of operation. The fault
of the post-war régime, under which the price level mainly depends on
internal influences (_i.e._ internal currency and credit policy) and
the rates of exchange with the outside world have to adjust themselves
thereto, is that it is too rapid in its effect and over-sensitive, with
the result that it may act violently for merely transitory causes.
Nevertheless, when the fluctuations are large and sudden, a quick
reaction is necessary for the maintenance of equilibrium; and the
necessity for quick reaction has been one of the factors which have
rendered the pre-war method inapplicable to post-war conditions, and
have made every one nervous of proclaiming a final fixation of the
exchange.

We are familiar with the causal chain along which the pre-war method
reached its result. If gold flowed out of the country’s central
reserves, this modified discount policy and the creation of credit,
thus affecting the demand for, and hence the price of, the class of
goods most sensitive to the ease of credit, and gradually, through the
price of these goods, spreading its influence to the prices of goods
generally, including those which enter into international trade, until
at the new level of price foreign goods began to look dear at home and
domestic goods cheap abroad, and the adverse balance was redressed. But
this process might take months to work itself out. Nowadays, the gold
reserves might be dangerously depleted before the compensating forces
had time to operate. Moreover, the movement of the rate of interest
up or down sometimes had more effect in attracting foreign capital
or encouraging investment abroad than in influencing home prices.
Where the disequilibrium was purely seasonal, this was an unqualified
advantage; for it was much better that foreign funds should ebb and
flow between the slack and the busy seasons than that prices should
go up and down. But where it was due to more permanent causes, the
adjustment even before the war might be imperfect; for the stimulus to
foreign loans, whilst restoring the balance for the time being, might
obscure the real seriousness of the situation, and enable a country
to live beyond its resources for a considerable time at the risk of
ultimate default.

Compare with this the instantaneous effects of the post-war method. If
at the existing rate of exchange the amount of sterling offered in the
exchange market during the course of the morning exceeds the amount
of dollars offered, there is no gold available for export at a fixed
price to bridge the gulf. Consequently the dollar rate of exchange must
move until at the new rate the offerings of each of the two currencies
in exchange for one another exactly balance in amount. But it is the
inevitable result of this that within half an hour the relative prices
of commodities entering into English-American trade, such as cotton
and electrolytic copper, have adjusted themselves accordingly. Unless
the American prices move to meet them half-way, the English prices
immediately rise correspondent to the movement of the exchange.

This means that relative prices can be knocked about by the most
fleeting influences of politics and of sentiment, and by the periodic
pressure of seasonal trades. But it also means that the post-war method
is a most rapid and powerful corrective of real disequilibria in the
balance of international payments arising from whatever causes, and
a wonderful preventive in the way of countries which are inclined to
spend abroad beyond their resources.

Thus when there are violent shocks to the pre-existing equilibrium
between the internal and external price-levels, the pre-war method is
likely to break down in practice, simply because it cannot bring about
the re-adjustment of internal prices _quick enough_. Theoretically,
of course, the pre-war method must be able to make itself effective
sooner or later, provided the movement of gold is allowed to continue
without restriction, until the inflation or deflation of prices has
taken place to the necessary extent. But in practice there is usually a
limit to the rate and to the amount by which the actual currency or the
metallic backing for it can be allowed to flow abroad. If the supply of
money or credit is reduced faster than social and business arrangements
allow prices to fall, intolerable inconveniences result. Perhaps some
of the incidents of debasement of the coinage which are sprinkled
through the currency history of the late Middle Ages were really due to
a similar cause. Prior to the discovery of the New World the precious
metals were, over a long period, becoming progressively scarcer in
Europe through natural wastage in the absence of adequate new supplies,
and the drain to the East; with the result that from time to time the
price level in England (for example) would be established on too high a
level in relation to European prices. The resulting tendency of silver
to flow abroad, being accentuated perhaps by some special temporary
cause, would give rise to complaints of a “scarcity of currency,”
which really means an outflow of money faster than social organisation
permits prices to fall. No doubt some of the debasements were helped
by the fact that they profited incidentally a necessitous Exchequer.
But they may have been, nevertheless, the best available expedient
for meeting the currency problem.[47] We shall look on Edward III.’s
debasements of sterling money with a more tolerant eye if we regard
them as a method of carrying into effect a preference for stability
of internal prices over stability of external exchanges, celebrating
that monarch as an enlightened forerunner of Professor Irving Fisher in
advocacy of the “compensated dollar,” only more happy than the latter
in his opportunities to carry theory into practice.

       [47] Cf. Hawtrey, _Currency and Credit_, chap. xvii.

The reader should notice, further, the different parts played by
discount policy under the one régime and under the other. With the
pre-war method discount policy is a vital part of the process for
restoring equilibrium between internal and external prices. With the
post-war method it is not equally indispensable, since the fluctuation
of the exchanges can bring about equilibrium without its aid;--though
it remains, of course, as an instrument for influencing the internal
price level and through this the exchanges, if we desire to establish
either the one or the other at a different level from that which would
have prevailed otherwise.


III. _The Restoration of a Gold Standard._

Our conclusions up to this point are, therefore, that, when stability
of the internal price level and stability of the external exchanges
are incompatible, the former is generally preferable; and that on
occasions when the dilemma is acute, the preservation of the former at
the expense of the latter is, fortunately perhaps, the line of least
resistance.

The restoration of the gold standard (whether at the pre-war parity or
at some other rate) certainly will not give us complete stability of
internal prices and can only give us complete stability of the external
exchanges if all other countries also restore the gold standard. The
advisability of restoring it depends, therefore, on whether, on the
whole, it will give us the best working compromise obtainable between
the two ideals.

The advocates of gold, as against a more scientific standard, base
their cause on the double contention, that in practice gold has
provided and will provide a reasonably stable standard of value, and
that in practice, since governing authorities lack wisdom as often
as not, a managed currency will, sooner or later, come to grief.
Conservatism and scepticism join arms--as they often do. Perhaps
superstition comes in too; for gold still enjoys the prestige of its
smell and colour.

The considerable success with which gold maintained its stability of
value in the changing world of the nineteenth century was certainly
remarkable. I have applauded it in the first chapter. After the
discoveries of Australia and California it began to depreciate
dangerously, and before the exploitation of South Africa it began to
appreciate dangerously. Yet in each case it righted itself and retained
its reputation.

But the conditions of the future are not those of the past. We have
no sufficient ground for expecting the continuance of the special
conditions which preserved a sort of balance before the war. For what
are the underlying explanations of the good behaviour of gold during
the nineteenth century?

In the first place, it happened that progress in the discovery of
gold mines roughly kept pace with progress in other directions--a
correspondence which was not altogether a matter of chance, because
the progress of that period, since it was characterised by the gradual
opening up and exploitation of the world’s surface, not unnaturally
brought to light _pari passu_ the remoter deposits of gold. But this
stage of history is now almost at an end. A quarter of a century
has passed by since the discovery of an important deposit. Material
progress is more dependent now on the growth of scientific and
technical knowledge, of which the application to gold-mining may be
intermittent. Years may elapse without great improvement in the methods
of extracting gold; and then the genius of a chemist may realise past
dreams and forgotten hoaxes, transmuting base into precious like
Subtle, or extracting gold from sea-water as in the Bubble. Gold is
liable to be either too dear or too cheap. In either case, it is too
much to expect that a succession of accidents will keep the metal
steady.

But there was another type of influence which used to aid stability.
The value of gold has not depended on the policy or the decisions of
a single body of men; and a sufficient proportion of the supply has
been able to find its way, without any flooding of the market, into the
Arts or into the hoards of Asia for its marginal value to be governed
by a steady psychological estimation of the metal in relation to other
things. This is what is meant by saying that gold has “intrinsic value”
and is free from the dangers of a “managed” currency. The _independent
variety_ of the influences determining the value of gold has been in
itself a steadying influence. The arbitrary and variable character
of the proportion of gold reserves to liabilities maintained by many
of the note-issuing banks of the world, so far from introducing an
incalculable factor, was an element of stability. For when gold was
relatively abundant and flowed towards them, it was absorbed by their
allowing their ratio of gold reserves to rise slightly; and when it
was relatively scarce, the fact that they had no intention of ever
utilising their gold reserves for any practical purpose, permitted
most of them to view with equanimity a moderate weakening of their
proportion. A great part of the flow of South African gold between the
end of the Boer War and 1914 was able to find its way into the central
gold reserves of European and other countries with the minimum effect
on prices.

But the war has effected a great change. Gold itself has become a
“managed” currency. The West, as well as the East, has learnt to hoard
gold; but the motives of the United States are not those of India.
Now that most countries have abandoned the gold standard, the supply
of the metal would, if the chief user of it restricted its holdings
to its real needs, prove largely redundant. The United States has not
been able to let gold fall to its “natural” value, because it could
not face the resulting depreciation of its standard. It has been
driven, therefore, to the costly policy of burying in the vaults of
Washington what the miners of the Rand have laboriously brought to the
surface. Consequently gold now stands at an “artificial” value, the
future course of which almost entirely depends on the policy of the
Federal Reserve Board of the United States. The value of gold is no
longer the resultant of the chance gifts of Nature and the judgment
of numerous authorities and individuals acting independently. Even if
other countries gradually return to a gold basis, the position will
not be greatly changed. The tendency to employ some variant of the
gold-exchange standard and the probably permanent disappearance of gold
from the pockets of the people are likely to mean that the strictly
_necessary_ gold reserves of the Central Banks of the gold-standard
countries will fall considerably short of the available supplies. The
actual value of gold will depend, therefore, on the policy of three or
four of the most powerful Central Banks, whether they act independently
or in unison. If, on the other hand, pre-war conventions about the use
of gold in reserves and in circulation were to be restored--which is,
in my opinion, the much less probable alternative--there might be, as
Professor Cassel has predicted, a serious shortage of gold leading to a
progressive appreciation in its value.

Nor must we neglect the possibility of a partial demonetisation of gold
by the United States through a closing of its mints to further receipts
of gold. The present policy of the United States in accepting unlimited
imports of gold can be justified, perhaps, as a temporary measure,
intended to preserve tradition and to strengthen confidence through
a transitional period. But, looked at as a permanent arrangement, it
could hardly be judged otherwise than as a foolish expense. If the
Federal Reserve Board intends to maintain the value of the dollar at
a level which is irrespective of the inflow or outflow of gold, what
object is there in continuing to accept at the mints gold which is not
wanted, yet costs a heavy price? If the United States mints were to be
closed to gold, everything, except the actual price of the metal, could
continue precisely as before.

Confidence in the future stability of the value of gold depends
therefore on the United States being foolish enough to go on accepting
gold which it does not want, and wise enough, having accepted it, to
maintain it at a fixed value. This double event might be realised
through the collaboration of a public understanding nothing with a
Federal Reserve Board understanding everything. But the position is
precarious; and not very attractive to any country which is still in a
position to choose what its future standard is to be.

This discussion of the prospects of the stability of gold has partly
answered by anticipation the second principal argument in favour of the
restoration of an unqualified gold standard, namely that this is the
only way of avoiding the dangers of a “managed” currency.

It is natural, after what we have experienced, that prudent people
should desiderate a standard of value which is independent of Finance
Ministers and State Banks. The present state of affairs has allowed
to the ignorance and frivolity of statesmen an ample opportunity of
bringing about ruinous consequences in the economic field. It is felt
that the general level of economic and financial education amongst
statesmen and bankers is hardly such as to render innovations feasible
or safe; that, in fact, a chief object of stabilising the exchanges is
to strap down Ministers of Finance.

These are reasonable grounds of hesitation. But the experience on which
they are based is by no means fair to the capacities of statesmen and
bankers. The non-metallic standards, of which we have experience, have
been anything rather than scientific experiments coolly carried out.
They have been a last resort, involuntarily adopted, as a result of war
or inflationary taxation, when the State finances were already broken
or the situation out of hand. Naturally in these circumstances such
practices have been the accompaniment and the prelude of disaster. But
we cannot argue from this to what can be achieved in normal times. I
do not see that the regulation of the standard of value is essentially
more difficult than many other objects of less social necessity which
we attain successfully.

If, indeed, a providence watched over gold, or if Nature had provided
us with a stable standard ready-made, I would not, in an attempt after
some slight improvement, hand over the management to the possible
weakness or ignorance of Boards and Governments. But this is not the
situation. We have no ready-made standard. Experience has shown that
in emergencies Ministers of Finance cannot be strapped down. And--most
important of all--in the modern world of paper currency and bank credit
there is no escape from a “managed” currency, whether we wish it or
not;--convertibility into gold will not alter the fact that the value
of gold itself depends on the policy of the Central Banks.

It is worth while to pause a moment over the last sentence. It differs
significantly from the doctrine of gold reserves which we learnt and
taught before the war. We used to assume that no Central Bank would be
so extravagant as to keep more gold than it required or so imprudent
as to keep less. From time to time gold would flow out into the
circulation or for export abroad; experience showed that the quantity
required on these occasions bore some rough proportion to the Central
Bank’s liabilities; a decidedly higher proportion than this would be
fixed on to provide for contingencies and to inspire confidence; and
the creation of credit would be regulated largely by reference to the
maintenance of this proportion. The Bank of England, for example,
would allow itself to be swayed by the tides of gold, permitting
the inflowing and outflowing streams to produce their “natural”
consequences unchecked by any ideas as to preventing the effect on
prices. Already before the war, the system was becoming precarious by
reason of its artificiality. The “proportion” was by the lapse of time
losing its relation to the facts and had become largely conventional.
Some other figure, greater or less, would have done just as well.[48]
The War broke down the convention; for the withdrawal of gold from
actual circulation destroyed one of the elements of reality lying
behind the convention, and the suspension of convertibility destroyed
the other. It would have been absurd to regulate the bank rate by
reference to a “proportion” which had lost all its significance; and
in the course of the past ten years a new policy has been evolved. The
bank rate is now employed, however incompletely and experimentally,
to regulate the expansion and deflation of credit in the interests of
business stability and the steadiness of prices. In so far as it is
employed to procure stability of the dollar exchange, where this is
inconsistent with stability of internal prices, we have a relic of
pre-war policy and a compromise between discrepant aims.

       [48] _Vide_, for what I wrote about this in 1914, _The Economic
            Journal_, xxiv. p. 621.

Those who advocate the return to a gold standard do not always
appreciate along what different lines our actual practice has been
drifting. If we restore the gold standard, are we to return also to the
pre-war conceptions of bank-rate, allowing the tides of gold to play
what tricks they like with the internal price-level, and abandoning the
attempt to moderate the disastrous influence of the credit-cycle on the
stability of prices and employment? Or are we to continue and develop
the experimental innovations of our present policy, ignoring the “bank
ratio” and, if necessary, allowing unmoved a piling up of gold reserves
far beyond our requirements or their depletion far below them?

In truth, the gold standard is already a barbarous relic. All of us,
from the Governor of the Bank of England downwards, are now primarily
interested in preserving the stability of business, prices, and
employment, and are not likely, when the choice is forced on us,
deliberately to sacrifice these to the out-worn dogma, which had its
value once, of £3 : 17 : 10½ per ounce. Advocates of the ancient
standard do not observe how remote it now is from the spirit and the
requirements of the age. A regulated non-metallic standard has slipped
in unnoticed. _It exists._ Whilst the economists dozed, the academic
dream of a hundred years, doffing its cap and gown, clad in paper rags,
has crept into the real world by means of the bad fairies--always so
much more potent than the good--the wicked Ministers of Finance.

For these reasons enlightened advocates of the restoration of gold,
such as Mr. Hawtrey, do not welcome it as the return of a “natural”
currency, and intend, quite decidedly, that it shall be a “managed”
one. They allow gold back only as a constitutional monarch, shorn of
his ancient despotic powers and compelled to accept the advice of a
Parliament of Banks. The adoption of the ideas present in the minds of
those who drafted the Genoa Resolutions on Currency is an essential
condition of Mr. Hawtrey’s adherence to gold. He contemplates “the
practice of continuous co-operation among central banks of issue” (Res.
3), and an international convention, based on a gold exchange standard,
and designed “with a view to preventing undue fluctuations in the
purchasing power of gold” (Res. 11).[49] But he is _not_ in favour of
resuming the gold standard irrespective of “whether the difficulties
in regard to the future purchasing power of gold have been provided
against or not.” “It is not easy,” he admits, “to promote international
action, and should it fail, the wisest course for the time being
might be to concentrate on the stabilisation of sterling in terms of
commodities, rather than tie the pound to a metal, the vagaries of
which cannot be foreseen.”[50]

       [49] _Monetary Reconstruction_, p. 132.

       [50] _Loc. cit._ p. 22.

It is natural to ask, in face of advocacy of this kind, why it is
necessary to drag in gold at all. Mr. Hawtrey lays no stress on the
obvious support for his compromise, namely the force of sentiment and
tradition, and the preference of Englishmen for shearing a monarch of
his powers rather than of his head. But he adduces three other reasons:
(1) that gold is required as a liquid reserve for the settlement
of international balances of indebtedness; (2) that it enables an
experiment to be made without cutting adrift from the old system; and
(3) that the vested interests of gold producers must be considered.
These objects, however, are so largely attained by my own suggestions
in the following chapter, that I need not dwell on them here.

On the other hand, I see grave objections to reinstating gold in the
pious hope that international co-operation will keep it in order. With
the existing distribution of the world’s gold, the reinstatement of
the gold standard means, inevitably, that we surrender the regulation
of our price level and the handling of the credit cycle to the Federal
Reserve Board of the United States. Even if the most intimate and
cordial co-operation is established between the Board and the Bank of
England, the preponderance of power will still belong to the former.
The Board will be in a position to disregard the Bank. But if the Bank
disregard the Board, it will render itself liable to be flooded with,
or depleted of, gold, as the case may be. Moreover, we can be confident
beforehand that there will be much suspicion amongst Americans (for
that is their disposition) of any supposed attempt on the part of
the Bank of England to dictate their policy or to influence American
discount rates in the interests of Great Britain. We must also be
prepared to incur our share of the vain expense of bottling up the
world’s redundant gold.

It would be rash in present circumstances to surrender our freedom of
action to the Federal Reserve Board of the United States. We do not
yet possess sufficient experience of its capacity to act in times of
stress with courage and independence. The Federal Reserve Board is
striving to free itself from the pressure of sectional interests; but
we are not yet certain that it will wholly succeed. It is still liable
to be overwhelmed by the impetuosity of a cheap money campaign. A
suspicion of British influence would, so far from strengthening the
Board, greatly weaken its resistance to popular clamour. Nor is it
certain, quite apart from weakness or mistakes, that the simultaneous
application of the same policy will always be in the interests of
both countries. The development of the credit cycle and the state of
business may sometimes be widely different on the two sides of the
Atlantic.

Therefore, since I regard the stability of prices, credit, and
employment as of paramount importance, and since I feel no confidence
that an old-fashioned gold standard will even give us the modicum of
stability that it used to give, I reject the policy of restoring the
gold standard on pre-war lines. At the same time I doubt the wisdom of
attempting a “managed” gold standard jointly with the United States, on
the lines recommended by Mr. Hawtrey, because it retains too many of
the disadvantages of the old system without its advantages, and because
it would make us too dependent on the policy and on the wishes of the
Federal Reserve Board.




CHAPTER V

POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE REGULATION OF MONEY


A sound constructive scheme must provide--if it is to satisfy the
arguments and the analysis of this book:

I. A method for regulating the supply of currency and credit with a
view to maintaining, so far as possible, the stability of the internal
price level; and

II. A method for regulating the supply of foreign exchange so as to
avoid purely temporary fluctuations, caused by seasonal or other
influences and not due to a lasting disturbance in the relation between
the internal and the external price level.

I believe that in Great Britain the ideal system can be most nearly
and most easily reached by an adaptation of the actual system which
has grown up, half haphazard, since the war. After the general idea
has been exhibited by an application in detail to the case of Great
Britain, it will be sufficient to deal somewhat briefly with the
modifications required in the case of other countries.


I. _Great Britain._

The system actually in operation to-day is broadly as follows:

(1) The internal price level is mainly determined by the amount
of credit created by the banks, chiefly the Big Five; though in a
depression, when the public are increasing their real balances, a
greater amount of credit has to be created to support a given price
level (in accordance with the theory explained above in Chapter III.,
p. 84) than is required in a boom, when real balances are being
diminished.

The amount of credit, so created, is in its turn roughly measured by
the volume of the banks’ deposits--since variations in this total
must correspond to variations in the total of their investments,
bill-holdings, and advances. Now there is no necessary reason _a
priori_ why the proportion between the banks’ deposits and their
“cash in hand and at the Bank of England” should not fluctuate within
fairly wide limits in accordance with circumstances. But in practice
the banks usually work by rule of thumb and do not depart widely from
their preconceived “proportions.”[51] In recent times their aggregate
deposits have always been about nine times their “cash.” Since this
is what is generally considered a “safe” proportion, it is bad for a
bank’s reputation to fall below it, whilst on the other hand it is bad
for its earning power to rise above it. Thus in one way or another
the banks generally adjust their total creation of credit in one form
or another (investments, bills, and advances) up to their capacity as
measured by the above criterion; from which it follows that the volume
of their “cash” in the shape of Bank and Currency Notes and Deposits at
the Bank of England closely determines the volume of credit which they
create.

       [51] The Joint Stock banks have published monthly returns
            since January 1921. Excluding the half-yearly statement
            when a little “window-dressing” is temporarily arranged,
            the extreme range of fluctuation has been between 11·0
            per cent and 11·9 per cent in the proportion of “cash”
            to deposits, and between 41·1 per cent and 50·1 per cent
            in the proportion of advances to deposits. These figures
            cover two and a half years of widely varying conditions.
            The “proportions” of individual banks differ amongst
            themselves, and the above is an average result, the
            steadiness of which is strengthened by the fact that each
            big bank is pretty steadfast in its own policy.

In order to follow, therefore, the train of causation a stage further,
we must consider what determines the volume of their “cash.” Its amount
can only be altered in one or other of three ways: (_a_) by the public
requiring more or fewer notes in circulation, (_b_) by the Treasury
borrowing more or less from the Currency Note Reserve, and (_c_) by the
Bank of England increasing or diminishing its assets.[52]

       [52] For the aggregate of its liabilities in the shape of
            deposits and of notes in circulation automatically depends
            on the volume of its assets.

To complete the argument, one further factor, not yet mentioned, must
be introduced, namely (_d_) the proportion of the banks’ second-line
reserve in the shape of their holdings of Treasury Bills, which
can be regarded as cash at one remove. In determining what is a
safe proportion of “cash,” they pay some regard to the amount of
Treasury Bills which they hold, since by reducing this holding they
can immediately increase their “cash” and compel the Treasury to
borrow more either from the Currency Note Reserve or from the Bank of
England. The ninefold proportion referred to above presumes a certain
minimum holding of Treasury Bills, and might have to be modified if a
sufficient volume of such Bills was not available. This factor (_d_)
is, however, also important because the banks in their turn are open to
pressure by the Treasury, whenever it draws to itself the resources of
their depositors--whether by taxation or by offering them attractive
longer-dated loans--and uses them to pay off, if not Ways and Means
advances from the Bank of England (which reduces the banks’ first-line
reserve of cash), then alternatively Treasury Bills held by the banks
themselves (which reduces their second-line reserve of bills).

Items (_a_), (_b_), (_c_), and (_d_) together, therefore, more or less
settle the matter. For the purpose of the present argument, however, we
need not pay much separate attention to (_a_) and (_b_), since their
effect is, for the most part, reflected over again in (_c_) and (_d_).
(_a_) depends partly on the volume of trade but mainly on the price
level itself; and in practice fluctuations in (_a_) do not _directly_
affect the banks’ “cash,”--for if more notes are required under
(_a_), more notes are issued, the Treasury borrowing a corresponding
additional amount from the Currency Note Reserve, in which case the
Treasury either repays the Bank of England, which diminishes the Bank’s
assets and consequently the other banks’ “cash,” or withdraws an
equivalent amount of Treasury Bills, which diminishes the other banks’
second-line reserve; _i.e._ a change in (_a_) operates on the banks’
resources through (_c_) and (_d_).[53] Whilst as for (_b_), a change in
the amount of what the Treasury borrows from the Currency Note Reserve
is reflected by a corresponding change in the opposite sense in what it
borrows in Ways and Means Advances or in Treasury Bills.

       [53] If the additional issue of notes is covered by transferring
            gold from the Bank of England, this is merely an
            alternative way of diminishing the Bank of England’s assets.

Thus we can concentrate our attention on (_c_) and (_d_) as the main
determining factors of the price level.

Now (_c_), namely the assets of the Bank of England, consist (so far as
their variable part is concerned) of

(i.) Ways and Means advances to the Treasury.

(ii.) Gilt-edged and other investments.

(iii.) Advances to its customers and bills of exchange.

(iv.) Gold.

An increase in any of these items tends, therefore, to increase the
other banks’ “cash,” thereby to stimulate the creation of credit, and
hence to raise the price level; and contrariwise.

And (_d_), namely the banks’ holdings of Treasury Bills, depend on
the excess of the expenditure of the Treasury over and above what it
secures (i.) from the public by taxation and loans, (ii.) from the Bank
of England in Ways and Means advances, and (iii.) by borrowing from the
Currency Note Reserve.

It follows that the capacity of the Joint Stock banks to create credit
is mainly governed by the policies and actions of the Bank of England
and of the Treasury. When these are settled, (_a_), (_b_), (_c_), and
(_d_) are settled.

How far can these two authorities control their own actions and how
far must they remain passive agents? In my opinion the control, if
they choose to exercise it, is mainly in their own hands. As regards
the Treasury, the extent to which they draw money from the public to
discharge floating debt clearly depends on the rate of interest and
the type of loan which they are prepared to offer. A point might be
reached when they could not fund further on any reasonable terms; but
within fairly wide limits the policy of the Treasury can be whatever
the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the House of Commons may decide.
The Bank of England also is, within sufficiently wide limits, mistress
of the situation if she acts in conjunction with the Treasury. She can
increase or decrease at will her investments and her gold by buying or
selling the one or the other. In the case of advances and of bills,
whilst their volume is not so immediately or directly controllable,
here also adequate control can be obtained by varying the price
charged, that is to say the bank rate.[54]

       [54] It is often assumed that the bank rate is the _sole_
            governing factor. But the bank rate can only operate by its
            reaction on (_c_), namely, the Bank of England’s assets.
            Formerly it acted pretty directly on two of the components
            of (_c_), namely, (_c_) (iii.) advances to customers and
            bills of exchange and (_c_) (iv.) gold. Now it acts only
            on one of them, namely, (_c_) (iii.). But changes in (_c_)
            (i.) the Bank’s advances to the Treasury and (_c_) (ii.)
            the Bank’s investments can often be nearly as potent in
            their effect on the creation of credit. Thus a low bank
            rate can be largely neutralised by a simultaneous reduction
            of (_c_) (i.) or (_c_) (ii.) and a high bank rate by an
            increase of these. Indeed the Bank of England can probably
            bring the money-market to heel more decisively by buying or
            selling securities than in any other way; and the utility
            of bank rate, operated by itself and without assistance
            from deliberate variations in the volume of (_c_) (ii.), is
            lessened by the various limitations which exist in practice
            to its freedom of movement, and to the limits within which
            it can move, upwards and downwards.

Therefore it is broadly true to say that the level of prices, and
hence the level of the exchanges, depends in the last resort on the
policy of the Bank of England and of the Treasury in respect of the
above particulars;--though the other banks, if they strongly opposed
the official policy, could thwart, or at least delay it to a certain
extent--provided they were prepared to depart from their usual
proportions.

(2) Cash, in the form of Bank or Currency Notes, is supplied _ad
libitum_, _i.e._ in such quantities as are called for by the amount of
credit created and the internal price level established under (1). That
is to say, in practice;--in theory, a limit to the issue of Currency
Notes has been laid down, namely the maximum fiduciary issue actually
attained in the preceding calendar year. Since this theoretical
maximum was prescribed, it has never yet been actually operative;
and, as the rule springs from a doctrine now out of date and out of
accordance with most responsible opinion, it is probable that, if it
were becoming operative, it would be relaxed. This is a matter where
the recommendations of the Cunliffe Committee call for urgent change,
unless we desire deliberately to pursue still further a process of
Deflation. A point must come when, a year of brisk trade and employment
following one of depression, there will be an increased demand for
currency, which must be met unless the revival is to be deliberately
damped down.

Thus the tendency of to-day--rightly I think--is to watch and to
control the creation of credit and to let the creation of currency
follow suit, rather than, as formerly, to watch and to control the
creation of currency and to let the creation of credit follow suit.

(3) The Bank of England’s gold is immobilised. It neither buys nor
sells. The gold plays no part in our system. Occasionally, however, the
Bank may ship a consignment to the United States, to help the Treasury
in meeting its dollar liabilities. The South African and other gold
which finds its way here comes purely as a commodity to a convenient
_entrepôt_ centre, and is mostly re-exported.

(4) The foreign exchanges are unregulated and left to look after
themselves. From day to day they fluctuate in accordance with the
seasons and other irregular influences. Over longer periods they
depend, as we have seen, on the relative price levels established here
and abroad by the respective credit policies adopted here and abroad.
But whilst this is, for the most part, the actual state of affairs,
it is not, as yet, the avowed or consistent policy of the responsible
authorities. Fixity of the dollar exchange at the pre-war parity
remains their aspiration; and it still may happen that the bank rate
is raised for the purpose of influencing the exchange at a time when
considerations of internal price level and credit policy point the
other way.

       *       *       *       *       *

This, in brief--I apologise to the reader if I have compressed the
argument unduly--is the present state of affairs, one essentially
different from our pre-war system. It will be observed that in practice
we have already gone a long way towards the ideal of directing bank
rate and credit policy by reference to the internal price level and
other symptoms of under- or over-expansion of internal credit, rather
than by reference to the pre-war criteria of the amount of cash in
circulation (or of gold reserves in the banks) or the level of the
dollar exchange.

I. Accordingly my first requirement in a good constructive scheme can
be supplied merely by a development of our existing arrangements on
more deliberate and self-conscious lines. Hitherto the Treasury and
the Bank of England have looked forward to the stability of the dollar
exchange (preferably at the pre-war parity) as their objective. It
is not clear whether they intend to stick to this irrespective of
fluctuations in the value of the dollar (or of gold); whether, that
is to say, they would sacrifice the stability of sterling prices to
the stability of the dollar exchange in the event of the two proving
to be incompatible. At any rate, my scheme would require that they
should adopt the stability of sterling prices as their _primary_
objective--though this would not prevent their aiming at exchange
stability also as a secondary objective by co-operating with the
Federal Reserve Board in a common policy. So long as the Federal
Reserve Board was successful in keeping dollar prices steady the
objective of keeping sterling prices steady would be identical with
the objective of keeping the dollar sterling exchange steady. My
recommendation does not involve more than a determination that, in
the event of the Federal Reserve Board failing to keep dollar prices
steady, sterling prices should not, if it could be helped, plunge with
them merely for the sake of maintaining a fixed parity of exchange.

If the Bank of England, the Treasury, and the Big Five were to
adopt this policy, to what criteria should they look respectively
in regulating bank-rate, Government borrowing, and trade-advances?
The first question is whether the criterion should be a precise,
arithmetical formula or whether it should be sought in a general
judgement of the situation based on all the available data. The
pioneer of price-stability as against exchange-stability, Professor
Irving Fisher, advocated the former in the shape of his “compensated
dollar,” which was to be automatically adjusted by reference to an
index number of prices without any play of judgement or discretion.
He may have been influenced, however, by the advantage of propounding
a method which could be grafted as easily as possible on to the
pre-war system of gold-reserves and gold-ratios. In any case, I doubt
the wisdom and the practicability of a system so cut and dried. If
we wait until a price movement is actually afoot before applying
remedial measures, we may be too late. “It is not the _past_ rise in
prices but the _future_ rise that has to be counteracted.”[55] It
is characteristic of the impetuosity of the credit cycle that price
movements tend to be cumulative, each movement promoting, up to a
certain point, a further movement in the same direction. Professor
Fisher’s method may be adapted to deal with long-period trends in the
value of gold but not with the, often more injurious, short-period
oscillations of the credit cycle. Nevertheless, whilst it would
not be advisable to postpone action until it was called for by an
actual movement of prices, it would promote confidence and furnish an
objective standard of value, if, an official index number having been
compiled of such a character as to register the price of a standard
composite commodity, the authorities were to adopt this composite
commodity as their standard of value in the sense that they would
employ all their resources to prevent a movement of its price by more
than a certain percentage in either direction away from the normal,
just as before the war they employed all their resources to prevent
a movement in the price of gold by more than a certain percentage.
The precise composition of the standard composite commodity could be
modified from time to time in accordance with changes in the relative
economic importance of its various components.

       [55] Hawtrey, _Monetary Reconstruction_, p. 105.

As regards the criteria, other than the actual trend of prices, which
should determine the action of the controlling authority, it is beyond
the scope of this volume to deal adequately with the diagnosis and
analysis of the credit cycle. The more deeply that our researches
penetrate into this subject, the more accurately shall we understand
the right time and method for controlling credit-expansion by bank-rate
or otherwise. But in the meantime we have a considerable and growing
body of general experience upon which those in authority can base their
judgements. Actual price-movements must of course provide the most
important datum; but the state of employment, the volume of production,
the effective demand for credit as felt by the banks, the rate of
interest on investments of various types, the volume of new issues,
the flow of cash into circulation, the statistics of foreign trade and
the level of the exchanges must all be taken into account. The main
point is that the _objective_ of the authorities, pursued with such
means as are at their command, should be the stability of prices.

It would at least be possible to avoid, for example, such action
as has been taken lately (in Great Britain) whereby the supply of
“cash” has been deflated at a time when real balances were becoming
inflated,--action which has materially aggravated the severity of
the late depression. We might be able to moderate very greatly the
amplitude of the fluctuations if it was understood that the time to
deflate the supply of cash is when real balances are falling, _i.e._
when prices are rising out of proportion to the increase, if any, in
the volume of cash, and that the time to inflate the supply of cash
is when real balances are rising, and not, as seems to be our present
practice, the other way round.

II. How can we best combine this primary object with a maximum
stability of the exchanges? Can we get the best of both
worlds--stability of prices over long periods and stability of
exchanges over short periods? It is the great advantage of the gold
standard that it overcomes the excessive sensitiveness of the exchanges
to temporary influences, which we analysed in Chapter III. Our object
must be to secure this advantage, if we can, without committing
ourselves to follow big movements in the value of gold itself.

I believe that we can go a long way in this direction if the Bank
of England will take over the duty of regulating the price of gold,
just as it already regulates the rate of discount. “Regulate,” but
not “peg.” The Bank of England should have a buying and a selling
price for gold, just as it did before the war, and this price might
remain unchanged for considerable periods, just as bank-rate does.
But it would not be fixed or “pegged” once and for all, any more than
bank-rate is fixed. The Bank’s rate for gold would be announced every
Thursday morning at the same time as its rate for discounting bills,
with a difference between its buying and selling rates corresponding to
the pre-war margin between £3 : 17 : 10½ per oz. and £3 : 17 : 9 per
oz.; except that, in order to obviate too frequent changes in the rate,
the difference might be wider than 1½d. per oz.--say, ½ to 1 per cent.
A willingness on the part of the Bank both to buy and to sell gold at
rates fixed for the time being would keep the dollar-sterling exchange
steady within corresponding limits, so that the exchange rate would
not move with every breath of wind but only when the Bank had come to
a considered judgement that a change was required for the sake of the
stability of sterling prices.

If the bank rate and the gold rate in conjunction were leading to an
excessive influx or an excessive efflux of gold, the Bank of England
would have to decide whether the flow was due to an internal or to an
external movement away from stability. To fix our ideas, let us suppose
that gold is flowing outwards. If this seemed to be due to a tendency
of sterling to depreciate in terms of commodities, the correct remedy
would be to raise the bank rate. If, on the other hand, it was due to
a tendency of gold to appreciate in terms of commodities, the correct
remedy would be to raise the gold rate (_i.e._ the buying price for
gold). If, however, the flow could be explained by seasonal, or other
passing influences, then it should be allowed to continue (assuming,
of course, that the Bank’s gold reserves were equal to any probable
calls on them) unchecked, to be redressed later on by the corresponding
reaction.

Two subsidiary suggestions may be made for strengthening the Bank’s
control:

(1) The service of the American debt will make it necessary for the
British Treasury to buy nearly $500,000 every working day. It is clear
that the particular method adopted for purchasing these huge sums will
greatly affect the short-period fluctuations of the exchange. I suggest
that this duty should be entrusted to the Bank of England to be carried
out by them with the express object of minimising those fluctuations
in the exchange which are due to the daily and seasonal ebb and flow
of the ordinary trade demand. In particular the proper distribution
of these purchases through the year might be so arranged as greatly to
mitigate the normal seasonal fluctuation discussed in Chapter III. If
the trade demand is concentrated in one half of the year the Treasury
demand should be concentrated in the other half.

(2) It would effect an improvement in the technique of the system here
proposed, without altering its fundamental characteristics, if the
Bank of England were to quote a daily price, not only for the purchase
and sale of gold for immediate delivery, but also for delivery three
months forward. The difference, if any, between the cash and forward
quotations might represent either a discount or a premium of the latter
on the former, according as the bank desired money rates in London to
stand below or above those in New York. The existence of the forward
quotation of the Bank of England would afford a firm foundation for
a free market in forward exchange, and would facilitate the movement
of funds between London and New York for short periods, in much the
same way as before the war, whilst at the same time keeping down to a
minimum the actual movement of gold bullion backwards and forwards. I
need not develop this point further, because it is only an application
of the argument of Section III. of Chapter III. which will be most
readily intelligible to the reader, if he will refer back to the
previous argument.

There remains the question of the regulation of the Note Issue. My
proposal here may appear shocking until the reader realises that,
apart from its disregarding the conventions, it does not differ in
substance from the existing state of affairs. The object of fixing
the amount of gold to be held against a note issue is to set up a
danger signal which cannot be easily disregarded, when a curtailment
of credit and purchasing power is urgently required to maintain the
legal tender money at its lawful parity. But this system, whilst far
better than no system at all, is primitive in its ideas and is, in
fact, a survival of an earlier evolutionary stage in the development
of credit and currency. For it has two great disadvantages. In so far
as we fix a minimum gold reserve against the note issue, the effect
is to immobilise this quantity of gold and thus to reduce the amount
actually available for use as a store of value to meet temporary or
sudden deficits in the country’s international balance of payments.
And in so far as we regard an approach towards the prescribed minimum
or a departure upwards from it as a barometer warning us to curtail
credit or encouraging us to expand it, we are using a criterion which
most people would now agree in considering second-rate for the purpose,
because it cannot give the necessary warning _soon enough_. If gold
movements are actually taking place, this means that the disequilibrium
has proceeded a very long way; and whilst this criterion may pull us
up in time to preserve convertibility on the one hand or to prevent
an excessive flood of gold on the other, it will not do so in time to
avoid an injurious oscillation of prices. This method belongs indeed to
a period when the preservation of convertibility was all that any one
thought about (all indeed that there was to think about so long as we
were confined to an unregulated gold standard), and before the idea of
utilising bank-rate as a means of keeping prices and employment steady
had become practical politics.

We have scarcely realised how far our thoughts have travelled during
the past five years. But to re-read the famous Cunliffe Report on
Currency and Foreign Exchange after the War, published in 1918, brings
vividly before one’s mind what a great distance we have covered since
then. This document was published three months before the Armistice.
It was compiled long before the unpegging of sterling and the great
break in the European exchanges in 1919, before the tremendous boom
and crash of 1920–21, before the vast piling up of the world’s gold
in America, and without experience of the Federal Reserve policy
in 1922–23 of burying this gold at Washington, withdrawing it from
the exercise of its full effect on prices, and thereby, in effect,
demonetising the metal. The Cunliffe Report is an unadulterated pre-war
prescription--inevitably so considering that it was written after four
years’ interregnum of war, before Peace was in sight, and without
knowledge of the revolutionary and unforeseeable experiences of the
past five years.

Of all the omissions from the Cunliffe Report the most noteworthy is
the complete absence of any mention of the problem of the stability of
the price-level; and it cheerfully explains how the pre-war system,
which it aims at restoring, operated to bring back equilibrium by
deliberately causing a “consequent slackening of employment.” The
Cunliffe Report belongs to an extinct and an almost forgotten order
of ideas. Few think on these lines now; yet the Report remains the
authorised declaration of our policy, and the Bank of England and the
Treasury are said still to regard it as their marching orders.

Let us return to the regulation of note issue. If we agree that gold
is not to be employed in the circulation, and that it is better to
employ some other criterion than the ratio of gold reserves to note
issue in deciding to raise or to lower the bank rate, it follows that
the only employment for gold (nevertheless important) is as a store
of value to be held as a war-chest against emergencies and as a means
of rapidly correcting the influence of a temporarily adverse balance
of international payments and thus maintaining a day-to-day stability
of the sterling-dollar exchange. It is desirable, therefore, that the
whole of the reserves should be under the control of the authority
responsible for this, which, under the above proposals, is the Bank
of England. The volume of the paper money, on the other hand, would
be consequential, as it is at present, on the state of trade and
employment, bank-rate policy and Treasury Bill policy. The governors
of the system would be bank-rate and Treasury Bill policy, the objects
of government would be stability of trade, prices, and employment,
and the volume of paper money would be a consequence of the first
(just--I repeat--as it is at present) and an instrument of the second,
the precise arithmetical level of which could not and need not be
predicted. Nor would the amount of gold, which it would be prudent
to hold as a reserve against international emergencies and temporary
indebtedness, bear any logical or calculable relation to the volume of
paper money;--for the two have no close or necessary connection with
one another. Therefore I make the proposal--which may seem, but should
not be, shocking--of separating entirely the gold reserve from the note
issue. Once this principle is adopted, the regulations are matters of
detail. The gold reserves of the country should be concentrated in the
hands of the Bank of England, to be used for the purpose of avoiding
short-period fluctuations in the exchange. The Currency Notes may,
just as well as not--since the Treasury is to draw the profit from
them--be issued by the Treasury, without the latter being subjected to
any formal regulations (which are likely to be either inoperative or
injurious) as to their volume. Except in form, this régime would not
differ materially from the existing state of affairs.

The reader will observe that I retain for gold an important rôle in
our system. As an ultimate safeguard and as a reserve for sudden
requirements, no superior medium is yet available. But I urge that
it is possible to get the benefit of the advantages of gold, without
irrevocably binding our legal-tender money to follow blindly all the
vagaries of gold and future unforeseeable fluctuations in its real
purchasing power.


II. _The United States._

The above proposals are recommended to Great Britain and their details
have been adapted to her case. But the principles underlying them
remain just as true across the Atlantic. In the United States, as in
Great Britain, the methods which are being actually pursued at the
present time, half consciously and half unconsciously, are mainly on
the lines I advocate. In practice the Federal Reserve Board often
ignores the proportion of its gold reserve to its liabilities and
is influenced, in determining its discount policy, by the object
of maintaining stability in prices, trade, and employment. Out of
convention and conservatism it accepts gold. Out of prudence and
understanding it buries it. Indeed the theory and investigation of
the credit cycle have been taken up so much more enthusiastically and
pushed so much further by the economists of the United States than by
those of Great Britain, that it would be even more difficult for the
Federal Reserve Board than for the Bank of England to ignore such ideas
or to avoid being, half-consciously at least, influenced by them.

The theory on which the Federal Reserve Board is supposed to govern its
discount policy, by reference to the influx and efflux of gold and the
proportion of gold to liabilities, is as dead as mutton. It perished,
and perished justly, as soon as the Federal Reserve Board began to
ignore its ratio and to accept gold without allowing it to exercise its
full influence,[56] merely because an expansion of credit and prices
seemed at that moment undesirable. From that day gold was demonetised
by almost the last country which still continued to do it lip-service,
and a dollar standard was set up on the pedestal of the Golden Calf.
For the past two years the United States has _pretended_ to maintain
a gold standard. _In fact_ it has established a dollar standard; and,
instead of ensuring that the value of the dollar shall conform to that
of gold, it makes provision, at great expense, that the value of gold
shall conform to that of the dollar. This is the way by which a rich
country is able to combine new wisdom with old prejudice. It can enjoy
the latest scientific improvements, devised in the economic laboratory
of Harvard, whilst leaving Congress to believe that no rash departure
will be permitted from the hard money consecrated by the wisdom and
experience of Dungi, Darius, Constantine, Lord Liverpool, and Senator
Aldrich.

       [56] The influx of gold could not be prevented from having
            _some_ inflationary effect because its receipt
            automatically increased the balances of the member banks.
            This uncontrollable element cannot be avoided so long as
            the United States Mints are compelled to accept gold.
            But the gold was not allowed to exercise the multiplied
            influence which the pre-war system presumed.

No doubt it is worth the expense--for those that can afford it. The
cost of the fiction to the United States is not more than £100,000,000
per annum and should not average in the long run above £50,000,000 per
annum. But there is in all such fictions a certain instability. When
the accumulations of gold heap up beyond a certain point the suspicions
of Congressmen may be aroused. One cannot be quite certain that some
Senator might not read and understand this book. Sooner or later the
fiction will lose its value.

Indeed it is desirable that this should be so. The new methods will
work more efficiently and more economically when they can be pursued
consciously, deliberately, and openly. The economists of Harvard know
more than those of Washington, and it will be well that in due course
their surreptitious victory should swell into public triumph. At any
rate those who are responsible for establishing the principles of
British currency should not overlook the possibility that some day soon
the Mints of the United States may be closed to the acceptance of gold
at a fixed dollar price.

Closing the Mints to the compulsory acceptance of gold need not affect
the existing obligation of convertibility;--the liability to encash
notes in gold might still remain. Theoretically this might be regarded
as a blemish on the perfection of the scheme. But, for the present at
least, it is unlikely that such a provision would compel the United
States to deflate,--which possibility is the only theoretical objection
to it. On the other hand, the retention of convertibility would remain
a safeguard satisfactory to old-fashioned people; and would reduce to
a minimum the new and controversial legislation required to effect the
change. Many people might agree to relieve the Mint of the liability to
accept gold which no one wants, who would be dismayed at any tampering
with convertibility. Moreover, in certain quite possible circumstances,
the obligation of convertibility might really prove to be a safeguard
against inflation brought about by political pressure contrary to the
judgement of the Federal Reserve Board;--for we have not, as yet,
sufficient experience as to the independence of the Federal Reserve
system against the farmers, for example, or other compact interests
possessing political influence.

Meanwhile Mr. Hoover and many banking authorities in England and
America, who look to the dispersion through the world of a reasonable
proportion of Washington’s gold, by the natural operation of trade and
investment, as a desirable and probable development, much misunderstand
the situation. At present the United States is open to accept gold at
a price in terms of goods above its natural value (above the value it
would have, that is to say, if it were allowed to affect credit and,
through credit, prices in orthodox pre-war fashion); and so long as
this is the case, gold must continue to flow there. The stream can
be stopped (so long as a change in the gold-value of the dollar is
ruled out of the question) only in one of two ways;--either by a fall
in the value of the dollar or by an increase in the value of gold
in the outside world. The former of these alternatives, namely the
depreciation of the dollar through inflation in the United States,
is that on which many English authorities have based their hopes.
But it could only come about by a reversal or defeat of the present
policy of the Federal Reserve Board. Moreover, the volume of redundant
gold is now so great, and the capacity of the rest of the world for
its absorption so much reduced, that the inflation would need to be
prolonged and determined to produce the required result. Dollar prices
would have to rise very high before America’s impoverished customers,
starving for real goods and having no use for barren metal, would
relieve her of £200,000,000 worth of gold in preference to taking
commodities. The banking authorities of the United States would be
likely to notice in good time that, if the gold is not wanted and must
be got rid of, it would be much simpler just to reduce the dollar price
of gold. The only way of selling redundant stocks of anything, whether
gold or copper or wheat, is to abate the price.

The alternative method, namely the increase in the value of gold in
the outside world, could scarcely be brought about unless some other
country or countries stepped in to relieve the United States of the
duty of burying unwanted gold. Great Britain, France, Italy, Holland,
Sweden, Argentine, Japan, and many other countries have fully as much
unoccupied gold as they require for an emergency store. Nor is there
anything to prevent them from buying gold now if they prefer gold to
other things.

The notion, that America can get rid of her gold by showing a greater
readiness to make loans to foreign countries, is incomplete. This
result will only follow if the loans are inflationary loans, not
provided for by the reduction of expenditure and investment in other
directions. Foreign investments formed out of real savings will no more
denude the United States of her gold than they denude Great Britain
of hers. But if the United States places a large amount of dollar
purchasing power in the hands of foreigners, as a pure addition to
the purchasing power previously in the hands of her own nationals,
then no doubt prices will rise and we shall be back on the method
of depreciating the dollar, just discussed, by a normal inflationary
process. Thus the invitation to the United States to deal with the
problem of her gold by increasing her foreign investments will not be
effective unless it is intended as an invitation to inflate.

       *       *       *       *       *

I argue, therefore, that the same policy which is wise for Great
Britain is wise for the United States, namely to aim at the stability
of the commodity-value of the dollar rather than at stability of the
gold-value of the dollar, and to effect the former if necessary by
varying the gold-value of the dollar.

If Great Britain and the United States were both embarked on this
policy and if both were successful, our secondary desideratum, namely
the stability of the dollar-exchange standard, would follow as a
consequence. I agree with Mr. Hawtrey that the ideal state of affairs
is an intimate co-operation between the Federal Reserve Board and
the Bank of England, as a result of which stability of prices and of
exchange would be achieved at the same time. But I suggest that it is
wiser and more practical that this should be allowed to develop out of
experience and mutual advantage, without either side binding itself to
the other. If the Bank of England aims primarily at the stability of
sterling, and the Federal Reserve Board at the stability of dollars,
each authority letting the other into its confidence so far as may be,
better results will be obtained than if sterling is unalterably fixed
by law in terms of dollars and the Bank of England is limited to using
its influence on the Federal Reserve Board to keep dollars steady. A
collaboration which is not free on both sides is likely to lead to
dissensions, especially if the business of keeping dollars steady
involves a heavy expenditure in burying unwanted gold.

We have reached a stage in the evolution of money when a “managed”
currency is inevitable, but we have not yet reached the point when the
management can be entrusted to a single authority. The best we can do,
therefore, is to have _two_ managed currencies, sterling and dollars,
with as close a collaboration as possible between the aims and methods
of the managements.


III. _Other Countries._

What course, in such an event, should other countries pursue? It is
necessary to presume to begin with that we are dealing with countries
which have not lost control of their currencies. But a stage can and
should be reached before long at which nearly all countries have
regained the control. In Russia, Poland, and Germany it is only
necessary that the Governments should develop some other source of
revenue than the inflationary or turn-over tax on the use of money
discussed in Chapter II. In France and Italy it is only necessary that
the franc and the lira should be devaluated at a level at which the
service of the internal debt is within the capacity of the taxpayer.

Control having been regained, there are probably no countries, other
than Great Britain and the United States, which would be justified in
attempting to set up an independent standard. Their wisest course would
be to base their currencies either on sterling or on dollars by means
of an exchange standard, fixing their exchanges in terms of one or the
other (though preserving, perhaps, a discretion to vary in the event
of a serious divergence between sterling and dollars), and maintaining
stability by holding reserves of gold at home and balances in London
and New York to meet short-period fluctuations, and by using bank-rate
and other methods to regulate the volume of purchasing power, and thus
to maintain stability of relative price level, over longer periods.

Perhaps the British Empire (apart from Canada) and the countries of
Europe would adopt the sterling standard; whilst Canada and the other
countries of North and South America would adopt the dollar standard.
But each could choose freely, until, with the progress of knowledge and
understanding, so perfect a harmony had been established between the
two that the choice was a matter of indifference.

8_vo._ ~8s. 6d.~ _net_.

THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE PEACE

_THE TIMES._--“Mr. Keynes writes with knowledge; he was himself one
of the chief actors in the Conference, and his book is an important
political event.... He brings great literary ability, a broad view, a
clear grasp of general principles, to bear upon the very complicated
matters with which he is occupied, and in his hands these questions
of coal, exchange, and reparation can be read with pleasure by the
non-technical student.”

_THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE._--“Mr. Keynes has produced a smashing and
unanswerable indictment of the economic settlement.”

_THE ATHENÆUM._--“This book is a perfectly well-equipped arsenal of
facts and arguments, to which every one will resort for years to
come who wishes to strike a blow against the forces of prejudice,
delusion, and stupidity. It is not easy to make large numbers of
men reasonable by a book, yet there are no limits to which, without
undue extravagance, we may not hope that the influence of this book
may extend.... Never was the case for reasonableness more powerfully
put. It is enforced with extraordinary art. What might easily have
been a difficult treatise, semi-official or academic, proves to be as
fascinating as a good novel.”


8_vo._ ~7s. 6d.~ _net_.

A REVISION OF THE TREATY

Being a Sequel to “The Economic Consequences of the Peace.”

_THE SPECTATOR._--“The sequel, like the earlier book, is a brilliant
performance regarded as economic argument and compact analysis, and it
also has the advantage of dealing in sardonic and sometimes pitiless
humour.”

_THE NATION._--“We found Mr. Keynes’s second book to be of the same
delightful texture as his first; showing a playfully impressive irony,
alternating with warning seriousness, and the extraordinary power of
economic analysis which has made him the greatest intellectual force in
the work of European restoration.”

_THE TIMES._--“Mr. Keynes has the gift of interesting his readers in
problems that are at once vital and obscure.”

_THE NEW STATESMAN._--“It is, like its predecessor, a pleasure to read,
lucid and concise in its economic arguments, dashing in its political
satires and its judgment of persons.”


8_vo._ ~18s.~ _net_.

A TREATISE ON PROBABILITY

_THE TIMES._--“Mr. Keynes’s book will certainly add to his reputation,
and is, indeed, in our opinion, the best book he has yet written.”

_THE NEW STATESMAN._--“The book will be at once ranked among the most
important contributions to the subject.”

_Prof. PIGOU in the ECONOMIC JOURNAL._--“The problems which Mr. Keynes
has touched, he has not only illuminated with a marvellous lucidity of
style, but has also substantially advanced.”

_THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN._--“Mr. Keynes’s book is undoubtedly one of
first-rate importance, and it is especially valuable on account of
the extension of its subject beyond the bounds of purely mathematical
probability.”

_THE SPECTATOR._--“The book contains a great deal that the general
reader will find both interesting and exhilarating.”


8_vo._ ~7s. 6d.~ _net_.

INDIAN CURRENCY AND FINANCE

_THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL._--“The book is, and is likely long to remain,
the standard work on its subject.... While academic students will
be grateful for this acute and informing work, it will be read with
as much interest, and perhaps even greater appreciation, by men of
business and affairs.”

_THE SPECTATOR._--“Mr. Keynes’s careful and disinterested study of the
monetary facts of twenty years, and his methodical marshalling of facts
and figures, will be useful even to those--and they will probably be
few--who are not convinced by his reasoning.”

_THE CLARE MARKET REVIEW._--“By his really masterly treatment of the
Indian currency system, the author has made a very valuable addition to
our economic literature.”

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PREFACE


When all but the last of the following chapters were already in type,
I was offered a seat on the Royal Commission (1913) on Indian Finance
and Currency. If my book had been less far advanced, I should, of
course, have delayed publication until the Commission had reported,
and my opinions had been more fully formed by the discussions of the
Commission and by the evidence placed before it. In the circumstances,
however, I have decided to publish immediately what I had already
written, without the addition of certain other chapters which had been
projected. The book, as it now stands, is wholly prior in date to the
labours of the Commission.

CHAPTER I

THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE RUPEE


1. On the broad historical facts relating to Indian currency, I do
not intend to spend time. It is sufficiently well known that until
1893 the currency of India was on the basis of silver freely minted,
the gold value of the rupee fluctuating with the gold value of silver
bullion. By the depreciation in the gold value of silver, extending
over a long period of years, trade was inconvenienced, and Public
Finance, by reason of the large payments which the Government must make
in sterling, gravely disturbed; until in 1893, after the breakdown of
negotiations for bimetallism, the Indian Mints were closed to the free
mintage of silver, and the value of the rupee divorced from the value
of the metal contained in it. By withholding new issues of currency,
the Government had succeeded by 1899 in raising the gold value of the
rupee to 1s. 4d., at which figure it has remained without sensible
variation ever since.

2. There can be no doubt that at first the Government of India did not
fully understand the nature of the new system; and that several minor
mistakes were made at its inception. But few are now found who dispute
on broad general grounds the wisdom of the change from a silver to a
gold standard.

Time has muffled the outcries of the silver interests, and time has
also dealt satisfactorily with what were originally the principal
grounds of criticism, namely,—

 (1) that the new system was unstable,

 (2) that a depreciating currency is advantageous to a country’s
 foreign trade.

3. The second of these complaints was urged with great persistency
in 1893. The depreciating rupee acted, it was said, as a bounty to
exporters; and the introduction of a gold standard, so it was argued,
would greatly injure the export trade in tea, corn, and manufactured
cotton. It was plainly pointed out by theorists at the time (_a_) that
the advantage to exporters was largely at the expense of other members
of the community and could not profit the country as a whole, and (_b_)
that it could only be temporary.

The recent spell of rising prices in India has shown clearly in how
many ways a depreciating currency damages large sections of the
community, although it may temporarily benefit other sections. In fact,
some recent complaints against the existing currency policy have been
occasioned by the tendency of prices to rise; whereas it is plain that
the great change of 1893 must have tended to make them fall, and that
rupee prices would, in all probability, be higher than they now are, if
the change had not been effected.

With regard to the temporary nature of the effect on exporters,
experience has decisively supported theory. The nature of this
experience was admirably summed up by Mr. J. B. Brunyate in the
Legislative Council (February 25, 1910), speaking in reply to the
similar line of argument brought forward by the Bombay mill–owning
interests in connexion with the imposition in 1910 of a duty on
silver.[1]

4. The criticisms of 1893, therefore, are no longer heard, and the
Currency Problems with which we are now confronted are new. The
evolution of the Indian currency system since 1899 has been rapid,
though silent. There have been few public pronouncements of policy
on the part of Government, and the legislative changes have been
inconsiderable. Yet a system has been developed, which was contemplated
neither by those who effected nor by those who opposed the closing of
the Mints in 1893, and which was not favoured either by the Government
or by the Fowler Committee in 1899, although something like it was
suggested at that time. It is not possible to point to any one date at
which the currency policy now in force was deliberately adopted.

The fact that the Government of India have drifted into a system
and have never set it forth plainly is partly responsible for a
widespread misunderstanding of its true character. But this economy
of explanation, from which the system has suffered in the past, does
not make it any the worse intrinsically. The prophecy made before the
Committee of 1898 by Mr. A. M. Lindsay, in proposing a scheme closely
similar in principle to that which was eventually adopted, has been
largely fulfilled. “This change,” he said, “will pass unnoticed, except
by the intelligent few, and it is satisfactory to find that by this
almost imperceptible process the Indian currency will be placed on a
footing which Ricardo and other great authorities have advocated as the
best of all currency systems, viz., one in which the currency media
used in the internal circulation are confined to notes and cheap token
coins, which are made to act precisely as if they were bits of gold by
being made convertible into gold for foreign payment purposes.”

5. In 1893 four possible bases of currency seemed to hold the field:
debased and depreciating currencies usually of paper; silver;
bimetallism; and gold. It was not to be supposed that the Government
of India intended to adopt the first; the second they were avowedly
upsetting; the third they had attempted, and had failed, to obtain by
negotiation. It seemed to follow that their ultimate objective must
be the last—namely, a currency of gold. The Committee of 1892 did
not commit themselves; but the system which their recommendations
established was generally supposed to be transitional and a first step
towards the introduction of gold. The Committee of 1898 explicitly
declared themselves to be in favour of the eventual establishment of a
gold currency.

This goal, if it was their goal, the Government of India have never
attained. The rupee is still the principal medium of exchange and is
of unlimited legal tender. There is no legal enactment compelling any
authority to redeem rupees with gold. The fact that since 1899 the
gold value of the rupee has only fluctuated within narrow limits is
solely due to administrative measures which the Government are under
no compulsion to undertake. What, then, is the present position of the
rupee?

6. The main features of the Indian system as now established are as
follows:—

(1) The rupee is unlimited legal tender and, so far as the law
provides, inconvertible.

(2) The sovereign is unlimited legal tender at £1 to 15 rupees, and is
convertible at this rate, so long as a Notification issued in 1893 is
not withdrawn, _i.e._, the Government can be required to give 15 rupees
in exchange for £1.

(3) As a matter of administrative practice, the Government is, as a
rule, willing to give sovereigns for rupees at this rate; but the
practice is sometimes suspended and large quantities of gold cannot
always be obtained in India by tendering rupees.

(4) As a matter of administrative practice, the Government will sell in
Calcutta, in return for rupees tendered there, bills payable in London
in sterling at a rate not more unfavourable than 1s. 3–29/32d. per
rupee.

The fourth of these provisions is the vital one for supporting the
sterling value of the rupee; and, although the Government have given no
binding undertaking to maintain it, a failure to do so might fairly be
held to involve an utter breakdown of their system.

Thus the second provision prevents the sterling value of the rupee from
rising above 1s. 4d. by more than the cost of remitting sovereigns to
India, and the fourth provision prevents it from falling below 1s.
3–29/32d. This means in practice that the extreme limits of variation
of the sterling value of the rupee are 1s. 4⅛d. and 1s. 3–29/32d.

7. The important characteristics of the Indian system are so much
a matter of notification and administrative practice that it is
impossible to point to single Acts which have made the system what
it is. But the following list of dates may be useful for purposes of
reference:—

 1892. Herschell Committee on Indian Currency.

 1893. Act closing the Indian mints to the coinage of silver on private
 account. Notifications by Government fixing the rate, at which rupees
 or notes would be supplied in exchange for the tender of gold, at the
 equivalent of 1s. 4d. the rupee.

 1898. Fowler Committee on Indian Currency. Exchange value of rupee
 touched 1s. 4d.

 1899. Act declaring the British sovereign legal tender at 1s. 4d. to
 the rupee.

 1899–1903. Negotiations for coinage of sovereigns in India (dropt
 indefinitely Feb. 6, 1903).

 1900. Gold Standard Reserve instituted out of profits of coinage.

 1904. Secretary of State’s notification of his willingness to sell
 Council Bills on India at 1s. 4⅛d. the rupee without limit.

 1905. Act authorising the establishment of the Currency Chest of
 “earmarked” gold at the Bank of England as part of the Currency
 Reserve against notes,[2] and the investment of a stated part of the
 Currency Reserve in sterling securities.


 1906. The Notification withdrawn which had directed the issue of
 rupees against the tender of gold (as distinguished from British gold
 coin).

 1907. Rupee branch of the Gold Standard Reserve instituted.

 1908. Sterling drafts sold in Calcutta on London at 1s. 3–29/32d. the
 rupee, and cashed out of funds from the Gold Standard Reserve.

 1910. Act rendering Currency notes of Rs. 10 and 50 universal legal
 tender,[3] and directing the issue of notes in exchange for British
 gold coins.


 1913. Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency.

8. In § 6 I have stated the practical effect of these successive
measures. But the legal position is so complicated and peculiar, that
it will be worth while to state it quite precisely. Previous to 1893
the Government were bound by the Coinage Act of 1870 to issue rupees,
weight for weight, in exchange for silver bullion. There was also in
force a Notification of the Governor–General in Council, dating from
1868, by which sovereigns were received at Government Treasuries as
the equivalent of ten rupees and four annas. This Notification, which
had superseded a Notification of 1864 fixing the exchange at ten
rupees, had long been inoperative (as the gold exchange value of ten
rupees four annas had fallen much below a sovereign). The Act of 1893
was merely a repealing Act, necessary in order to do away with those
provisions of the Act of 1870 which provided for the free mintage of
silver into rupees. At the same time (1893) the Notification of 1868
was superseded by a new Notification fixing fifteen rupees as the
rate at which sovereigns would be accepted at Government Treasuries;
and a Notification was issued under the Paper Currency Act of 1882,
directing the issue of currency notes in exchange for gold at the Rs.
15 to £1 ratio. The direct issue of rupees against the tender of gold
also has been regulated by a series of Notifications, of which the
first was published in 1893, up to 1906 rupees being issued against
either gold coin or gold bullion; and since 1906 against sovereigns and
half–sovereigns only. Apart from Notifications, an Act of 1899 declared
British sovereigns legal tender at the Rs. 15 to £1 ratio, an indirect
effect of which was to make it possible for Government, so far as Acts
are concerned, to redeem notes in gold coin and refuse silver. And
lastly, the Paper Currency Act of 1910 bound the Government to issue
notes against the tender of British gold coin.

The convertibility of the sovereign into rupees at the Rs. 15 to £1
ratio is not laid down, therefore, in any Act whatever. It depends
on Notifications withdrawable by the Executive at will. Further, the
management of the Gold Standard Reserve is governed neither by Act nor
by Notification, but by administrative practice solely; and the sale of
Council Bills on India and of sterling drafts on London is regulated by
announcements changeable at administrative discretion from time to time.

All this emphasises the gradual nature of the system’s growth, and
the transitional character of existing legislation. As matters now
are, there is something to be said for a new Act, which, while leaving
administrative discretion free where there is still good ground for
this, might consolidate and clarify the position.

9. As a result of these various measures, the rupee remains the local
currency in India, but the Government take precautions for ensuring its
convertibility into international currency at an approximately stable
rate. The stability of the Indian system depends upon their keeping
sufficient reserves of coined rupees to enable them at all times to
exchange international currency for local currency; and sufficient
liquid resources in sterling to enable them to change back the local
currency into international currency, whenever they are required to
do so. The special features of the system, although, as we shall see
later, these features are not in fact by any means peculiar to India,
are: first, that the actual medium of exchange is a local currency
distinct from the international currency; second, that the Government
is more ready to redeem the local currency (rupees) in bills payable
in international currency (gold) at a foreign centre (London) than to
redeem it outright locally; and third, that the Government, having
taken on itself the responsibility for providing local currency in
exchange for international currency and for changing back local
currency into international currency when required, must keep two kinds
of reserves, one for each of these purposes.

I will deal with these characteristics in successive chapters. It
is convenient to begin with the second of them and at the outset to
discuss in a general way the system of currency, of which the Indian
is the most salient example, known to students as the _Gold–Exchange
Standard_. Then we will take the first of them in Chapters III. and IV.
on _Paper Currency_ and on the _Present Position of Gold in India and
Proposals for a Gold Currency_; and the third in Chapter VI. on the
_Secretary of State’s Reserves_.

10. But before we pass to these several features of the Indian system,
it will be worth while to emphasise two respects in which this system
is _not_ peculiar. In the first place a system, in which the rupee is
maintained at 1s. 4d. by regulation, does not affect the level of
prices differently from the way in which it would be affected by a
system in which the rupee was a gold coin worth 1s. 4d., except in a
very indirect and unimportant way to be explained in a moment. So long
as the rupee is worth 1s. 4d. in gold, no merchant or manufacturer
considers of what material it is made when he fixes the price of his
product. The _indirect_ effect on prices, due to the rupee’s being
silver, is similar to the effect of the use of any medium of exchange,
such as cheques or notes, which economises the use of gold. If the
use of gold is economised in any country, gold throughout the world
is less valuable—gold prices, that is to say, are higher. But as
this effect is shared by the whole world, the effect on prices in
any country of economies in the use of gold made by that country is
likely to be relatively slight. In short, a policy which led to a
greater use of gold in India would tend, by increasing the demand for
gold in the world’s markets, somewhat to lower the level of world
prices as measured in gold; but it would not cause any alteration
worth considering in the _relative_ rates of exchange of Indian and
non–Indian commodities.

In the second place, although it is true that the maintenance of the
rupee at or near 1s. 4d. is due to regulation, it is not true, when
once 1s. 4d. rather than some other gold value has been determined,
that the volume of currency in circulation depends in the least upon
the policy of the Government or the caprice of an official.[4] This
part of the system is as perfectly automatic as in any other country.
The Government has put itself under an obligation to supply rupees
whenever sovereigns are tendered, and it often permits or encourages
the tender of sovereigns in London as well as in India; but it has no
power or opportunity of forcing rupees into circulation otherwise. In
two matters only does the Government use a discretionary power. First,
in order that it may always be possible to fulfil this obligation, it
is necessary to keep a certain reserve of coined rupees, just as some
authority in this country—in point of fact the Bank of England—must
keep some reserve of token silver and coined sovereigns and not hold
in its vaults too large a proportion of uncoined or foreign gold.
The magnitude of this reserve is within the discretion of the Indian
Government. To a certain extent they must anticipate probable demands
on the output of the Mint. But if they miscalculate and mint more than
they need, the new rupees must lie in the Government’s own chests until
they are wanted, and the date at which they emerge into circulation
it is beyond the power of the Government to determine. In the second
place, the Government can postpone for a short time a demand for rupees
by refusing to supply them in return for sovereigns tendered in London
and by insisting upon the sovereigns being sent to Calcutta. Sometimes
they do this, but very often it is worth their while, for reasons to
be explained in detail later on, to accept the tender of sovereigns in
London. In either of these cases the permanent effect of their action
one way or the other on the volume of circulation is inconsiderable.
The kind of difference it makes is comparable to the difference which
would be made if it lay within the discretion of a government to charge
or not, as it saw fit, a small _brassage_ not much greater than the
cost of coining.[5]




CHAPTER II

THE GOLD–EXCHANGE STANDARD


1. If we are to see the Indian system in its proper perspective, it is
necessary to digress for a space to a discussion of currency evolution
in general.

My purpose is, first, to show that the British system is peculiar
and is not suited to other conditions; second, that the conventional
idea of “sound” currency is chiefly derived from certain superficial
aspects of the British system; third, that a somewhat different type of
system has been developed in most other countries; and fourth, that in
essentials the system which has been evolved in India conforms to this
foreign type. I shall be concerned throughout this chapter with the
general characteristics of currency systems, not with the details of
their working.

2. The history of currency, so far as it is relevant to our present
purpose, virtually begins with the nineteenth century. During the
second quarter of this century England was alone in possessing an
orthodox “sound” currency on a gold basis. Gold was the sole standard
of value; it circulated freely from hand to hand; and it was freely
available for export. Up to 1844 bank notes showed a tendency to
become a formidable rival to gold as the actual medium of exchange.
But the Bank Act of that year set itself to hamper this tendency and
to encourage the use of gold as the medium of exchange as well as the
standard of value. This Act was completely successful in stopping
attempts to economise gold by the use of notes. But the Bank Act
did nothing to hinder the use of cheques, and the very remarkable
development of this medium of exchange during the next fifty years led
in this country, without any important development in the use of notes
or tokens, to a monetary organisation more perfectly adapted for the
economy of gold than any which exists elsewhere. In this matter of
the use of cheques Great Britain has been followed by the rest of the
English–speaking world—Canada, Australia, South Africa, and the United
States of America. But in other countries currency evolution has been,
chiefly, along different lines.

3. In the early days of banking of the modern type in England, gold was
not infrequently required to meet runs on banks by their depositors,
who were always liable in difficult times to fall into a state of panic
lest they should be unable to withdraw their deposits in case of real
need. With the growth of the stability of banking, and especially with
the growth of confidence in this stability amongst depositors, these
occasions have become more and more infrequent, and many years have
now passed since there has been any run of dangerous proportions on
English banks. Gold reserves, therefore, in Great Britain are no longer
held primarily with a view to emergencies of this kind. The uses of
gold coin in Great Britain are now three—as the medium of exchange for
certain kinds of out–of–pocket expenditure, such as that on railway
travelling, for which custom requires cash payment; for the payment of
wages; and to meet a drain of specie abroad.

Fluctuations in the demand for gold in the first two uses are of
secondary importance, and can usually be predicted with a good deal
of accuracy,—at holiday seasons, at the turn of the quarter, at the
end of the week, at harvest. Fluctuations in the demand in the third
use are of greater magnitude and, apart from the regular autumn drain,
not so easily foreseen. Our gold reserve policy is mainly dictated,
therefore, by considerations arising out of the possible demand for
export.

To guard against a possible drain of gold abroad, a complicated
mechanism has been developed which in the details of its working is
peculiar to this country. A drain of gold can only come about if
foreigners choose to turn into gold claims, which they have against us
for immediate payment, and we have no counterbalancing claims against
them for equally immediate payment. The drain can only be stopped
if we can rapidly bring to bear our counterbalancing claims. When we
come to consider how this can best be done, it is to be noticed that
the position of a country which is preponderantly a creditor in the
international short–loan market is quite different from that of a
country which is preponderantly a debtor. In the former case, which
is that of Great Britain, it is a question of reducing the amount
lent; in the latter case it is a question of increasing the amount
borrowed. A machinery which is adapted for action of the first kind
may be ill suited for action of the second. Partly as a consequence
of this, partly as a consequence of the peculiar organisation of
the London Money Market, the “bank rate” policy for regulating the
outflow of gold has been admirably successful in this country, and yet
cannot stand elsewhere unaided by other devices. It is not necessary
for the purposes of this survey to consider precisely how changes
in the bank rate affect the balance of immediate indebtedness. It
will be sufficient to say that it tends to hamper the brokers, who
act as middlemen between the British short–loan fund and the foreign
demand for accommodation (chiefly materialised in the offer of bills
for discount), and to cause them to enter into a less volume of new
business than that of the short loans formerly contracted and now
falling due, thus bringing to bear the necessary counterbalancing
claims against foreign countries.

4. The essential characteristics of the British monetary system are,
therefore, the use of cheques as the principal medium of exchange,
and the use of the bank rate for regulating the balance of immediate
foreign indebtedness (and hence the flow, by import and export, of
gold).

5. The development of foreign monetary systems into their present
shapes began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. At that
time London was at the height of her financial supremacy, and her
monetary arrangements had stood the test of time and experience.
Foreign systems, therefore, were greatly influenced at their inception
by what were regarded as the fundamental tenets of the British system.
But foreign observers seem to have been more impressed by the fact
that the Englishman had sovereigns in his pocket than by the fact
that he had a cheque–book in his desk; and took more notice of the
“efficacy” of the bank rate and of the deliberations of the Court
of Directors on Thursdays, than of the peculiar organisation of the
brokers and the London Money Market, and of Great Britain’s position
as a creditor nation. They were thus led to imitate the form rather
than the substance. When they introduced the gold standard, they set
up gold currencies as well; and in several cases an official bank rate
was established on the British model. Germany led the way in 1871–73.
Even now apologists of the Reichsbank will sometimes speak as if its
bank rate were efficacious by itself in the same manner as the Bank of
England’s. But, in fact, the German system, though ostensibly modelled
in part upon the British system, has become, by force of circumstances,
essentially different.

It is not necessary for this survey to consider individual systems in
any detail. But, confining ourselves to European countries, whether we
consider, for example, France, Austria–Hungary, Russia, Italy, Sweden,
or Holland, while most of these countries have a gold currency and an
official Bank Rate, in none of them is gold the principal medium of
exchange, and in none of them is the bank rate their only habitual
support against an outward drain of gold.

6. With the use of substitutes for gold I will deal in Chapter IV. in
treating of the proper position of gold in the Indian system. But what
props are commonly brought to the support of an “ineffective” Bank
Rate in countries other than Great Britain? Roughly speaking, there
are three. A very large gold reserve may be maintained, so that a
substantial drain on it may be faced with equanimity; free payments in
gold may be partially suspended; or foreign credits and bills may be
kept which can be drawn upon when necessary. The Central Banks of most
European countries depend (in varying degrees) upon all three.

The Bank of France uses the first two,[6] and her holdings of foreign
bills are not, at normal times, important.[7] Her bank rate is not
fixed primarily with a view to foreign conditions, and a change in it
is usually intended to affect home affairs (though these may of course
depend and react on foreign affairs).

Germany is in a state of transition, and her present position is
avowedly unsatisfactory. The theory of her arrangements seems to be
that she depends on her bank rate after the British model; but in
practice her bank rate is not easily rendered effective, and must
usually be reinforced by much unseen pressure by the Reichsbank on
the other elements of the money market. Her gold reserve is not large
enough for the first expedient to be used lightly. Free payment in
gold is sometimes, in effect, partially suspended,[8] though covertly
and with shame. To an increasing extent the Reichsbank depends on
variations in her holding of foreign bills and credits. A few years ago
such holdings were of small importance. The table given below shows
with what rapidity the part taken by foreign bills and credits in the
finance of the Reichsbank has been growing. The authorities of the
Reichsbank have now learnt that their position in the international
short loan market is not one which permits them to fix the bank rate
and then idly to await the course of events.

7. If we pass from France, whose position as a creditor country is not
altogether unlike Great Britain’s, and from Germany, which is at any
rate able to do a good deal towards righting the balance of immediate
indebtedness by the sale of securities having an international market,
to other countries of less financial strength, we find the dependence
of their Central Banks on holdings of foreign bills and on foreign
credits, their willingness to permit a premium on gold, and the
inadequacy of their bank rates taken by themselves, to be increasingly
marked. I will first mention very briefly one or two salient facts, and
will then consider their underlying meaning, always with an ultimate
view to their bearing on the affairs of India.

8. To illustrate how rare a thing in Europe a perfect and automatic
gold standard is, let us take the most recent occasion of
stringency—November 1912. The Balkan War was at this time at an
acute stage, but the European situation was only moderately anxious.
Compared with the crisis at the end of 1907, the financial position
was one of comparative calm. Yet in the course of that month there was
a premium on gold of about ¾ per cent in France, Germany, Russia,
Austria–Hungary,[9] and Belgium. So high a premium as this is as
effective in retaining gold as a very considerable addition to the
bank rate. If, for example, the premium did not last more than three
months, it would add to the profits of a temporary deposit of funds for
that period as much as an addition of 3 per cent to the discount rate;
or, to put it the other way round, there would need to be an additional
profit of 3 per cent elsewhere if it were to be worth while to send
funds abroad.

9. The growing importance of foreign bills in the portfolios of the
Reichsbank has been shown above. The importance of foreign bills
and credits in the policy of the Austro–Hungarian Bank is of longer
standing and is better known. They always form an important part of
its reserves, and the part first utilised in times of stringency.[10]
It was supposed that in the third quarter of 1911 the Bank placed
not less than £4,000,000 worth of gold bills at the disposal of
the Austro–Hungarian market in order to support exchange. Amongst
European countries, Russia now keeps the largest aggregate of funds
in foreign bills and in balances abroad—amounting in November 1912
to £26,630,000.[11] Account being taken of their total resources,
however, the banks of the three Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway,
and Denmark, hold the highest proportion in the form of balances
abroad—amounting in November 1912, for the three countries in the
aggregate, to about £7,000,000. These are enough examples for my
purpose.

10. What is the underlying significance of this growing tendency on
the part of European State Banks to hold a part of their reserves in
foreign bills or foreign credits? We saw above that the bank–rate
policy of the Bank of England is successful because by indirect means
it causes the Money Market to reduce its short–period loans to foreign
countries, and thus to turn the balance of immediate indebtedness in
our favour. This indirect policy is less feasible in countries where
the Money Market is already a borrower rather than a lender in the
international market. In such countries a rise in the bank–rate cannot
be relied on to produce the desired effect with due rapidity. A direct
policy on the part of the Central Bank, therefore, must be employed.
If the Money Market is not a lender in the international market, the
Bank itself must be at pains to become to some extent one. The Bank of
England lends to middlemen who, by holding bills or otherwise, lend
abroad. A rise in the bank rate is equivalent to putting pressure on
these middlemen to diminish their commitments. In countries where the
Money Market is neither so highly developed nor, in relation to foreign
countries, so self–supporting, the Central Bank, if it is to be secure,
must take the matter in hand itself and, by itself entering the
international money market as a lender at short notice, place itself in
funds, at foreign centres, which can be rapidly withdrawn when they are
required. The only alternative would be the holding of a much larger
reserve of gold, the expense of which would be nearly intolerable.
The new method combines safety with economy. Just as individuals have
learnt that it is cheaper and not less safe to keep their ultimate
reserves on deposit at their bankers than to keep them at home in
cash, so the second stage of monetary evolution is now entered on, and
nations are learning that _some part_ of the cash reserves of their
banks (we cannot go further than this at present) may be properly kept
on deposit in the international money market. This is not the expedient
of second–rate or impoverished countries; it is the expedient of all
those who have not attained a high degree of financial supremacy—of
all those, in fact, who are not themselves international bankers.

11. In the forty years, therefore, during which the world has been
coming on to a gold standard (without, however, giving up for
that reason its local currencies of notes or token silver), two
devices—apart from the bullion reserve itself and the bank rate—have
been evolved for protecting the local currencies. The first is to
permit a small variation in the ratio of exchange between the local
currency and gold, amounting perhaps to an occasional premium of
¾ per cent on the latter; this may help to tide over a stringency
which is seasonal or of short duration without raising to a dangerous
level the rate of discount on purely local transactions. The second
is for the Government or Central Bank to hold resources available
abroad, which can be used for maintaining the gold parity of the local
currency, when there is the need for it.

12. We are now more nearly in a position to come back to the currency
of India herself, and to see it in its proper relation to those
of other countries. At one end of the scale we have Great Britain
and France—creditor nations in the short–loan market.[12] In an
intermediate position comes Germany—a creditor in relation to many of
her neighbours, but apt to be a debtor in relation to France, Great
Britain, and the United States. Next come such countries as Russia and
Austria–Hungary—rich and powerful, with immense reserves of gold, but
debtor nations, dependent in the short–loan market on their neighbours.
From the currencies of these it is an easy step to those of the great
trading nations of Asia—India, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies.

13. I say that from the currencies of such countries as Russia
and Austria–Hungary to those which have explicitly and in name a
Gold–Exchange Standard[13] it is an easy step. The Gold–Exchange
Standard is simply a more regularised form of the same system as
theirs. In their essential characteristics and in the monetary logic
which underlies them the currencies of India and Austria–Hungary (to
take these as our examples) are not really different. In India we
know the extreme limits of fluctuation in the exchange value of the
rupee; we know the precise volume of reserves which the Government
holds in gold and in credits abroad; and we know at what moment the
Government will step in and utilise these resources for the support of
the rupee. In Austria–Hungary the system is less automatic, and the
Bank is allowed a wide discretion. In detail, of course, there are a
number of differences. India keeps a somewhat higher proportion of her
reserves in foreign credits, and keeps some part of these credits in
a less liquid form. She also keeps a portion of her gold reserve in
London—a practice made possible by the fact that for India London is
not strictly a foreign centre. On the other hand, India is probably
more willing than the Bank of Austria–Hungary to supply gold on demand.
If we are to judge from the experience of recent years, India inclines
to use her gold reserves, Austria–Hungary her foreign credits, first.
But in the essentials of the Gold–Exchange Standard—the use of a local
currency mainly not of gold, some degree of unwillingness to supply
gold locally in exchange for the local currency, but a high degree of
willingness to sell foreign exchange for payment in local currency
at a certain maximum rate, and to use foreign credits in order to do
this—the two countries agree.

14. To say that the Gold–Exchange Standard merely carries somewhat
further the currency arrangements which several European countries
have evolved during the last quarter of a century is not, of course,
to justify it. But if we see that the Gold–Exchange Standard is not,
in the currency world of to–day, anomalous, and that it is in the
main stream of currency evolution, we shall have a wider experience,
on which to draw, in criticising it, and may be in a better position
to judge of its details wisely. Much nonsense is talked about a gold
standard’s properly carrying a gold currency with it. If we mean by
a gold currency a state of affairs in which gold is the principal
or even, in the aggregate, a very important medium of exchange, no
country in the world has such a thing.[14] Gold is an international,
but not a local currency. The currency problem of each country is
to ensure that they shall run no risk of being unable to put their
hands on international currency when they need it, and to waste as
small a proportion of their resources on holdings of actual gold
as is compatible with this. The proper solution for each country
must be governed by the nature of its position in the international
money market and of its relations to the chief financial centres,
and by those national customs in matters of currency which it may be
unwise to disturb. It is as an attempt to solve this problem that the
Gold–Exchange Standard ought to be judged.

15. We have been concerned so far with transitional systems of
currency. I will conclude this chapter with a brief history in outline
of the Gold–Exchange Standard itself. It will then be time to pass from
high generalities to the actual details of the Indian system.

The Gold–Exchange Standard arises out of the discovery that, so long as
gold is available for payments of _international_ indebtedness at an
approximately constant rate in terms of the national currency, it is
a matter of comparative indifference whether it actually _forms_ the
national currency.

The Gold–Exchange Standard may be said to exist when gold does not
circulate in a country to an appreciable extent, when the local
currency is not necessarily redeemable in gold, but when the Government
or Central Bank makes arrangements for the provision of foreign
remittances in gold at a fixed maximum rate in terms of the local
currency, the reserves necessary to provide these remittances being
kept to a considerable extent abroad.

A system closely resembling the Gold–Exchange Standard was actually
employed during the second half of the eighteenth century for
regulating the exchange between London and Edinburgh. Its theoretical
advantages were first set forth by Ricardo at the time of the
Bullionist Controversy. He laid it down that a currency is in its most
perfect state when it consists of a cheap material, but having an
equal value with the gold it professes to represent; and he suggested
that convertibility for the purposes of the foreign exchanges should
be ensured by the tendering on demand of gold _bars_ (not coin) in
exchange for notes,—so that gold might be available for purposes
of export only, and would be prevented from entering into the
internal circulation of the country. In an article contributed to
the _Contemporary Review_ of 1887, Dr. Marshall again brought these
advantages to the notice of practical men.

16. The first crude attempt in recent times at establishing a standard
of this type was made by Holland. The free coinage of silver was
suspended in 1877. But the currency continued to consist mainly of
silver and paper. It has been maintained since that date at a constant
value in terms of gold by the Bank’s regularly providing gold when it
is required for export and by its using its authority at the same
time for restricting so far as possible the use of gold at home. To
make this policy possible, the Bank of Holland has kept a reserve, of
a moderate and economical amount, partly in gold, partly in foreign
bills.[15] During the long period for which this policy has been
pursued, it has been severely tried more than once, but has stood the
test successfully.

It must be noticed, however, that although Holland has kept gold
and foreign bills as a means of obtaining a credit abroad at any
moment, she has not kept a standing credit in any foreign financial
centre. The method of keeping a token currency at a fixed par with
gold by means of credit abroad was first adopted by Count Witte for
Russia in the transitional period from inconvertible paper to a gold
standard;—in the autumn of 1892 the Department of Finance offered
to buy exchange on Berlin at 2·18 marks and to sell at 2·20. In the
same year (1892) the Austro–Hungarian system, referred to above, was
established. As in India their exchange policy was evolved gradually.
The present arrangements, which date from 1896, were made possible
by the strong preference of the public for notes over gold and by the
provision of the law which permitted the holding of foreign bills as
cover for the note issue. This exchange policy is the easier, because
the Austro–Hungarian Bank is by far the largest dealer in exchange in
Vienna;—just as the policy of the Government of India is facilitated
by the commanding influence which the system of Council Bills gives it
over the exchange market.

17. But although India was not the first country to lead the way to a
Gold–Exchange Standard, she was the first to adopt it in a complete
form. When in 1893, on the recommendation of the Herschell Committee,
following upon the agitation of the Indian Currency Association, the
Mints were closed to the free coinage of silver, it was believed that
the cessation of coinage and the refusal of the Secretary of State to
sell his bills below 1s. 4d. would suffice to establish this ratio of
exchange. The Government had not then the experience which we have now;
we now know that such measures are not by themselves sufficient, except
under the influence of favouring circumstances. As a matter of fact the
circumstances were, at first, unfavourable. Exchange fell considerably
below 1s. 4d., and the Secretary of State had to sell his bills for
what he could get. If there had been, at the existing level of prices,
a rapidly expanding demand for currency at the time when the Mints
were closed, the measures actually taken might very well have proved
immediately successful. But the demand did not expand, and the very
large issue of currency immediately before and just after the closure
of the Mints proved sufficient to satisfy the demand for several years
to come;—just as a demand for new currency on an abnormally high scale
from 1903 to 1907, accompanied by high rates of discount, was followed
in 1908 by a complete cessation of demand and a period of comparatively
low rates of discount. Favourable circumstances, however, came at
last, and by January 1898 exchange was stable at 1s. 4d. The Fowler
Committee, then appointed, recommended a gold currency as the ultimate
objective. It is since that time that the Government of India have
adopted, or drifted into, their present system.

18. The Gold–Exchange Standard in the form in which it has been adopted
in India is justly known as the Lindsay scheme. It was proposed and
advocated from the earliest discussions, when the Indian currency
problem first became prominent, by Mr. A. M. Lindsay, Deputy–Secretary
of the Bank of Bengal, who always maintained that “they _must_ adopt my
scheme despite themselves.” His first proposals were made in 1876 and
1878. They were repeated in 1885 and again in 1892, when he published
a pamphlet entitled _Ricardo’s Exchange Remedy_. Finally, he explained
his views in detail to the Committee of 1898.

Lindsay’s scheme was severely criticised both by Government officials
and leading financiers. Lord Farrer described it as “far too clever
for the ordinary English mind with its ineradicable prejudice for an
immediately tangible gold backing to all currencies.” Lord Rothschild,
Sir John Lubbock (Lord Avebury), Sir Samuel Montagu (the late Lord
Swaythling) all gave evidence before the Committee that any system
without a visible gold currency would be looked on with distrust.
Mr. Alfred de Rothschild went so far as to say that “in fact a gold
standard without a gold currency seemed to him an utter impossibility.”
Financiers of this type will not admit the feasibility of anything
until it has been demonstrated to them by practical experience. It
follows, therefore, that they will seldom give their support to what is
new.

19. Since the Indian system has been perfected and its provisions
generally known, it has been widely imitated both in Asia and
elsewhere. In 1903 the Government of the United States introduced a
system avowedly based on it into the Philippines. Since that time it
has been established, under the influence of the same Government,
in Mexico and Panama. The Government of Siam have adopted it. The
French have introduced it in Indo–China. Our own Colonial Office have
introduced it in the Straits Settlements and are about to introduce
it into the West African Colonies. Something similar has existed in
Java under Dutch influences for many years. The Japanese system is
virtually the same in practice. In China, as is well known, currency
reform has not yet been carried through. The Gold–Exchange Standard
is the only possible means of bringing China on to a gold basis, and
the alternative policy (the policy of our own Foreign Office) is to be
content at first with a standard, as well as a currency, of silver.
A powerful body of opinion, led by the United States, favours the
immediate introduction of a gold standard on the Indian model.

It may fairly be said, therefore, that in the ten years the
Gold–Exchange Standard has become the prevailing monetary system of
Asia. I have tried to show that it is also closely related to the
prevailing tendencies in Europe. Speaking as a theorist, I believe that
it contains one essential element—the use of a cheap local currency
artificially maintained at par with the international currency or
standard of value (whatever that may ultimately turn out to be)—in the
ideal currency of the future. But it is now time to turn to details.




CHAPTER III

PAPER CURRENCY


1. The chief characteristics of the Indian system of currency have
been roughly sketched in the first chapter. I will now proceed to a
description of the system of note issue.

2. In existing conditions the rupee, being a token coin, is virtually
a note printed on silver. The custom and convenience of the people
justify this, so far as concerns payment in small sums. But in itself
it is extravagant. When rupees are issued, the Government, instead of
being able to place to reserve the whole nominal value of the coin, is
able to retain only the difference between the nominal value and the
cost of the silver.[16] For large payments, therefore, it is important
to encourage the use of notes to the utmost extent possible,—from the
point of view of economy, because by these means the Government may
obtain a large part of the reserves necessary for the support of a
Gold–Exchange Standard, and also because only thus will it be possible
to introduce a proper degree of elasticity in the seasonal supply of
currency.

3. By Acts of 1839–43 the Presidency Banks of Bengal, Bombay, and
Madras were authorised to issue notes payable on demand; but the use of
the notes was practically limited to the three Presidency towns.[17]
These Acts were repealed in 1861, when the present Government Paper
Currency was first instituted. Since that time no banks have been
allowed to issue notes in India.

Proposals for a Government Paper Currency were instituted in 1859 by
Mr. James Wilson on his going out to India as the first Financial
Member.[18] Mr. Wilson died before his scheme could be carried into
effect, and the Act setting up the Paper Currency scheme, which became
law in 1861, differed in some important respects from his original
proposals.[19] The system was eventually set up under the influence
of the very rigid ideas as to the proper regulation of note issue
prevailing, as a result of the controversies which had culminated
in the British Bank Act of 1844, amongst English economists of that
time. According to these ideas, the proper principles of note issue
were two—first, that the function of note issue should be entirely
dissociated from that of banking; and second, that “the amount of notes
issued on Government securities should be maintained at a fixed sum,
within the limit of the smallest amount which experience has proved to
be necessary for the monetary transactions of the country, and that
any further amount of notes should be issued on coin or bullion.”[20]
These principles were orthodox and all others “unsound.” “The sound
principle for regulating the issue of a Paper Circulation,” wrote the
Secretary of State, “is that which was enforced on the Bank of England
by the Act of 1844.” In England, of course, bankers immediately set
themselves to recover the economy and elasticity, which the Act of
1844 banished from the English system, by other means; and with the
development of the cheque system to its present state of perfection
they have magnificently succeeded. In foreign countries all kinds of
new principles have been tried for the regulation of note issue, and
some of them have been very successful. In India the creed of 1861
is still repeated; but by unforeseen chance the words have changed
their meanings, and have permitted the old system to acquire through
inadvertence a certain degree of usefulness. The coin, in which the
greater part of the reserve had to be held, was, of course, the rupee.
In 1861 this was a freely minted coin worth no more than its bullion
value. When the rupee became an artificially valued token, rupees
tacitly remained the legitimate form of the reserve (although after
a time sovereigns were added as an optional alternative). Thus the
authorities are free, if they like, to hold the whole of the Currency
Reserve in rupee–tokens, and this reserve has become, therefore (as
we shall see below), an important part of the mechanism by which the
supply of silver rupees to the currency is duly regulated. While,
however, the note issue has managed to evolve an important function
for itself, I think the time has come when the usefulness of the
Currency Reserve may be much increased by a deliberate consideration
of the place it might fill in the organism of the Indian Money Market.
I return to this later in the chapter. In the meantime I pass to a
description of the Paper Currency as it now is—insisting, however,
that when we come to consider how it may be improved, the circumstances
of its origin be not forgotten.

4. For the first forty years of their existence the Government notes,
though always of growing importance, took a very minor place in the
currency system of the country. This was partly due to an arrangement,
now in gradual course of abolition, by which for the purposes of paper
currency India has been divided up in effect into several separate
countries. These ‘circles,’ as they are called, now seven[21] in
number, correspond roughly to the principal provinces of India, the
offices of issue being as follows:—

  Calcutta for Bengal, Eastern Bengal, and Assam.
  Cawnpore  ”  the United Provinces.
  Lahore    ”  the Punjab and North–West Frontier Province.
  Madras    ”  the Madras Presidency and Coorg.
  Bombay    ”  Bombay and the Central Provinces.
  Karachi   ”  Sind.
  Rangoon   ”  Burma.

The currency notes[22] are in the form of promissory notes of the
Government of India payable to the bearer on demand, and are of the
denominations Rs. 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 10,000. Thus the
lowest note is of the face value of 6s. 8d. They are issued without
limit from any Paper Currency office in exchange for rupees or British
gold coin, or (on the requisition of the Comptroller–General) for gold
bullion.[23]

5. Up to 1910 the following arrangements were in force.

Every note was legal tender in its own circle. Payment of dues to
the Government could be made in the currency notes of any circle;
and railway companies could, if they accepted notes of any circle
in payment of fares and freight, recover the value of them from the
Government.

But, until recently, no notes were legal tender outside their own
circle, and were payable only at the offices of issue of the town from
which they were originally issued.

Beyond this the law imposed no obligation to pay. For the accommodation
of the public, however, notes of other circles could be cashed at any
Paper Currency office to such extent as the convenience of each office
might permit. In ordinary circumstances every Government treasury, of
which there are about 250, has cashed or exchanged notes if it could do
so without inconvenience; and when this could not be done conveniently
for large sums, small sums have generally been exchanged for travellers.

6. It is easy to understand the reasons for these restrictions. India
is an enormously large country, over which the conditions of trade
lead coins to ebb and flow within each year. At the beginning of the
busy season when the autumn crops are harvested, rupees flow in great
volume from the Presidency towns up country; in early spring they are
carried to Burma for the rice crop; and so on—slowly finding their way
back again to the Presidency towns during the summer. If the Government
had made its notes encashable at a great variety of centres, it would
have been taking on itself the expense and responsibility of carrying
out these movements of coin at different seasons of the year. When a
country is habituated to the use of notes for making payments, they
can be very usefully employed for purposes of remittance also. But
a note–issuing authority puts itself in a difficulty if it provides
facilities for remittance before a general habit has grown up of using
notes for other purposes. If, on the other hand, the notes had been
made universal legal tender, but only encashable at Presidency towns,
there would undoubtedly have been a premium on coin at certain times of
the year. And this would have greatly hindered the growth of the notes’
popularity.

The Government, therefore, did what it could to make the notes useful
and popular for purposes other than those of remittance; and it
facilitated remittance so far as the proceeds of taxation, accumulating
in its treasuries, permitted it to do this without expense. But it
shrank from taking upon itself further responsibility. Its practice may
be compared with that of the branches of the Reichsbank.

On the other hand, the objections to a policy, which divided the
country up for the purposes of paper currency, are also plain. The
limitation of the areas of legal tender and of the offices where the
notes were encashable on demand greatly restricted the popularity of
the notes. It might well have seemed worth while to popularise them,
even at the expense of temporary loss. As soon as the public had
become satisfied that the notes could be turned into coin readily and
without question, their desire to cash them would probably have been
greatly diminished. It is not certain that Government would have lost
in the long–run if it had undertaken the responsibility and expense of
regulating the flow of coin to the districts where it might be wanted
at the different seasons of the year.

7. After the establishment of the Gold–Exchange Standard the importance
of enlarging the functions of the note issue became apparent; and
since 1900 the question of increasing the availability of the notes
has been constantly to the front. In 1900 the Government issued a
circular asking for opinions on certain proposals, including one for
“universalising” the notes or making them legal tender in all circles.
Some authorities thought that notes of small denominations (Rs. 5 and
Rs. 10) might be safely universalised, without risk (on account of the
trouble involved) of their being used for remittance on a large scale.
It is on these lines that the use of the notes has been developed. In
1903 five–rupee notes were universalised except in Burma—that is to
say, five–rupee notes of any circle were legal tender and encashable at
any office of issue outside Burma; and in 1909 the Burmese limitation
was removed.

In 1910 a great step forward was taken, and the law on the subject
was consolidated by a new Act. Notes of Rs. 10 and Rs. 50 were
universalised; and power was taken to universalise notes of higher
denominations by executive order. In pursuance of this authority notes
of Rs. 100 were universalised in 1911. “At the same time the receipt of
notes of the higher denominations in circles other than the circle of
issue, in payment of Government dues and in payments to railways, post
and telegraph offices, was stopped by executive orders”; and “with a
view to minimise any tendency to make use of the new universal notes
for remittance purposes, it was decided concurrently with the new Act
to offer facilities to bankers and merchants to make trade remittances
between the currency centres by means of telegraphic orders granted by
Government at a reduced rate of premium.”[24] In the following year
the Comptroller of Paper Currency reported that no difficulty whatever
was experienced as the result of universalising the Rs. 10 and Rs.
50 notes; and the inconveniences, the fear of which had retarded the
development of the note system for many years, were not realised.

8. The effect of these successive changes has been to make the old
system of circles virtually inoperative. With notes of Rs. 100
universal legal tender it is difficult to see what can prevent the
public from using them for purposes of remittance if they should wish
to do so. The “circles” can no longer serve any useful purpose, and it
would help to make clear in the public mind the nature of the Indian
note issue if they were to be abolished in name as well as in effect.

9. There must have been many occasions under the old system, on which
ignorant persons suffered inconvenience through having notes of
foreign circles passed off on them; and a long time may pass before
distrust of the notes, as things not readily convertible, bred out
of the memories of these occasions, entirely disappears. But, in
combination with other circumstances, the universalising of the notes
has had already a striking effect on the volume of their circulation,
as is shown in the figures given below. It should be explained that
by _gross_ circulation (in the Government Statistics) is meant the
value of all notes that have been issued and not yet paid off; that
the _net_ circulation is this sum less the value of notes held by
Government in its own treasuries; and that the _active_ circulation is
the _net_ reduced by the value of notes held by the Presidency banks
at their head offices.[25] For some purposes the _active_ circulation
is the most important. But it is the reserve of rupees held against
the _gross_ circulation which is the best indication of the surplus
volume of coined silver available, if necessary, for the purposes of
circulation. The following table gives for various years the average
of the circulation on the last day of each month:—

currency notes are very simple. A certain fixed maximum, the amount of
which is determined from time to time by law, may be held invested,
chiefly in Government of India rupee securities. Up to 1890 the
invested portion of the reserve amounted to 600 lakhs (Rs. 600,00,000).
This was increased to 700 lakhs in 1891, to 800 lakhs in 1892, to 1000
lakhs in 1897; to 1200 lakhs, of which 200 lakhs might be in English
Government securities, in 1905; and to 1400 lakhs (£9,333,000), of
which 400 lakhs (£2,666,000) might be in English securities, in 1911.
The interest thus accruing on the invested portion of the reserve,
less the expenses of the Paper Currency Department, is credited to the
general revenues of the Government under the head “Profits of Note
Circulation.” This interest now amounts to £300,000 annually.

Up to 1898 the whole of the rest was held in silver coin in India.
Under the Gold Note Act of 1898 the Government of India obtained
authority to hold any part of the metallic portion of the reserve in
gold coin. An Act of 1900 gave authority to hold part of this gold
in London; but this power was only intended to be used for purposes
of temporary convenience, and, although some gold was held in London
in 1899 and 1900, this was not part of a permanent policy. An Act of
1905, however, gave full power to the Government to hold the metallic
portion of the reserve, or any part of it, at its free discretion,
either in London or in India, or partly in both places, and also in
gold coin or bullion, or in rupees or silver bullion, subject only to
the exception that all coined rupees should be kept in India and not
in London. The actual figures, showing where the gold reserve has been
held at certain dates, are given below.

                  ===========

11. Gold was originally accumulated in the reserve in India through
the automatic working of the rule by which rupees could be obtained
in exchange for sovereigns. After exchange touched par in 1898, we
see from the above table that gold began to flow in. When in 1900 the
accumulations reached £5,000,000, attempts were made, in accordance
with the recommendations of the Fowler Committee, to force it into
circulation.[26] After the comparative failure of this attempt, and
the passing of the Act of 1905, as described above, the Paper Currency
Chest in England was instituted, and by 1906 about two–thirds of the
gold which had been accumulated up to that time was transferred to this
fund. This stock is kept at the Bank of England, but is not included in
the Bank of England’s own reserve. Gold which is thus transferred is
said to be “ear–marked.” The fund is under the absolute control of the
Secretary of State for India in Council, and transferences to it are,
so far as the accounts of the Bank of England are concerned, reckoned
as exports. Policy as to how much of the gold should be kept in London
and how much in India has fluctuated from time to time. I shall discuss
it in Chapter VI.

12. These are the chief relevant facts of law. Important considerations
of policy do not lie so plainly on the surface. Since 1899 the
circulation of notes has more than doubled, but the invested portion
of the reserve has been increased by only 40 per cent. As the note
issue has become more firmly established and more widely used, a
growing and not a diminishing proportion of the reserves has been kept
in liquid form. This is due to a deliberate change of policy, and
to the use of the liquid part of the reserve for a new purpose. The
bullion reserve is no longer held solely with the object of securing
the ability to meet the obligation to cash notes in legal tender
(rupees or gold) on demand. It is now utilised for holding gold by
means of which the Secretary of State can support exchange in times of
depression and maintain at par the gold value of the rupee. For the
sake of this object the Government are content to forego the extra
profit which might be gained by increasing the investments, and have
steadily increased instead (as shown in the table on p. 49) the gold
portion of the reserve. The Paper Currency Reserve is thus used to
provide the gold which is the first line of defence of the currency
system as a whole, and hence can hardly be distinguished from the
resources of the Gold Standard Reserve proper.

It is not profitable to discuss the reserve policy of the Paper
Currency under existing conditions in isolation from the other reserves
which the Government now hold. The whole problem of the reserves,
regarded as a current practical question, is dealt with in Chapter VI.
In this chapter I wish to look at the matter from a broad standpoint,
with an eye to the proper policy in a future, possibly remote.

13. The present policy was designed in its main outlines at a time when
notes formed an insignificant part of the country’s currency, and when
the system of circles still greatly restricted their usefulness. The
notes were at first, and were intended to be, little more than silver
certificates. The rules governing the Reserve were framed (see § 3) at
a time which, to the modern student of currency, is almost prehistoric,
under the influence of the Bank of England’s system of note issue and
of the British Bank Act,—an Act which had the effect of destroying
the importance of notes as a form of currency in England, and which it
has been found impossible, in spite of some attempts, to imitate in
the note–using countries of Europe. As has been urged in Chapter II.,
England is in matters of currency the worst possible model for India;
for in no country are the conditions so wholly different. A good deal
of experience with regard to note issues has now been accumulated
elsewhere which ought some day to prove useful to India if her English
rulers can sufficiently free themselves from their English traditions
and preconceptions. Let me first give a short account of the nature of
the seasonal demand for money in India; and then discuss the salient
respects in which her system of note issue differs from those of
typical note–using countries.

14. In contrast to what happens in the case of most note systems, the
_gross_ circulation in India diminishes instead of increasing during
the busy seasons of autumn and spring. This is due to the fact that the
Government Treasuries, the Presidency Banks, and possibly other banks
and large merchants, use the notes as a convenient method of avoiding
the custody of large quantities of silver during the slack season when
rupees are not wanted.[27] That is to say, they deposit their surplus
rupees during the summer in the Currency Reserve, holding their own
reserves in the form of notes; and when the drain of rupees begins up
country for moving the crops these notes have to be cashed. Thus in
the dull season currency is largely in the hands of a class of persons
and institutions which finds it most convenient to hold it in the form
of notes, and in the busy season it is dissipated through the country
and is, temporarily, in the hands of smaller men—cultivators who have
sold their crops, small moneylenders and others, who habitually deal in
small sums for which the rupee is the most convenient unit, or who do
not yet understand the use of notes and still prefer, therefore, to be
paid in actual coin.

15. Notes themselves, however, are used also, and to an increasing
extent, for moving crops; and, although the _gross_ circulation
falls during the busy season for the reasons just given, the _active_
circulation (_i.e._, excluding the holdings of the Government
Treasuries and the Presidency Banks) does, as we should expect,
_increase_ at this time of year. When, therefore, we are considering
what proportion of liquid reserves ought to be maintained, or what part
the note issue plays in supplying the much needed element of elasticity
in the busy season, it is of the active rather than of the gross
circulation that we must take account. The figures are given below in
lakhs of rupees:—

Columns(1): Active circulation. Columns(2): Holdings of Treasuries and
Presidency Banks, _i.e._, _excess_ of gross over active circulation.

  (a) An abnormal year.

We see, therefore, that, while the notes held by the Presidency Banks
and the Treasury fall in the busy season by 700 to 1000 lakhs below
their highest figure in the slack season, the _active_ circulation
_increases_ in the busy season over its lowest figure in the slack
season by about 400 lakhs (in the latest year for which we have
figures, 1911–1912, by more than 600 lakhs). Of course this is not a
very high proportion of the total increase in the volume of currency
which is required in the busy season. But it is an amount well worth
considering, and these figures put the note issue in a more favourable
light as a source of currency in the busy season than is usually
realised. The relative importance of notes and rupees[28] in supplying
the seasonal needs of trade is well shown in the following table:—

(a) In this table rupees (but not notes) in the Presidency Banks are
treated as being in circulation. It would be a troublesome piece of
work to exclude them, and would make, I think, very little difference
to the result. The main variable element in the reserves of the
Presidency Banks is the notes, and these are duly allowed for in the
above table.

The above table is exceedingly instructive. It shows that the notes
supply an increasingly important proportion of the seasonal demand for
additional currency. It shows also that the demand for notes from one
year to another has been of a steadier character than the demand for
rupees. In the period of depression from the winter of 1907 until
the autumn of 1908 the active rupee circulation was much harder hit
than the active note circulation; for in the six months January to
June 1908 the rupee circulation fell by 1468 lakhs, while the active
note circulation fell by 294 lakhs, and for the nine months January to
September 1908 the former fell by 2186 lakhs, while the latter fell by
only 96 lakhs.[29]

16. Let me now turn to three salient characteristics, all closely
connected with one another, and chiefly distinguishing the Indian
system of paper currency from those of most note–using countries.

In the first place, the function of note–issue is wholly dissociated
in India from the function of banking. To discount bills is one of the
functions of banks. Where there are Central Banks with the right of
note issue, they are usually able, subject to various restrictions, to
increase their note issue at certain seasons of the year in order to
discount more bills.

In the second place, as there is no Central Bank in India, there is
no Government Banker. It is true that the Government keep some funds
(rather more than £2,000,000, as a rule) at the three Presidency Banks.
But the bulk of their floating resources is held either in London
or in cash in their own Treasuries in India. Thus, as in the United
States, the Government maintains an independent Treasury system. This
means, just as it does in the United States, that, at certain seasons
of the year when taxes are flowing in fastest, funds may sometimes be
withdrawn from the money market. The difficulty and inconvenience to
which this system has given rise in the United States are well known
to those who are acquainted with the recent financial history of that
country. The ill effects of it are to a certain extent counteracted,
in the case of India, by a transference of these funds to London and
a release of the accumulating currency in India through the sale of
Council Bills. But this is not a perfect solution.

The third and most important point arises out of the first two. The
Indian currency is internally (_i.e._, apart from the import of funds
from foreign countries) absolutely inelastic. There is no method
whatever by which the volume of currency can be _temporarily_ expanded
by some credit device _within_ the country to meet the regularly
recurrent seasonal demands of trade. Cheque–using countries meet the
difficulty by increasing the volume of credit created by the banks;
most note–using countries meet it by the Central Bank’s discounting
a greater volume of home bills than usual, and thus increasing its
note circulation temporarily, without a corresponding increase in its
metallic reserves. Except for a certain proportion of the business
which is transacted by cheque (chiefly in the Presidency towns), there
is nothing corresponding to this in India. Additional currency,
whether notes or rupees, can be obtained in two ways only—by buying
Council Bills in London or by bringing in sovereigns. Additional notes
or rupees can be obtained in payment of Council Bills or in exchange
for sovereigns, but not otherwise. The fact that a temporary increase
in the media of exchange can only be obtained by bringing in funds from
abroad partly explains the high rate of discount in India during the
busy season. This question will be more fully dealt with in Chapter
VIII. But the main point can be put briefly thus:—If funds are to be
attracted from abroad for a short period (say three months), the rate
of interest must be high enough to repay the cost of remittance _both_
ways, which in the case of places so remote from one another as India
and London is considerable. If there were some authority which could
create credit money in India during the busy season, it would not be
necessary for the rate of discount to rise so high.

17. The objections to the existing arrangements largely arise,
therefore, out of the absence of a State Bank. This question is further
discussed in Chapters VI. and VII. I feel little doubt that India
ought to have a State Bank, associated in a greater or less degree
with the Government. The Government is drifting year by year into
doing more business of an essentially banking character; and as time
goes on it will become increasingly objectionable to dissociate some
of the functions of modern State Banking from others. But there is a
considerable weight of opinion in favour of the view that the time for
the establishment of a Central Indian Bank is not yet ripe. In the
meantime is any partial remedy possible for the evils dealt with above?

18. I am inclined to think that such a remedy is possible. The manner
in which the reserve against the note issue must be kept is needlessly
restricted. Apart from that portion which is permanently invested, the
whole must be kept in gold and silver. This is in imitation of the
rules governing the Bank of England’s note–issue. But the note–issuing
banks of Europe afford a better model. It might be proper to prescribe
by law the holding of a certain proportion of the reserve (say
one–third[30]) in gold or silver coin. A further amount might be held,
as at present, permanently invested in Government of India securities.
With regard to the rest the Government should, I think, permit itself
much greater latitude. It should be free to lend it out on suitable
security, either in India or London, for periods not exceeding three
months. In London it should be lent out on the same conditions as the
Cash Balances and the Gold–Exchange Standard (see Chapter VI.) are lent
out at present. To lend in London would be technically convenient (for
the reasons given on p. 172), but it would not cure the inelasticity
of the Indian system. Part of the reserve should, therefore, be lent
out _in India_. Suitable security for this purpose would be Government
of India securities (which would have indirectly the effect of
increasing the market for Rupee Paper) and Bills of Exchange of the
highest class. It is not worth while to discuss here in detail the
precise methods which it would be proper for the Government to adopt in
lending out funds in India either from the Cash Balances or from the
Paper Currency Reserve. Whether it were done through the Presidency
Banks only, or whether an approved list of borrowers of Government
funds were to be drawn up for India as is already the case for London,
the effect on the Indian Money Market would be much the same. The
needed element of elasticity would be obtained, and the present
absolute dependence of India on London for an expansion of currency
would be modified. I shall return to this proposal again in Chapters
VI. and VIII. Its full force cannot be shown until we have discussed
the question of the Secretary of State’s reserves as a whole, and have
studied in detail the movements of the Indian bank rate.

A good deal of opinion has been expressed in India lately in favour
of loans being made there from the Government’s Cash Balances. In so
far as this opinion demands some new machinery by which on suitable
occasions the Government can lend out funds in India herself, the
evil which it seeks to remedy is a real one. And the method proposed
above is, I believe, the right way in which to approach the problem’s
solution.

19. The discussion of this question will be concluded in Chapters VI.,
VII., and VIII. But it will be well to say a few words at once with a
view to avoiding misunderstandings on two points. It has been necessary
in the immediate past to use the Paper Currency Reserve as a part of
the general reserves held for ensuring the absolute stability of the
rupee. I do not advocate the lending out in India of any part of this
reserve, or of the Cash Balances, at the expense of the stability of
the Gold Standard, or until adequate measures can be taken in other
ways to ensure this. But I think the time has practically arrived when
the whole of the liquid portion of the Paper Currency Reserve is not
required, in addition to the Gold Standard Reserve proper, for this
purpose. A busy season will soon come when the Government might lend
some part of its reserves in India without endangering in the least the
stability of its system and to the great advantage of Indian trade. It
ought, at least, to have the power to do this.

20. The remaining point is this. A provision of the above kind for
introducing some degree of elasticity into the Indian currency system
would not be very useful in a season such as that of the autumn and
winter of 1905–6 or of the autumn of 1912–13, when there was a demand
for rupees on so great a scale that it could only be met from the
Mint. Additions to the currency of this kind can only be made by
importing funds from abroad. But these are permanent not temporary
additions. Every such addition makes a similar demand for new coinage
in succeeding seasons less likely. They are abnormal, and recent
history seems to show that these permanent additions to the Indian
currency are not made by slow and steady accretions year by year, but
in great bursts of activity at considerable intervals. In years of
normal activity, therefore, there may be considerable stores of rupees
lying idle in the reserves beyond what is required for the safety
of the currency. Indian bankers and merchants can only get at these
rupees, so as to obtain a net addition to the currency, by buying
sovereigns or Council Bills in London. If the use for the additional
currency is only temporary, the cost of transport or remittance is
great enough to make it not worth their while to get this addition
until the Indian rate of discount has been forced up to a high level.
If the Government were free on such occasions to lend out some part of
the rupees, against high–class security, at 5 or even 6 per cent, this
would be profitable to the Government, and would prevent the discount
rate from reaching a level which is caused, not by anxiety, but merely
by the expense arising out of the distance between London and Calcutta.




CHAPTER IV

THE PRESENT POSITION OF GOLD IN INDIA AND PROPOSALS FOR A GOLD CURRENCY


1. The Fowler Committee of 1898 avowed themselves in favour of the
ultimate establishment of a gold _currency_ in India as well as a gold
_standard_. Paragraph 54 of their Report runs as follows:—

 We are in favour of making the British sovereign a legal tender and
 a current coin in India. We also consider that, at the same time,
 the Indian mints should be thrown open to the unrestricted coinage
 of gold on terms and conditions such as govern the three Australian
 branches of the Royal Mint. The result would be that, under identical
 conditions, the sovereign would be coined and would circulate both
 at home and in India. Looking forward as we do to the effective
 establishment in India of a gold standard and currency based on the
 principles of the free in–flow and out–flow of gold, we recommend
 these measures for adoption.

The first part of their proposal was carried out immediately, and, in
1899, British gold was declared legal tender at the rate of a sovereign
to 15 rupees. It appeared at first as if their further object of a gold
currency might soon be attained also. The principle of minting gold in
India was accepted both by the Secretary of State and by the Viceroy’s
Council, and in 1900 Sir Clinton Dawkins actually announced that it
had been decided to constitute a branch of the Mint at Bombay for this
purpose. In the meantime an attempt was made, described in §4, to force
sovereigns into circulation. But the attempt failed, and Sir Clinton
Dawkins’s proposal was never carried out. As Sir G. Fleetwood Wilson
explained in the Legislative Council in 1911—

 A number of technical and other difficulties were raised by the
 Royal Mint, which ultimately wore out the patience of Lord Curzon’s
 Government. In the interval the Kolar gold mining companies had mostly
 entered into agreements for the sale of their produce in England; and
 the prospect of their bringing their gold to be refined and coined
 at Bombay—which was to be the _pièce de résistance_ of our gold
 mint—was thus deferred. In the circumstances it was decided in 1902
 to drop the project, and to wait until a stronger demand for a local
 gold coinage should arise.

This account of the matter, however, scarcely does justice to the part
played by the British Treasury in defeating the project. The official
correspondence lately published,[31] shows that for two years (from
1899 to 1901) they made, as Sir G. F. Wilson states, a succession of
technical difficulties in a spirit of scarcely veiled hostility to the
whole proposal. But eventually (in May 1901) a scheme was arranged,
acceptable both to the Mint at home and to the authorities in India.
At this point in the negotiations the natural instincts of the Treasury
officials became uncontrollable, and respect for the independence of
the India Office had to be abandoned. Their first line of defence in
the form of technical difficulties having been overcome, they fell back
upon open argument as to the wisdom from the Indian point of view of
the whole project:—

 While expressing their satisfaction that an agreement has now been
 reached, my Lords think it desirable, before practical steps are taken
 to carry out the scheme, to invite Lord George Hamilton to review
 the arguments originally advanced in favour of the coinage of the
 sovereign in India, and to consider whether the course of events, in
 the two years which have elapsed since the proposal was made, has
 not tended to diminish their force, and to render such advantages as
 are likely to accrue from the establishment of a branch mint wholly
 incommensurate with the expense to be incurred.... The gold standard
 is now firmly established, and the public requires no proof of the
 intention of the Indian Government not to go back on their policy,
 which is beyond controversy. Sovereigns are readily attracted to India
 when required under existing conditions.... On the other hand, the
 estimates of the Government of India of gold available for coinage in
 that country are less than was anticipated, nor is any considerable
 increase expected, at any rate for some time.... The staff would
 have to be maintained in idleness for a large part of the year at
 considerable cost to the Indian Exchequer.... It is of course for Lord
 George Hamilton to decide whether, in spite of these objections, the
 scheme is to be proceeded with.

The India Office answered thus:—

 The establishment of a mint for the coinage of gold in India is the
 clearest outward sign that can be given of the consummation of the
 new currency system; and to abandon the proposal now must attract
 attention and provoke criticism and unrest.... His Lordship is not
 inclined to abandon the scheme at the stage which it has now reached.

The Treasury’s reply was cogent:—

 My Lords cannot believe that the position of the gold standard in
 India will be strengthened, or public confidence in the intentions
 of the Government confirmed, by providing machinery for obtaining
 gold coins which is neither demanded nor required by the mercantile
 community; while, on the other hand, the failure or only partial
 success of a gold mint would undoubtedly be pointed to by the
 opponents of the gold standard policy (although without justification)
 as evidence of the breakdown of that policy.

The Treasury’s arguments were, as they deserved to be, successful.
After consultation with the Government of India, who drew attention to
the agreements (referred to by Sir G. F. Wilson above) entered into by
the mining companies, the Secretary of State agreed (Feb. 6, 1903) to
the project’s indefinite postponement. “No public explanation was given
in India of this sudden recession from what has hitherto been regarded
as an essential feature of the currency policy inaugurated in 1893 and
definitely established on the recommendations of the Currency Committee
of 1898.”[32]

2. From 1903 up to 1910 little was heard of proposals for an active
encouragement of the circulation of gold. But the intention had never
been repudiated, and in the Budget debate of 1910 Sir James Meston,
then Financial Secretary to the Government, spoke as follows:—

 The broad lines of our action and our objects are clear and
 unmistakable, and there has been no great or fundamental sacrifice of
 consistency in progress towards our ideal. Since the Fowler Commission
 that progress has been real and unbroken. There is still one great
 step forward before the ideal can be reached. We have linked India
 with the gold countries of the world, we have reached a gold–exchange
 standard, which we are steadily developing and improving. The next
 and final step is a true gold currency. That, I have every hope, will
 come in time, but we cannot force it. The backwardness of our banking
 arrangements, the habits and suspicions of the people, the infancy of
 co–operation—all stand in the way. But the final step will come when
 the country is ripe for it. I trust that will not long be delayed;
 for when it comes, it will obliterate all the mistakes, all the
 inconveniences, all the artificialities, of our present position.

In March 1911 matters were carried a step further, Sir Guy Fleetwood
Wilson replying in the Legislative Council to Sir Vithaldas Thackersey
(who had argued that a 10–rupee gold coin ought to be minted and put
into active circulation in India) that “much has happened since 1902
which justifies the reopening of the question.” In a despatch to
the Secretary of State, dated May 16, 1912, the Government of India
proposed to open the Bombay Mint to the coinage of sovereigns. This is
an exceedingly confused document. It is mainly directed to showing that
an increased use of gold as currency in India would be advantageous to
the system. But, apart from the validity of this argument, it is not
clearly shown in what way the establishment of a mint would effect the
desired purpose; indeed it is explicitly admitted that “in proposing to
open a gold mint it is not our intention to induce thereby an increased
flow of gold to India. Indeed were that our purpose we recognise
that it would certainly fail.” The despatch reads as though it were
an attempt to reconcile divergent and contradictory views which had
received expression. The British Treasury, however, has again come to
the rescue. They have stipulated either that the branch mint should
be under Imperial management, which would be inconvenient, or that it
should be wholly separate, which would be expensive. Accordingly, in a
despatch, dated October 18, 1912, the Secretary of State suggested to
the Government of India that instead of sovereigns Indian gold coins
of the nomination of, say, 10 rupees should be coined at Bombay. The
Government of India have replied that they prefer this proposal to the
conditions demanded by the Treasury, and that they contemplate making
inquiries as to Indian opinion on it. This is how the matter stands at
present.

The actual policy of the Government of India since 1900 as regards gold
currency has been, in my opinion, well judged. But these negotiations
show that the authorities are still doubtful as to the advantages of
the existing system.

3. Up to 1870 the English currency system was the envy of the rest
of the world, and it was supposed that the excellencies of the
practical working of this system were due to the fact that the actual
circulating medium of the country was gold. This, it was thought,
must be the only really safe way of maintaining absolute stability.
Germany, accordingly, when she instituted her gold standard, prohibited
the issue of notes of a less denomination than 100 marks, in order
that gold might actually circulate from hand to hand to a maximum
possible amount. For similar reasons the business community showed
themselves immovably hostile to Lord Goschen’s proposals for the
issue of one–pound notes in England. While other countries, who have,
with few exceptions, found the expense of a gold medium of exchange
prohibitively heavy, have nevertheless envied those who could afford
it, and have adapted their laws, even when they could not afford to
adapt their practice, to a currency of gold.

But in recent years the evolution of currency has, for reasons which
I have elaborated in Chapter II., embarked upon a new stage of
development, and all this is changed. In England the use of a cheque
currency has grown so universal that the composition of the metallic
coin has become a matter of secondary importance. In Germany the
policy of 1876 has been deliberately reversed by a recent revision of
the Bank Act, and 20–mark notes are now issued with the deliberate
object of keeping as much gold as possible in the bank and wasting as
little as possible in circulation. This new policy is likely to be
extended in the future. The President of the Reichsbank, addressing the
Budget Committee of the Reichstag in January 1913, argued that the rule
laid down in 1906, forbidding the free issue of 20–and 50–mark notes to
an amount exceeding £15,000,000, would have to be repealed, the issue
of these notes in 1912 having exceeded the limit by £11,500,000; and
he went on to say that they must, in the interests of sound policy,
increase the issue of notes and thus hold a larger quantity of gold in
their reserves.

In other countries, where actual currency is the principal medium of
exchange, the attempt to introduce gold as the medium passing from
hand to hand has been for the most part abandoned. A great part of
the new gold has flowed, during the last ten years, into the reserves
of the State Banks, and a comparatively small amount only can have
found its way into circulation. In Austria–Hungary, for example,
after the currency reform of 1892, attempts were made to force gold
into circulation just as they were in India. They luckily failed. The
authorities of the Austro–Hungarian Bank now keep all the gold they
can in their central reserves, and they are not likely to make another
attempt to dissipate it. The same kind of thing occurred in Russia.
After establishing with difficulty a gold standard, they began with
the theory, and have since abandoned it, that a gold currency was the
natural corollary. Other examples could be given. A gold standard is
the rule now in all parts of the world; but a gold currency is the
exception. The “sound currency” maxims of twenty or thirty years ago
are still often repeated, but they have not been successful, nor ought
they to have been, in actually influencing affairs. I think I am right
in saying that Egypt is now the only country in the world in which
actual gold coins are the principal medium of exchange.[33]

The reasons for this change are easily seen. It has been found that
the expense of a gold circulation is insupportable, and that large
economies can be safely effected by the use of some cheaper substitute;
and it has been found further that gold in the pockets of the people
is not in the least available at a time of crisis or to meet a foreign
drain. For these purposes the gold resources of a country must be
centralised.

This view has long been maintained by economists.[34] Ricardo’s
proposals for a sound and economical currency were based on the
principle of keeping gold out of actual circulation. Mill (_Political
Economy_, Bk. III. chap. xxii. § 2) argued that “gold wanted for
exportation is almost invariably drawn from the reserves of banks, and
is never likely to be taken from the outside circulation while the
banks remain solvent.” While Goschen spoke as follows in 1891 before
the London Chamber of Commerce:—

 We only have as an effective circulation that which is required for
 the daily wants of the people. You cannot tap that to any extent so
 as to increase your central stock of gold. You may raise your rate of
 interest to 6 per cent or 8 per cent, but the bulk of the people will
 not carry less gold in their pockets than they did before, and I doubt
 whether, from other quarters, you would be able to get much addition
 to your central store.

But while it is no new theory that gold in the pockets of the people
is absolutely useless for the purposes for which a currency reserve
is held, all but the highest authorities have believed until fairly
recently that no gold standard can be really stable, unless gold
actually circulates in the country. The contrary view was distrusted
by practical financiers, and only of late years has it become powerful
enough to dictate policies. At last, however, Governments have been
converted to it, and it is now as much their anxiety to keep gold out
of circulation and in their reserves as it was formerly the opposite.

A preference for a tangible gold currency is no longer more than a
relic of a time when Governments were less trustworthy in these matters
than they are now, and when it was the fashion to imitate uncritically
the system which had been established in England and had seemed to work
so well during the second quarter of the nineteenth century.

4. Let us now apply these general considerations to the case of India.
In 1900 an attempt was seriously made to get sovereigns into active
circulation, in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee
of 1898. It was decided to pay out gold to the public as soon as
the stock should exceed five millions sterling, and such payments
commenced on January 12, 1900, at the currency offices in Calcutta,
Madras, and Bombay. The instructions issued were to tender gold to
all presenters of notes, but to give rupees if they were preferred.
Later on the Comptroller–General was authorised to send sovereigns to
the larger district treasuries. And in March the Post Offices in the
Presidency towns began to give gold in payment of money orders, and the
Presidency Banks were requested to issue sovereigns in making payments
on Government account. These arrangements continued in force throughout
the financial year 1900–1901, and by March 31, 1901, the amount put
into the hands of the public reached the considerable total of
£6,750,000. But of this amount part was exported, not far short of half
was returned to Government, and it was supposed that the greater part
of the remainder went into the hands of bullion dealers.[35] Further
attempts to force gold into circulation were, therefore, abandoned, and
a large part of the gold which had accumulated in the currency reserve
in India was, a little later on, shipped to England in order to be held
“ear–marked” at the Bank of England.

Since that time the provisions of the Indian system regarding gold (as
already given in Chapter I.) have been as follows:—(1) The sovereign
is legal tender in India at 15 rupees to £1; (2) the Government has
bound itself by Notification to give rupees for sovereigns at this
rate; (3) it is willing, as a rule, to give sovereigns for rupees at
this rate, but is under no legal obligation to do so, and will not
always exchange large quantities.

5. The defeat of the experiment of 1900–1901 was due to a variety of
causes, but mainly, I should suppose, to the long habituation of the
Indian public to the use of silver, and to the unsuitability of the
sovereign, by reason of its high value, for so poor a country as India.

But it is not by any means so certain that an attempt at the present
time to put a 10–rupee gold coin into circulation would not meet with
more success. Its value would be somewhat less. But, more important
than this, the taste of India for gold, as against silver, has been
very considerably developed during the last ten years. It will be worth
while to summarise the available evidence as to the present position of
gold in India.

6. We know, of course, what the annual net addition to the total stock
of gold in India (_i.e._, the imports and the production less the
exports) approximately is—although the amount of the steady leakage
across the land frontiers is usually neglected.[36] We know also how
much of this addition is in the form of sovereigns, and how much in the
form of gold bars. By making allowance, therefore, for the increase or
decrease of sovereigns in the Paper Currency Reserve and the Government
Treasuries, we can calculate how many sovereigns have found their way
each year into the hands of the public. But as to the uses to which
the public put the sovereigns our information is exceedingly vague and
unprecise. By far the most careful and valuable discussions of the
question are to be found in the Reports of the Comptroller–General
of Paper Currency for 1910–11 (written by Mr. R. W. Gillan) and for
1911–12 (written by Mr. M. F. Gauntlett); and I have made free use of
these in what follows. First, it will be useful to have before us the
statistical information referred to above:—

  (a) Since 1908 the whole of this has been held in sovereigns.

  (b) Estimate.

7. The enormous amount of wealth which the Indian people are now
devoting to the barren accumulation of gold is brought out very
strikingly by the figures in the third column. We know that it is
hoarded, used as jewellery, as gilding, even (according to Messrs.
Samuel Montagu) as medicine. But these figures are not relevant to our
present purpose, and we must turn to the figures in the last column,
giving the flow of sovereigns into the hands of the public. What part
of this total is employed for ornament, what part for hoarding, what
part is melted down, and what part is left truly to serve as currency?

In the first place it is estimated that about £1,000,000 “shield”
sovereigns are now imported annually. These are sought after for
purposes of ornament and stand at a premium.[37] It may be safely
assumed, therefore, that they are not used as currency. Further, it
is certain that a large number are melted every year and used as
bullion. There are two causes of this. “As regards melting,” writes Mr.
Gillan,[38] “it is to be noted that for certain purposes the sovereign
has at all times an advantage. Gold being sold in 5–and 10–ounce bars,
if a jeweller wants only a small quantity, a full–weight sovereign
meets his purpose very well, as he knows its exact weight, fineness,
and value, and has no trouble in obtaining it. And the sovereign is
presumably cheaper than the same quantity of gold in out–of–the–way
parts.” There is also another cause, connected with the exchanges;[39]
at some times of year the cheapest way of getting gold is to buy
sovereigns for rupees from the Government. This explanation is borne
out by the fact that there is a steady demand for sovereigns from the
Government’s reserves during the summer months. This is the time when
the exchanges make it most advantageous to get gold in this way, and
when there is least likely to be a demand for sovereigns as a medium
of exchange. Many sovereigns, therefore, are melted. But we should be
making rather a random guess if we were to attempt to say how many.

There must still remain, as the result of recent importations, a
large number of sovereigns retained in the hands of the public in
that form. But we cannot assume that even this reduced total is truly
employed as a medium of exchange. There is a good deal of evidence for
supposing that in some parts of the country sovereigns are displacing
rupees for the purpose of hoards. This may be the case even when in
the first instance the gold is used for currency. The crops may be
sold for gold, because the cultivator wants gold for his hoard. “It is
quite conceivable,” Mr. Gillan points out, “that the acceptance by the
cultivator of gold in payment of his crops is in the nature of barter;
that is to say, he takes the gold not as coin merely but for some other
purpose, and the return of gold in payment of revenue may be no more
than the return of so much as he finds himself unable to retain.”

8. It is clear, then, that we must not fly from a glance at column
(1) of the table on p. 76, or even from a glance at column (5), to
extravagant conclusions as to the present position of the sovereign in
the Indian currency system. Many heavy deductions must be made from the
first totals. What direct evidence is there as to the use of gold as
currency?

“The best indication” (to quote Mr. Gillan again) “of the extent to
which sovereigns have established themselves as a regular part of the
currency, is to be found in the figures of receipts at Post Offices and
Railways.” These have been as follows:—

  (a) Second half–year only.

It has been estimated by the Paper Currency Department[40] that in
1907, as a result of the absorption of earlier years, not less than
two millions were in circulation. But it is supposed that by the end
of 1908 nearly the whole of that amount had disappeared. Owing to
the depression of that year and the low level of the exchanges, the
most profitable employment of the sovereigns was as bullion. This
is strikingly borne out by the almost negligible receipts of gold
(given below) by Post Offices and Railways in 1909–10. Until 1910
the absorption of sovereigns was not sufficient to restore them to a
position of any importance as currency. We have chiefly to consider,
therefore, the imports of sovereigns since 1910. It is from this source
that the sovereigns now circulating as currency are likely to have come.

9. When we proceed to detail, it appears that there are several
important parts of India in which the use of the sovereign is still
negligible—in Bengal, Eastern Bengal, Assam, the Central Provinces,
and Burma. In these provinces it has not begun to make any serious
headway. In the United Provinces (for the purchase of wheat) and in
certain districts of Madras, on the other hand, sovereigns seem to
circulate to some extent, to be received freely by the general public,
and to be increasing, though at no sensational rate. In Bombay and the
Punjab, particularly in the latter, their use is, however, much more
important. Most of the detailed evidence, which is available, refers to
the Punjab; and care must be taken not to apply to the whole of India
opinions from witnesses in that province as to the present position
of gold. The following extract from a resolution passed by the Punjab
Chamber of Commerce on June 4, 1912, is interesting. The Chamber “are
able to state authoritatively that sovereigns are becoming popular and
that their circulation is increasing. They are accepted as legal tender
in the bazaars, and this may be attributed to the intelligence of the
people and to the fact that all over the East (in China and the Straits
Settlements), where the Punjab Sepoys serve in the army and the police,
the sovereign is popular. These men remit their earnings in gold, and
as there is hardly a village in the Punjab that has not sent a man to
these services, it is not surprising that the value of the sovereign
is understood It is difficult to say to what extent sovereigns are
being hoarded, but that they are held up by the well–to–do to a very
considerable amount is undoubtedly the case; and hoarding will continue
among the rural population for years to come. With regard to the
probable effect this importation of sovereigns may have on exchange,
they are of opinion that Government should not rely on the sovereigns
that are being absorbed by the districts in exchange for produce and in
the shape of savings coming out at any time in any appreciable quantity
to support the stability of the rupee.” In 1911–12 the Comptroller
of Currency collected a number of district reports as to the growing
popularity of gold in the Punjab. They completely corroborate the above
summary.

10. Before we pass on to other aspects of the question, a word may be
added with special reference to the very large gold imports of quite
recent date (_i.e._, in 1912). Popular attention has been attracted
by the figures for that year, which are indeed truly remarkable.[41]
The gold imports of 1911–12 and 1912–13 (see table on p. 76) were
noteworthy as compared with those of former years by reason of their
huge aggregate amount; but they were even more noteworthy if regard be
had to the very high proportion of sovereigns.

I do not believe, however, that a conclusion can fairly be drawn
from these figures as to any startling change in the position of the
sovereign in India has experienced two very good seasons and has been
able, therefore, to accumulate savings unusually large extent for
investment in gold ornaments and hoards. Is this altogether inadequate
a partial explanation of the recorded figures? I do not, for the
following reasons, think it is.

In the first place the gold imports for 1911–12 fall short of, and
those for 1912–13 do not much exceed, those for 1910–11 if we exclude
the additions to the Paper Currency Reserve. Imports of gold for
this purpose are, for reasons to be explained in Chapter V., quite
independent of the effective desire of India for gold, and occur merely
because gold happens in some circumstances to be a cheaper means of
remittance to India than Council Bills or any other method. In the
second place the conditions of 1912 were somewhat abnormal on account
of the unusually large supplies of gold which were available from
Australia and Egypt, it is a matter of importing gold from England,
those who want it for bullion purposes will generally find it cheaper
to buy gold bars than to buy gold coin. But if there are sovereigns
on their way from Australia and ready to be diverted to India, or if
there are surplus sovereigns available for export at Alexandria, it
may be a good deal cheaper to buy these sovereign than to get gold
bars from London. The explanation of this, depending on the foreign
exchanges, is fully discussed in Chapter V. I suspect, therefore, that
a higher proportion than usual of the sovereigns imported in 1912 were
put to non–currency uses for which gold bars would have served just
as well. If sovereigns rather than bars are imported _from London_
it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that the importer (since he
must pay a higher price) definitely prefers them. But if sovereigns
are imported from Egypt or Australia rather than bars from London, no
such conclusion can be drawn. Of the £21,500,000 sovereigns imported
into India in 1912 only about £5,000,000 came from London—the rest
from Egypt and Australia.[42] From the gross figures of gold imports
into India in 1912 even heavier deductions than usual must be made,
therefore, before we have an indication of the extent to which
additional sovereigns have really found their way into the currency.[43]

11. Perhaps we may fairly sum this evidence up by saying that it goes
to show the existence in India at the present time of an enormous
demand for gold bullion, a very considerable demand for sovereigns for
purposes of hoarding, and a relatively smaller demand for them, chiefly
confined to the United Provinces, the Punjab, Madras, and Bombay, for
purposes of currency.

Those who think that this tendency to use gold coins should be
further encouraged have advocated three methods of doing so: by
making arrangements for the coinage of sovereigns at Bombay; by the
mintage there of some distinctively Indian coin of the denomination
of 10 rupees; by a deliberate attempt on the part of Government, as
in 1900–1901, to force sovereigns into circulation and to familiarise
parts of the country with them where they are at present unfamiliar,
even to the extent of refusing to issue more rupees on demand.

12. I have placed these proposals in the order of their probable
efficacy to effect their purpose. I see no reason why the first—the
coinage of sovereigns at Bombay—should have any effect at all towards
increasing the use of sovereigns as currency. Four types of occasion
can be distinguished on which gold bars might be presented at Bombay
for coinage:—

(_a_) Gold might be deliberately imported from England for the purpose;
or it might occasionally happen that importers of gold bars, having
temporarily miscalculated the demand for bars, would wish to sell
these bars to the Government.

(_b_) Owners of Indian gold mines might conceivably find it worth their
while to suspend the arrangements they have made in recent years with
English refiners and might sell their gold (about £2,000,000 annually)
to the Bombay Mint. Whether or not they would find it worth while to do
this would presumably depend on the facilities for refining in India
and the terms offered by the Bombay Mint.

(_c_) The habits of the people might be changing, the importation of
new bars from England ceasing, and the people wishing to get rid of the
bars and ornaments they already had.

(_d_) In times of famine or depression the people might sell their bars
and ornaments to the Mint when they were driven to turn their ultimate
resources into money.

Provided the Bombay Mint did not offer to coin on more favourable terms
than the British Mint, which presumably it would not do, it seems
exceedingly unlikely that bar gold would be imported from England on
purpose to be coined in India rather than in England. But if this
were to happen, it would have no consequences worth thinking about.
The place of mintage is a matter of indifference. In all the other
eventualities, suggested above, the gold is brought to the Mint, not to
satisfy a demand for new gold currency, but because the owners of the
gold wish to sell it. The sellers would take payment in sovereigns,
notes, or rupees (since the former can always be exchanged for the
latter), as might suit their convenience. In cases (_c_) and (_d_) the
Government would probably be forced in the end to export the sovereigns
it had itself minted, and to bear the cost of export as well as the
cost of minting.

The chief result of mintage at Bombay, therefore (assuming that the
terms for coming were substantially the same as in England), would be
a small saving of expense to sellers of gold in India. Importers of
gold bars would be saved occasionally a small loss of interest due to
miscalculation; owners of Indian gold mines might conceivably pay, at
the expense of Government, infinitesimally higher dividends; the people
turning their hoards into money would be able to save the expense of
sending the gold to England. A corresponding cost would fall on the
Government, for mintage in the first instance and sometimes for export
afterwards. These consequences, whether desirable or not, have very
little to do with currency questions. The last of them—the making it
easier to turn hoards into money—is very likely desirable. But all
of them could be brought about more cheaply without the establishment
of a Bombay Mint. It would be sufficient if the Government were to
publish terms on which it was ready to buy gold bars. It might be a
real convenience if Government notified its readiness to purchase
bars tendered in India at Rs. 58 annas 5 per ounce[44] (payable in
silver or notes or sterling drafts on London or in sovereigns, on the
present system, if they were available).[45] The Government would be
involved, from time to time, in the cost of export; but this cost it
would have to bear, I believe, just as often if there were a mint,
while the cost of the mint itself would be saved. Such a notification,
as is suggested above, would be much more in the true spirit of the
Indian currency system than the establishment of a gold mint would be;
and it would serve the convenience of the public just as efficiently,
at less expense to Government. The establishment of a Mint, however,
would flatter at small expense an ignorant vanity. The Government by
granting it in response to popular appeal (though I doubt whether, in
fact, there is any such appeal) would have a pleasant feeling of being
democratic on an occasion when to yield involves no more evil than any
other expenditure on a piece of fairly cheap ostentation.

13. To the second proposal for the mintage of a distinctively Indian
gold coin many of the above comments apply equally. But the existence
of a 10–rupee gold piece (13s. 4d.) might very possibly do something
to popularise the use of gold as currency, largely because it would
be of a smaller and therefore more convenient denomination.[46] It is
very difficult to prophesy with regard to the local popularity of a new
coin. On the other hand—apart from the general objections, to be dealt
with later, against popularising gold—it is generally a bad thing
to introduce a new coin and add to the confusion of currencies. For
purposes of export, at times of depression, the 10–rupee piece would
be worth less than two–thirds of a sovereign. The sovereign, moreover,
is fast becoming the international gold coin _par excellence_ far
beyond the bounds of the British Empire. In 1911, 43,305,722 British
sovereigns were minted, or a good deal more than the whole gold coinage
in that year of the rest of the world, viz. £33,375,455. A rival coin
ought not to be set up in India unless some evident advantage is to be
obtained from it.

14. The third policy—that of active measures on the part of Government
to get more gold into circulation—is not likely to be adopted. If it
were, it is difficult to say if it would be successful or not. To force
a coin on people is not always the best way to popularise it; and if
rupees were to be refused, there would probably be a small premium on
them or a small discount on gold—a position which would not help gold.

15. It is probably the case, however, that if it were desirable to
popularise the use of gold, a means could be found of effecting this
in some degree. The main question is whether this is, in fact, the
right policy. Lord Crewe looks forward (see his speech in the House of
Lords, November 14, 1912) “with some confidence to the increased use of
gold currency in India among the people, although it may be a long and
indefinite time before it becomes the habitual and favourite coin in
the country at large.” Ought he to expect this result with satisfaction
as well as confidence?

My own answer to this question is unhesitatingly in the negative. The
principal arguments against such a policy are two,—first, the general
argument that it is extravagant and wasteful to have gold coins as the
actual media of circulation, and second, the argument, more especially
applicable to India, that it would diminish, and not, as its advocates
claim for it, increase the stability of the currency system as a whole.

16. Let us consider first how heavy a loss and expense the popularity
of a gold currency might involve. During the last twelve years the
Government have been able to accumulate a sum of about £21,000,000
sterling from the profits of rupee coinage; and the interest on the
invested portion of the Paper Currency Reserve is now about £300,000
annually. Thus the annual income, derivable from the interest on the
sums set free by the use of cheap forms of currency, amounts already to
about £1,000,000. With the rapidly increasing use of notes, this income
should show a steady growth in the future. Both these sources of profit
would be gravely jeopardised if the introduction of an Indian gold coin
were to meet with any considerable measure of success. It would be
specially unfortunate if a competitor to the paper currency were to be
introduced, before the virtual abolition of the system of circles has
had time to have its full effect in the direction of popularising the
use of notes.

17. Advocates of a gold currency, however, would not, I think, deny
that it might involve the country in some extra expense. They support
their policy on the ground that it would do a great deal to ensure the
stability of the currency system, and that it is worth while to incur
some expense for this object. I think it is possible to show that such
a policy is likely on the whole to have an exactly opposite effect.

It is suggested that the currency should be composed of rupees, gold,
and paper, with rupees still predominating, but consisting of gold in a
considerably higher proportion than at present. This greater infusion
of gold would necessarily be at the expense either of the Currency
Reserve or of the Gold Standard Reserve. If the gold replaced notes,
the former would be diminished, and, if it replaced rupees, the latter.

It is tacitly assumed that the greater part of what has to be withdrawn
from the circulation at a time of crisis would come from the gold
portion of the circulation.

This assumption seems to me to be unwarranted and contrary to general
experience. At a time of crisis it is the fiduciary coins with which
the public are most eager to part. Bankers and others would keep as
much of their surplus currency as they possibly could in the form of
gold, and it would be rupees (in great part) and not gold that would be
paid into the Government Treasuries.

Thus the infusion of more gold into the circulation would necessarily
weaken the existing reserves and would not correspondingly reduce the
amount of such reserves which Government ought in prudence to keep.
When it became necessary to contract the volume of currency, Government
would be in a _worse_ position than at present, unless the greater part
of what was withdrawn came from the gold portion of the circulation and
not from the rupee or paper portion. This is not an expectation upon
which it would be prudent to act.

I have already quoted the late Lord Goschen’s authority in support of
the centralisation of gold reserves. A further passage from the address
he delivered on the same occasion (in proposing a scheme of one–pound
notes for England) is relevant here:—“I would much prefer for national
and monetary purposes to have £20,000,000 of gold under our command
at the Bank of England than 30,000,000 sovereigns in the hands of the
public.... If the issue (of one–pound notes) took place, and were taken
up, we should have £20,000,000 more _central_ gold—an immeasurably
stronger reserve than 30,000,000 sovereigns on which we could not place
our hands.”

18. There are, in fact, two ways of maintaining stability in a country
whose demand for currency varies widely from year to year—_either_
it must consist almost _wholly_ of gold, or a sufficient reserve must
be _concentrated_ in the hands of Government. If only one–quarter or
one–fifth of the circulation consists of gold, I do not think that a
Government can rely on getting more than a _fraction_ of this, when
it becomes necessary to contract the circulation by one–sixth or
one–seventh; whereas if the gold is in the Government’s reserves, the
_whole_ of it is available.

For obvious reasons of convenience and of economy the greater part of
the Indian circulation must continue in any case to consist of rupees.
It is vain to suppose that the advantages of a true gold currency can
be obtained by the compromise of somewhat increasing the gold element.
If the Government dissipates some part of its sterling resources over
the country—and any proposal for a greater infusion of gold into the
currency amounts to this—it must plainly stand in a weaker position to
meet a crisis than if they are concentrated in its own chests.

19. The encouragement of gold, therefore, would involve expense, and,
at the same time, diminish safety. There is a further argument against
it, connected nevertheless with the above, which is of great importance.

If gold were to supplant rupees only and not notes, and were to
supplant them to so great an extent that sovereigns would tend to flow
out of the currency at times of depression, there might be something to
be said for it. It is certainly the case that it is a disadvantageous
thing for India to have so large a part of her currency in the form
of expensive tokens,—the issue of rupees strengthens the reserves
by less than a half of their nominal value. The degree of damage to
the Government’s reserves, therefore, would be much less if the gold
were to supplant rupees than if it were to supplant notes. But this is
most unlikely to be the case. It is for comparatively large payments
that the sovereign may gradually come into use, and for these it is
essentially a rival to the note. For small payments, which in India
make in the aggregate an enormous total, the sovereign can no more
supplant the rupee than it can supplant the shilling in England.

Reports collected by the Comptroller of Currency in 1911–12 already
show in a striking way the tendency of gold to take the place which
is, or might be, occupied by notes. The rapidity with which gold is
becoming popularised in the Punjab is probably due in very great part
to the fact that notes have never become acclimatised there.[47] The
inconvenience of making large payments in silver is obvious;[48] and
facilities for obtaining gold are naturally welcomed. The events of the
last two or three years may have done very great harm in the direction
of postponing the development of the use of notes in Northern India. In
Bengal and Eastern Bengal, on the other hand, the slow progress made by
gold is to be explained by the fact that the people of these provinces
are much more accustomed to the use of notes, which are even used in
some cases for the purpose of hoarding (cf. p. 165). If the Government
were to attempt to further in any way the circulation of gold in the
Bengals, they would be aiming a dangerous blow at their own note issue;
whereas if notes could be encouraged in place of rupees in the jute
trade, there would be a huge increase in their circulation. It is also
reported that the use of gold in the rice trade in Burma would displace
notes mainly. The following quotations from the reports (collected in
1911–12 by the Comptroller of Currency from districts in the Punjab),
referred to above, illustrate the point that gold is preferred to
silver because it is more convenient to carry, and that notes are
distrusted because there is no universally spread assurance of their
ready convertibility.[49]

 _Gujranwala._—The zamindar prefers to have his price for the grain
 in gold, as he can easily carry it and easily exchange it and, if
 necessary, easily put it away. He shies at currency notes of any
 value, as they cannot be easily exchanged, and to receive payment in
 silver means cost of carriage and a greater risk of being robbed.
 Contractors of the Canal Department are very glad to receive payment
 of their cheques in gold. Some have remarked that sovereigns can be
 exchanged even in the village most remote from civilisation, but
 notes, even of the value of Rs. 5, are looked upon with distrust by
 the village yokel and even by the village sahukar. With a sovereign
 there is no trouble, no awkward questions are asked and no discount
 taken.

 _Jhang._—The people prefer gold because it is less troublesome than
 silver money.

 _Gurdaspur._—The facility of transit is the reason why corn merchants
 prefer sovereigns to silver.

 _Ambala._—Both in cities and villages, sovereigns are replacing notes
 more than rupees.

 _Bannu._—Gold is slowly but steadily replacing currency notes.

 _Rohtak._—(With the increase of gold) a corresponding decrease in the
 use of currency notes has been observed during 1911–12.

 _Ludhiana._—(With the increase of gold) the issues of notes have
 correspondingly decreased.

These particular statements are corroborated by general statistics. The
most recent statistics of the use of 10–rupee notes in the Punjab and
in Bombay, as compared with Bengal, strongly suggest that the recent
development of gold circulation in these provinces has been at the
expense of these notes. “In the Punjab it is reported (in 1911–12) that
large payments for agricultural produce are never made in notes, and
that gold is replacing notes to some extent even in ordinary payments
among merchants and traders.” In the light of these facts, it is a
wonderful tribute to the enduring power of the “sound” currency maxims
of the middle of last century that responsible officials should have
welcomed the outflow of gold as the salvation of their system.

Before leaving this topic I wish to emphasise, in close connexion with
it, a special reason why it is so important to develop the use of
notes in India at the present time. It is desirable to encourage the
popularity of the note issue, and to avoid encouraging its rivals, not
only for reasons of immediate economy or because, by the centralisation
of the reserves, the stability of the currency is increased, but also
because, in a country where cheques are not likely for many years to
come to be used to a dominating extent, it is only thus that a proper
degree of seasonal elasticity in the currency can possibly be secured.
This question has been already raised in Chapter III., and I shall
return to it again in Chapters VI. and VII.

20. One minor indirect consequence of the existing system is worth
reference. Gold flows into the Currency Reserve when this is a cheaper
way of getting notes or rupees than by buying Council Bills or
Transfers (see Chapter V.). It flows out of the Currency Reserve when
sovereigns are wanted for circulation or for hoarding, or when this is
the cheapest way in which bullion dealers can get gold. There is reason
for thinking that a good deal flows out for the last reason, and it is
the occasion of this outflow which I wish to examine in a little more
detail. The Currency Department publishes figures which show the number
of sovereigns withdrawn from the Treasuries each month. It appears from
these that, while some are withdrawn in the winter months during the
busy season, when the demand for currency and for hoarding (since it is
then that the cultivators sell their crops and realise their savings
in coin) is at its height, there is in the summer also, when it is
most improbable that an extra supply is required for these purposes,
a steady and, in the aggregate, a heavy drain. A brief arithmetical
calculation provides what must, I think, be the explanation of this.
Since the price of bullion in London is (normally) £3:17:9. per oz.,
while the price of sovereigns is £3:17:10½, the bullion import
point of Indian exchange will be a little below the sovereign import
point. Thus when exchange is fairly high, an Indian purchaser of gold
finds it more profitable to buy drafts on London, purchase gold in
the bullion market and ship it to India, than to purchase sovereigns
from the Treasury at 1s. 4d.; but when exchange is low, the reverse is
the case and it is cheaper to get as much gold as the Treasury will
let you have at 1s. 4d. I do not know exactly where the dividing line
comes;[50] but when telegraphic transfers are at 1s. 4⅛d. it is
certainly more profitable to get gold bullion in London, and when they
are at 1s. 4-1/32d. it may pay to get it in India.

These considerations are modified in practice by the fact that many
Indian purchasers of bullion have a preference for small gold bars
which are manufactured in England. Thus these bars are worth more than
an equivalent weight of sovereigns, and consequently importation of
bullion in this form takes place throughout the year. But for many
non–currency purposes sovereigns are as good or nearly as good as other
forms of bullion, and for these purposes the Indian Treasury is the
bullion dealer’s cheapest source of supply when exchange is relatively
low. Thus in the summer months the bullion dealers will always draw
their supplies from the Treasury, so long as the Treasury is willing
to supply them. Whenever, therefore, gold in India is available to
the public throughout the year, the Government will lose during the
summer months whatever amount the bullion dealers require. On every
sovereign thus drawn out, the Government loses about 1½d. For the
gold could have been kept in England by selling bills at a rate more
advantageous than the par of exchange by about this amount. The annual
amount which is drawn out by bullion dealers when gold is available all
the year round is probably not less than £2,000,000. Thus an important
indirect effect of the present practice is to allow bullion dealers in
the summer months to get their gold at the Government’s cost slightly
cheaper than they otherwise could.

21. India, as we all know, already wastes far too high a proportion
of her resources in the needless accumulation of the precious metals.
The Government ought not to encourage in the slightest degree this
ingrained fondness for handling hard gold. By the elimination of both
precious metals, to the utmost extent that public opinion will permit,
from amongst the hoards and the circulation of the country, they ought
to counteract an uncivilised and wasteful habit.

It is interesting to reflect that India’s love of the precious metals,
ruinous though it has been to her own economic development, has
flourished in the past to the great advantage of Western nations. Every
one knows Jevons’s description of India as the sink of the precious
metals, always ready to absorb the redundant bullion of the West and
to save Europe from the more violent disturbances to her price level.
In very recent years, while the South African mines have been reaching
the zenith of their production, she has been fulfilling to perfection
her rôle of sink. Prices have been rising, as it is, much faster
than is healthy and in a way very disadvantageous to such a creditor
nation as Great Britain, to whom large sums fixed in terms of gold are
annually due. It is reasonable to think that without the assistance of
the Indian demand, they would have risen still faster. From its very
short period point of view the City is sometimes cross when this Indian
demand shows itself in an inconvenient week; but if we take a longer
view the Indian demand is, at a time of plentiful gold supply like the
present, a true friend to the City and an enemy of inflation.

On the other hand, if a time comes when Indians learn to leave off
their unfertile habits and to divert their hoards into the channels of
productive industry and to the enrichment of their fields, they will
have the money markets of the world at their mercy. A surfeit of gold
can do at least as much damage as a shortage. During the past sixty
years India is supposed to have absorbed, in addition to her previous
accumulations, more than £300,000,000 of gold (apart from enormous
quantities of silver). We may presume that, if India ceases to demand
fresh gold and begins to disgorge some part of her huge stock, she
will do so gradually. Yet if the change comes at a time of big new
production, she may involve the world, nevertheless, in a very great
inflation of gold prices.

If, however, India is thus to turn the tables on the West, she must
not delay too long. The time may not be far distant when Europe,
having perfected her mechanism of exchange on the basis of a gold
standard, will find it possible to regulate her standard of value on a
more rational and stable basis. It is not likely that we shall leave
permanently the most intimate adjustments of our economic organism at
the mercy of a lucky prospector, a new chemical process, or a change of
ideas in Asia.




CHAPTER V

COUNCIL BILLS AND REMITTANCE


1. Remittance by means of what are termed Council Bills is a feature
peculiar to the Indian system, and is not, so far as I know, to be
paralleled elsewhere. It arises partly from the historical circumstance
that the Government of India is the successor of a trading company,
partly from the necessity under which the Government lies of making
very large annual remittances to England.

2. The Home Charges, that is, the payments which the Government of
India must make _in England_, for interest on debt, pensions, payments
to the War Office, Government stores (not chargeable to capital), etc.,
amount to £19,000,000 or £20,000,000 annually. But the amount which
it is necessary to remit, apart from extraordinary remittances to be
dealt with later, is usually less than this; for the amount of new
capital raised by Government in England usually exceeds their capital
expenditure in this country on repayments and on railway materials,
etc. Thus the amount which it is necessary to remit to England annually
is from £15,000,000 to £18,000,000. Rupees to this amount, being
part of the revenue from taxation, etc., accumulate in the Indian
Treasuries. This value is remitted to England by selling for sterling
in London bills which can be cashed in rupees in Calcutta. Thus the
Government of India pays out rupees in Calcutta when the bills are
presented, and the Secretary of State’s balances at the Bank of England
are swelled by a corresponding amount.

The Government is, therefore, one of the largest dealers in foreign
exchange, and does for itself business, which Colonial Governments, for
example, who have a certain amount of similar transactions to carry
through (though on a far smaller scale), would do through a bank. But
while the Government saves for itself the commission which it would
otherwise have to pay to a bank, it is not, in any real sense, a
competitor with the banks for business. In the first place, it sells
exchange, save in exceptional circumstances, in one direction only.
And in the second place, the Secretary of State’s method of selling
exchange results in his dealing exclusively with the Exchange Banks
and financial houses, and not directly with the trading public. The
Secretary of State is in effect the ultimate source of supply for
bills on India, and the banks, after securing what private bills are
available, even up their demands for remittance to India by buying
bills from him,—provided he is selling them at a rate which makes
this form of remittance cheaper than the alternative one of sending
sovereigns. The method by which these bills are sold is as follows.

3. The bills are offered in London for tender at the Bank of England
every Wednesday morning, the Secretary of State for India in Council
(or, for short, the India Council, whence the name Council Bills)
having previously announced the amount (70 lakhs, say) for which
tenders are invited. There is a reserve price (not published) below
which he will not sell, but this reserve price is seldom operative.[51]
The tenders name the amount tendered for and the number of pence per
rupee which is offered. The total amount of 70 lakhs is then allotted
to the highest bidders, the allotment at the minimum rate accepted
being proportionate to the amount applied for at that rate.

If the demand is large and the minimum rate of allotment high (say 1s.
4–3/32d.), the amount offered for tender the following week (which is
announced at the same time as the result of the previous allotment)
is likely to be increased. In the interval between the allotments on
successive Wednesdays, the Secretary of State is usually willing to
sell what are known as “specials” at a rate 1/32d. higher than the
highest rate of allotment on the preceding Wednesday.

4. It should be added that cash must be paid for the bills in London
as soon as they are allotted; but, on account of the time taken by
the mail, they cannot be changed into rupees at Calcutta for about a
fortnight. A fortnight’s interest is therefore lost, and it is worth
paying extra to obtain what are called “telegraphic transfers,” by
means of which rupees can be obtained at Calcutta almost as soon as the
sovereigns are paid into the Secretary of State’s account at the Bank
of England.

The Secretary of State, therefore, is usually willing to sell
telegraphic transfers at a rate 1/32d. per rupee higher than the rate
for bills.[52] If the purchaser chooses transfers, the effect to him
is that he gets his rupees a fortnight earlier in India and pays for
this privilege a sum equal to 5 per cent on the money for a fortnight.
The question, whether it is worth the purchaser’s while to pay this
extra sum, chiefly depends upon the Indian bank rate, because this
governs the amount of interest which can be gained by having the money
immediately available in India. It may happen, of course, that a
particular bank may have a special urgency for funds in India, or that
the rate for fortnightly loans does not closely agree with the bank
rate. Generally speaking, however, if the purchaser can lend money out
at no higher rate than 3 per cent in India, he will certainly prefer
bills; but if he can lend at 7 per cent in India, it will be more
profitable for him to buy transfers.

Experience accords with these expectations. When the Indian bank rate
is high and the difference of 1/32d. between the two prices is in
force, the demand is almost entirely for transfers. This is convenient
to bankers, and, if he has the rupees waiting in India, profitable to
the Secretary of State.

5. The bills and transfers are made payable at the option of the
purchaser at Calcutta, Bombay, or Madras. The amount drawn on Madras is
relatively small, and Calcutta comes first, with about 45 per cent of
the whole.

6. Up to 1900 the volume of sales of Council Bills in any year was
mainly governed by the amount required to defray the Home Charges,
this amount partly depending on the volume of capital borrowings in
the year. But the sales also fluctuated, though within comparatively
narrow limits in most years, according to the Secretary of State’s
opportunities (depending on the activity of business and the balance
of trade) of selling his bills at a satisfactory rate. Since 1900,
however, the functions of the Council Bill system have been enlarged,
and it has now become a very important part of the general mechanism
for the maintenance of the Gold Exchange Standard.

7. The way in which this has arisen is easily explained. On account
of the provision by which rupees can always be obtained in India in
exchange for sovereigns at the rate of 1s. 4d. per rupee, it can never
be worth while for the banks to buy Council Bills at a price which
exceeds 1s. 4d. by more than the cost of sending gold to India. This
cost varies considerably from time to time, but it seldom exceeds
⅛d. If, therefore, the Secretary of State refuses to sell bills
at less than 1s. 4⅛d., when the banks are requiring to remit to
India, gold will flow. This gold will be presented at the Treasuries
in India to be exchanged for rupees or notes. Thus the only effect of
the Secretary of State’s refusing to sell remittances at a price which
suits the banks is that sterling resources accumulate in his Treasuries
in India instead of in England. This may not be convenient to him.
For example, if the banks are sending gold to India on a large scale
and are exchanging it for rupees, a time may come when this demand
can only be met by minting more rupees; the silver for this must be
purchased in London and the profit on the coinage must be credited
to the Gold Standard Reserve which, for reasons to be discussed in
the next chapter, is kept for the most part in London; thus the gold
has eventually to be shipped back again to England to pay for the
silver and to be credited to the Gold Standard Reserve. In this case
a double loss is involved—the cost of sending the gold to India (for
the Secretary of State could probably have got 1s. 4⅛d. per rupee
if he had sold transfers, whereas if gold flows he gets only 1s. 4d.)
and the cost of bringing it back again, say, 3/32d.; thus a refusal to
sell bills would mean an eventual loss of nearly ¼d. per rupee or
about 1½ per cent. Or, again, the policy of holding some part of the
gold in the Currency Reserve in London for possible use in emergency,
may lead to the Secretary of State’s preferring gold to accumulate in
London rather than in India; otherwise it will have to be sent back
again, in pursuance of this policy, and a double loss incurred, as in
the former case. Lastly, if the Secretary of State has considerable
cash balances in India, it may be worth his while for a time to cash
additional Council Bills out of these, thus in effect transferring his
balances to London. The reasons that may make him inclined to do this
are, first, that to increase the proportion of his cash balances held
in sterling puts him in a stronger position in a case of emergency;
second, that selling Council Bills at a good price now will enable
him to meet the Home Charges later on when he might not be able to
sell his Bills at so good a price (in this case the transference of
cash balances from India to London is only temporary); third, that it
may put him in a stronger position for carrying out impending loan
transactions at the most favourable moment; and fourth, that cash
balances held in London can be made to earn a small rate of interest.

All these considerations being taken into account, it can only be
worth the Secretary of State’s while to refuse to sell bills within the
gold export price, when he deliberately wishes either to increase his
cash balances in India at the expense of his balances in London, or to
replenish that part of the gold portion of the Currency Reserve which
is kept in India.

Thus he will endeavour to make as certain as possible of selling within
the year the amount budgeted for (_i.e._, the Home Charges adjusted
with reference to the probable capital transactions of the year and the
state of the cash balances); but he will sell more than this if the
demand for remittance is so great that, on his refusal to sell, the
price of remittance will rise to the gold export point In the words
of the annual budget, “the _estimate_ of Council drawings is for the
amount necessary to provide for the Secretary of State’s requirements,
but additional bills will be sold if needed to meet the demands of
trade.”

8. Let us sum up the argument so far, and enforce at the same time
the contention, brought up at the end of Chapter I., that the volume
of currency circulating in India does not depend, as some critics
have maintained, on the caprice of the India Office in the amount
of Council Bills that it offers for sale. So far as Council Bills
are sold for the ordinary purposes of remittance of Government funds
from India to London, they are cashed in India out of the general
balances of Government. But when they are sold in larger quantities,
to obviate the necessity of sovereigns being sent, sufficient rupees
are not forthcoming from this source. One expedient is to pay out some
of the rupees in the Paper Currency Reserve or in the silver branch
of the Gold Standard Reserve, and to pay an equivalent sum into the
branches of these reserves which are held in London, “earmarked” at
the Bank of England,[53] or in other sterling forms. If, on the other
hand, the India Council had refused to sell bills freely, gold would
have been exported to India, taken to the Paper Currency Department,
and exchanged for rupees in notes or silver. In either case there
is a similar increase in the volume of currency in India not held
by the Government. The volume of currency which finds its way into
circulation in India is, therefore, quite independent of the Secretary
of State’s action. Exceptional amounts of Council Bills are only sold
when exchange has reached a point at which it is nearly as profitable
to remit gold; and if Council Bills were not sold sovereigns would
go instead (the expense of sending them being lost), for which the
Government of India would have to give rupees in exchange. This point
is important, for it is often assumed in controversy regarding the
currency and its relation to prices that the issue of rupees into
circulation depends in some way upon the amount of Council Bills sold
by the Government, and can, therefore, be expanded or contracted by
them at will, according to the policy of the moment. Broadly speaking,
this is false. Even if the Government were to hasten the flow of
rupees into circulation by selling an exceptional quantity of bills
at a relatively low rate (which would be equivalent to lowering by
a fraction of a penny the normal value of the rupee as measured in
sterling), and were to pursue this policy over a long period, the
permanent effect could be no more than in proportion to the amount by
which they had thus lowered the par value of the rupee in terms of
sterling. This is the amount of their conceivable executive power, if
the Government were to exercise it. In fact, it has not been exercised.

If, however, the stock of rupees in the reserves is running low (for a
considerable quantity of rupees must always be kept there in order to
ensure the ready convertibility of the notes in terms of rupees), and
more Council Bills are sold in London than can be conveniently cashed
in Calcutta in the above ways, more rupees must be issued from the
Mint. The silver out of which they are minted is purchased in England
out of the proceeds of selling the additional Council Bills, and the
surplus due to the fact that rupees are worth more than the silver they
contain, is credited to the Gold Standard Reserve. According to the
present practice the process in these circumstances also is, therefore,
automatic, and the amount of new rupees put into circulation does not
depend on the arbitrary action of the Secretary of State in selling
or withholding Council Bills. If he did not sell bills, sovereigns
would be sent to India, new rupees would have to be coined to meet the
obligation under which the Government of India has placed itself of
giving rupees in exchange for sovereigns on demand, and a great part of
the sovereigns would have to be credited in some form or other to the
Gold Standard Reserve or shipped back to England again to pay for the
silver.

It is true that, if a different practice were adopted (a practice
which was adopted in part in 1907), and if the profits on the coinage
of rupees, instead of being credited to the Gold Standard Reserve,
were turned into rupees and spent by the Government in India on
goods and services (whether for capital or any other purpose), more
rupees would be in circulation for the time being than would have
been the case otherwise. But even in this case the effect on the
volume of circulation must be temporary, so long as the provisions
for the maintenance of the rupee at 1s. 4d. are in operation.
For this additional issue of rupees would, eventually, have the
effect of delaying additional demands for coinage in the future
or of precipitating an occasion for the withdrawal of rupees from
circulation.

While, therefore, it is to a certain extent within the power of
Government (though not at present according to their usual practice)
to urge a certain number of rupees into circulation _more rapidly_
than is necessary, they cannot _permanently_ increase the circulation
without depreciating its gold value, that is, they cannot permanently
increase the circulation beyond what it would otherwise be and at the
same time maintain the rupee at 1s. 4d. It may be added that a release
of rupees from any other reserve, or even a temporary increase in the
amount of capital funds annually raised by Government abroad for use
in India, would have a similar effect to the release of rupees from
the Gold Standard Reserve. But, however all this might be, at present
the Government of India do _not_, in fact, exert such discretionary
powers as they possess for affecting, even temporarily, the volume of
circulation.

9. I have said that the cost of sending gold to India does not
generally exceed ⅛d. per rupee. The Secretary of State has,
therefore, a standing notification (since January 1904) that he will
sell bills at 1s. 4⅛d. Up to January 1900 he undertook to sell
telegraphic transfers at 1s. 4–5/32d. without limit of quantity, and
since that time he has usually been willing to do so.[54] The cost of
sending gold to India depends, however, on complex causes, varying
considerably from time to time, and is often a good deal less than
⅛d. It is not easy, therefore, for the Secretary of State to know
at exactly what price gold will become a serious competitor of bills
as a means of remittance; and not infrequently Council Bills are,
unintentionally, at a price which makes it cheaper to send gold. It
will be interesting to consider briefly the kinds of causes which
influence the gold import point.[55]

10. The expense of remitting gold from one country to another is made
up of insurance, freight, and loss of interest. Even the first item is
sometimes capable of variation. For example, after the recent robbery
of sovereigns in transit from London to Alexandria, the ordinary rate
quoted on gold, consigned by the route (Bremen and Trieste) by which
the stolen gold had been sent, was doubled, rising from 1s. 3d. to 2s.
6d. per cent. Again, on one recent occasion, it was stated that more
gold would have been shipped if it had not been for the fact that the
mail–boat was already carrying a million and a half sterling in gold
and silver, the underwriters requiring a higher premium than usual if
they were to insure a larger sum than this on a single voyage. But if
it is a matter of shipping sovereigns _from England_ the variations in
the cost of insurance and freight are relatively small. The _main_ part
of variation in the gold point arises either out of the possibility of
getting sovereigns _from other sources_, or from variations in the rate
of interest.

These other sources are either sovereigns in transit from Australia or
sovereigns ready for export from Egypt. As India lies between Australia
and England, it is naturally cheaper (mainly on account of the smaller
loss of interest) to send sovereigns from Australia to India than from
Australia to England. Let us suppose that the state of the Australian
exchanges is such that it pays to remit sovereigns from Australia to
London anyhow, and assume, for the sake of simplicity (and without, in
fact, any substantial sacrifice of truth), that the cost of freight
and insurance from Australia to London is the same as from Australia
to India. Now if, when the Australian sovereigns are off India, the
bank which is remitting them can receive cash in London against their
delivery in India, it will get its money at least a fortnight sooner,
and will probably accept, therefore, about 1s. 3–31/32d. in London
for 1s. 4d. delivered in India (1/32d. being the interest on 1s. 4d.
for a fortnight at 5 per cent per annum). Gold bought in this way for
immediate delivery in India is as good as a telegraphic transfer,
_i.e._, is worth 1/32d. per rupee more than Council Bills. If,
therefore, Council Bills are at a price in excess of 1s. 3–15/16d.,
gold about to be shipped from Australia competes with them as a means
of remittance to India. Normally, of course, an Australian bank is able
to get more than 1s. 3–15/16d. for gold delivered in India. I mean
only that the Secretary of State cannot hope to undercut Australian
gold, when it is available for export in large quantities, unless he is
prepared to put down his price for Council Bills to this level. If, in
these circumstances, he wants the gold in England rather than in India,
his cheapest course, therefore, is to buy the gold in transit himself
for delivery in England, selling for it telegraphic transfers at a
suitable rate.[56] This was done on a large scale in 1905–6 and 1906–7.

Surplus gold from Egypt is not capable of undercutting Council Bills
so seriously as surplus gold from Australia; for in this case it
is Egypt which lies between. If we assume, for the sake of precise
illustration,[57] that the cost of sending gold from Egypt to London is
nearly the same as that of sending it from Egypt to India, an Egyptian
bank, about to ship sovereigns in any case, will take any price in
excess of 1s. 4d.[58] paid in London for the delivery in India of the
value in gold of a rupee. This is the extreme case. If Council Bills
are at a higher rate than 1s. 4d., say at 1s. 4–1/16d., the Alexandrian
exchanges may be at a level which makes it profitable to ship gold from
Egypt to India for payment in London, when it is not profitable to ship
gold from Egypt to London. If we still make the above illustrative (but
not exactly accurate) assumption, when Council Bills are at about 1s.
4–1/16d. and the Alexandrian exchange on London below par, Egyptian
gold competes with Councils as a means of remittance to India. Of
course the supply of remittance from this source is usually somewhat
limited; when some Egyptian gold has flowed away to India under the
influence of the above conditions, this is likely to have the effect
of strengthening the Alexandrian exchange, and therefore, by modifying
the conditions, of making the continuance of a flow less likely. The
Egyptian gold is of great practical importance, because the busy season
in Egypt comes rather earlier than the busy season in India, so that in
the winter months the gold which has served the purpose of moving the
crops in Egypt can be sent on to be changed into rupees which are to
serve the same purpose in India. Of the gold, therefore, which flows
from London to Egypt every autumn, very little finds its way back again
to London; what is not kept by the cultivators in Egypt travels on in
due course to India. The precise moment at which this movement takes
place and its extent depend, as we have seen above, on the rate at
which Council Bills are being sold in London, and also upon whether
the Egyptian cotton crop is dealt with late or early. But when towards
the end of their busy season the Egyptian banks find themselves with
more gold than they need, Council Bills must be sold at a relatively
low rate if the flow of this gold to India is to be prevented. The
dealings between the Egyptian and the Indian banks must thus present
very delicate problems of arbitrage.

It is probably within the power of the Secretary of State, if he
wishes, to regulate the flow of gold direct from London to Bombay by
means of the sales of Council Bills. But when gold is available in
Australia or Egypt, the matter is not susceptible of such easy control.

The remaining element which determines the cost of
remittance—variation in the market rate of interest—has been dealt
with already, 1/32d. represents the interest on 1s. 4d. for a fortnight
at 5 per cent per annum. It is easy to calculate how the gold export
point is affected by fluctuations in the market rate of discount in
India on either side of 5 per cent.

11. So far we have been dealing with the upper limit of exchange and
with the results of a heavy demand for Council Bills. The effects at
the lower limit differ in this important respect, that the Government
are under no legal obligation to prevent the depreciation of the
rupee, and have not undertaken to give sovereigns for rupees in the
way that they have undertaken to give rupees for sovereigns. There
is nothing in law, therefore, to prevent exchange from falling
indefinitely. There has been no change in law in this respect since
1895, when exchange actually did fall below 1s. 1d. The Government
has, however, practically pledged its word to do all in its power to
prevent the depreciation of the gold value of the rupee and to prevent
exchange from falling below the lower limit of 1s. 3–29/32d. The
business community would rightly regard it as a breach of faith if the
Government were to permit exchange to fall below this rate, unless all
reasonable resources had been exhausted.

12. We now see how intimately the management of Council Bills and of
Government remittance is bound up with the Gold–Exchange Standard. The
disadvantages from the point of view of regulating a Gold–Exchange
Standard, which arise out of there being no Government bank, are partly
compensated by the Secretary of State’s being the largest dealer in
foreign exchange. By regulating the amount of bills he offers for
tender, he is able to regulate to a great extent the level of exchange.
When exchange is falling below par he can support it by greatly
restricting his offers; and if he cannot get at least 1s. 3–29/32d.
for his bills, he withdraws from the market. In the meantime, of
course, he has payments to make in England, while on the other hand
rupees accumulate in India, as the revenue flows in and no Council
Bills are presented for payment. If the cash balances in London are
not sufficient to stand the drain on them, gold at the Bank of England
may be “un–earmarked” and placed to the Secretary of State’s current
account, rupees in India being transferred at the same time from
the Government balances to the silver portion of the Paper Currency
Reserve—the reverse process from that which has been described already
as the result of exceptionally large sales of Council Bills.

If the Secretary of State’s withdrawal from the market and the
consequent scarcity of bills on India is insufficient to support
exchange at 1s. 3–29/32d., more drastic measures are necessary. The
method adopted on the last occasion of this kind was the offer by the
Government of India in Calcutta of _sterling bills on London_ at the
rate of 1s. 3–29/32d., these bills being cashed in London out of the
Gold Standard Reserve.

These measures were sufficient during the severe crisis of 1908. Their
sufficiency for the future will be discussed in Chapter VI. in dealing
with the Secretary of State’s Reserves.

13. If we turn from the mechanism of remittance to the question of
Government remittance as a whole, this can be explained most clearly
by reference to a hypothetical India Office balance–sheet. The whole
account for the year balances out in some such manner as this:—

The table given above analyses the Home Accounts in a way which
brings out the essential facts more clearly than the Government’s own
published accounts. These actual figures may be compared with the
hypothetical balance–sheet given in § 13.

The principal items of the Home Charges are analysed below. As these
do not vary much from year to year it has been thought sufficient to
give the figures of one recent year, namely, 1911–12. It will be seen
that in that year about £5,000,000 was spent on pensions and leave
allowances, £11,000,000 on debt services, and £2,250,000 on military
services (excluding pensions). Other expenses were of a very small
amount.

CHAPTER VI

THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S RESERVES AND THE CASH BALANCES


1. The Indian authorities have undertaken a double responsibility. They
must be prepared to supply rupees in payment for Council Bills or in
exchange for sovereigns. And on the other hand they must be prepared
also to supply sterling or sterling drafts in exchange for rupees. The
maintenance of the Indian system depends on their ability to fulfil
this double obligation to whatever extent may be required of them.

The objects to be attained are simple, but the methods of the
Government are, largely for historical reasons, exceedingly
complicated. I will discuss, first, the nature of the existing methods;
second, their adequacy for their purpose; third, some proposals for
making them more orderly and intelligible; and lastly, the management
of the cash balances.

2. From the profits of rupee coinage[59] a reserve has been built up
expressly for the purpose of supporting exchange. This is known as the
Gold Standard Reserve. As the reserve is used in practice, not only
for holding sterling reserves but also for holding a part of the rupee
reserve, this title is a misnomer.[60]

For some years after the closing of the Mints no fresh coinage was
undertaken. By 1900 it had become necessary to mint additional rupees,
and from that time until 1907 the profits on coinage rapidly raised
the Gold Standard Reserve to a respectable total. The crisis of
1907–8 made it necessary to withdraw a great number of rupees from
circulation, and no further coinage was necessary on a significant
scale until the autumn of 1912. By October 1912 the aggregate profits
arising from coinage amounted to about £18,600,000. Of this, however,
about £1,100,000 was diverted in 1907 for capital expenditure on
railways—leaving about £17,500,000 for the Gold Standard Reserve.
In addition to this the receipts on account of interest on that part
which was invested amounted to about £3,250,000, against which is to be
set about £1,000,000 depreciation in the value of the investments in
October 1912 as compared with their original cost. Thus at that date
this reserve stood at about £19,750,000, allowing for depreciation.
During the winter of 1912–13 profits on the heavy issues of coinage
caused a further increase, and we may conveniently think of the Gold
Standard Reserve as being worth about £21,000,000 net at the end of
1912.

Of this total the greater part was held in sterling securities—about
£16,000,000 (market price). In recent times the policy has been
followed of holding at least half of this in securities of the most
liquid possible type. On March 31, 1912, £4,500,000 was held in British
Treasury Bills, and £4,735,600 in Exchequer Bonds. Of the rest about
£7,000,000 (face value) was in Consols and other stock guaranteed by
the British Government, and about £1,500,000 (face value) in various
Colonial Government Securities.

Apart from the £16,000,000 thus invested, about £1,000,000 was, at
the end of 1912, lent at short notice in the London Money Market;
about £3,750,000 was held in India in rupees; and £250,000 in gold was
“earmarked” at the Bank of England. The holding of some part in actual
gold in England was an innovation introduced in November 1912.

It has been announced that the Gold Standard Reserve is to be allowed
to accumulate through coinage profits and interest receipts until it
stands at £25,000,000, and that £5,000,000 of this will be held in
gold.[61] It is possible that when this figure has been reached, some
part of its income may be applied to capital expenditure on railways.
This would be a reversion to the policy of 1907–8, since abandoned,
when one–half of the profits of coinage was thus diverted.

The form in which the Gold Standard Reserve is held has been subject to
much criticism. But it will not be useful to consider this until we are
in a position to deal with the reserves as a whole.

3. The second reserve is the Paper Currency Reserve held against the
note issue. The constitution of this has been explained in Chapter III.
The invested portion may not exceed a stated maximum, of which a part
only may be held in sterling securities and the rest must be placed
in rupee securities. The whole of the balance must be held in gold or
silver bullion, rupees, or sovereigns. But the gold may be held either
in London or in India. The actual form in which the Currency Reserve
was held at the end of December 1912 was approximately as follows:—

  Sterling securities                    £2,500,000
  Rupee securities                        6,500,000
  Gold in London                          7,250,000
  Gold in India                          17,500,000
  Rupees in India                         8,500,000
  Silver bullion in India or in transit   1,500,000
                                        ─—————–────
                                        £43,750,000
                                        ─────—————–

4. The Government’s remaining reserve source of supply of cash in the
form of rupees or sterling is the Cash Balances. Both the total of
these and the proportions held in rupees and sterling respectively vary
within wide limits from time to time. Their total amount fluctuates
according to the volume of taxes coming in at different seasons of the
year, the recency with which loans have been contracted for capital
expenditure, the proximity of extraordinary expenditure impending, the
receipts of windfalls of income (as, recently, from the opium revenue),
the general prosperity of the country, and the degree of caution or
optimism which, in the opinion of those responsible for the finances,
the general situation warrants. The proportions held in rupees and
sterling respectively depend even more on considerations of temporary
convenience,—recent or impending capital transactions in London, the
likelihood of sterling funds being wanted for the purchase of silver,
and trade demands for Council Bills as a means of remittance. The
totals of the cash balances at various dates are given below.

  (a) Excluding balances held in the Gold Standard Reserve.

It may be added that the Indian cash balances are kept partly in
District Treasuries all over the country, partly in Reserve Treasuries,
and partly on deposit at the Presidency Banks. The District Treasuries
do not usually contain more resources than they require for ordinary
transactions, and the balances in excess of immediate requirements,
which are transferred to the Reserve Treasuries, are mainly held in the
form of notes. Thus the Government has no large surplus stock of rupees
outside the Currency Reserve. The London Balances are held partly at
the Bank of England and partly on loan for short periods with certain
financial houses on an approved list.[62] No more than a working
balance (about £500,000) is ordinarily held at the Bank of England, and
this has been reckoned for many years now (though not formerly) amongst
the “other” deposits, not amongst the “public” deposits. It will be
seen from the table given above that the London Balances fell to a low
level in 1908, the Secretary of State making free use of them to aid
him in supporting exchange during the critical months of that year. On
October 30, 1908, these balances had sunk to £1,196,691. In 1911 and
1912, on the other hand, they reached a very high figure, and in June
of both these years exceeded £19,000,000. By the end of 1912 they had
sunk again to a more normal level. This abnormally high level in the
first half of 1912 gave rise to much criticism in regard both to the
amount of the balances and also to the method adopted of lending them
out in the London Money Market. Something will be said about this in
the concluding paragraphs of this chapter.

5. We are now in a position to see exactly what resources in sterling
and rupees respectively the Indian authorities have, on which to draw
for the fulfilment of their currency obligations. Since the surplus
balances in India, beyond those required by the District Treasuries and
those deposited with the Presidency Banks, are mainly held in notes, we
may neglect them for the present purpose.

_Rupee Reserves_ are held partly in the Currency Reserve, partly in the
Gold Standard Reserve. In December 1912 the amounts were approximately
as follows:—

  Currency Reserve(a)       £10,000,000
  Gold Standard Reserve       3,750,000
                            ─────—————–
                            £13,750,000

(a) Including silver bullion in India or in transit.

_Sterling Reserves_ are held partly in the Currency Reserve, partly in
the Gold Standard Reserve, and partly in the London Cash Balances. The
forms in which they are held are gold (in the Currency Reserve, both in
India and London, and to a small extent in the Gold Standard Reserve),
money lent at short notice (in the Gold Standard Reserve and in the
Cash Balances), and sterling securities (in the Currency Reserve
and in the Gold Standard Reserve). In December 1912 the amounts were
approximately as follows:—

6. Before we consider the adequacy of these reserves for their
purposes, it will be useful to recall the circumstances of the two
recent occasions on which their resources were severely taxed. The
Government were hard pressed to supply sufficient rupees in 1906, and
hard pressed to supply sufficient sterling in 1908. We can deal with
both these occasions in a continuous narrative.

The coinage of rupees recommenced on a significant scale in 1900. For
the five years following there was a steady annual demand for fresh
coinage (low in 1901–2, high in 1903–4, but at no time abnormal) and
the Mints were able to meet it with time to spare, though there was
some slight difficulty in 1903–4. In 1905–6 the demand quickened, and
from July 1905, when the Government’s silver reserves stood at what was
then considered the comfortable figure of 1837 lakhs[63] (£12,250,000),
it quite outstript the new supplies arising from the mintage of the
uncoined silver reserve. The Government were very slow to buy more
silver and, in fact, do not seem to have taken steps to do so until,
in December 1905, their bullion reserve was quite exhausted. They had
then to buy silver in London hurriedly and at rather a high price.
In the meantime the rupee reserves had sunk to the very low figure
of 761 lakhs (_i.e._, about 40% of the holdings six months earlier),
and the demand for Council Bills in London, which would have to be
cashed in rupees in India, showed no signs of abating. In order to give
themselves breathing space, and to allow time for the silver recently
bought in London to reach India and be coined, the Government had to
raise the price of telegraphic transfers to what was then the unusually
high figure of ¼–5/32. This was the worst that happened. The new
coinage very quickly overtook and passed the demand, and by the end of
March 1906 the available silver reserves were double what they had been
in January.

This slight scare, however, was more than sufficient to make the
Government lose their heads. Having once started on a career of furious
coinage, they continued to do so with little regard to considerations
of ordinary prudence—though their sins did not overtake them
immediately. Without waiting to see how the busy season of 1906–7
would turn out, they coined heavily throughout the summer months, and,
there being more silver in hand than could be conveniently held in the
Currency Reserve, it was maintained, at the expense of the sterling
resources, in the Gold Standard Reserve. In July 1906 the silver
reserve stood at about 3200 lakhs. As a matter of fact the season of
1906–7 turned out well, and the demand for rupees was on a large scale.
Yet the available silver in India hardly fell below 2000 lakhs—nearly
three times the minimum at the most critical moment of the preceding
year. The more than adequacy of their reserve at the busiest moment
of the very busy season 1906–7 did not check, however, the impetuous
activity of the Mints. During the summer of 1907, as in the summer of
1906, they continued to coin without waiting until the prosperity of
the season 1907–8 was assured. In September 1907 their silver holdings
in one form or another stood at the excessive figure of 3148 lakhs.
This time they got what they deserved. The season of 1907–8 was a
failure, and at the end of 1907 came the crisis in America. In place
of there being a demand for new rupees, it was necessary to withdraw
from circulation an immense volume of the old ones; and the sterling
reserves, not the rupee reserves, were in danger of insufficiency. This
leads us to the next chapter of the history.

7. The coinage policy of the Government of India from 1905 to 1907
suggests one obvious reflection. A succession of years, in which there
is a heavy demand for currency, makes it less likely that the heavy
demand will persist in the year following. The effects of heavy coinage
are cumulative. The Indian authorities do not seem to have understood
this. They were, to all appearances, influenced by the crude inductive
argument that, because there was a heavy demand in 1905–6, it was
likely that there would be an equally heavy demand in 1906–7; and, when
there actually was a heavy demand in 1906–7, that this made it yet more
likely that there would be a heavy demand in 1907–8. They framed their
policy, that is to say, as though a community consumed currency with
the same steady appetite with which some communities consume beer. In
so far as the new currency is to satisfy the demands, not of hoarding,
but of trade, it is hardly necessary to point out the fallacy.
Moreover, even a superficial acquaintance with the currency history of
India brings experience to the support of reason. Even when the rupee
was worth no more than its bullion value, so that it was hoarded and
melted much more than it is now, years of unusually heavy coinage were
nearly always followed by a reaction. India has taken her coinage in
great gulps, and it need not have been difficult to see that the demand
of 1905–7 was one of these.

8. The Government of India’s silver policy during the early part of
1907 left them, therefore, in a somewhat worse position to meet the
crisis which came at the end of the year, than need have been the case.
But their sterling reserves were nevertheless fairly high. On September
1, 1907, they seem to have been, approximately, as follows:—

Thus, to take a round figure, the crisis found the Secretary of State
with about £31,000,000 in hand. The storm was soon on him. By the
end of October 1907 it had become plain that the Indian harvest would
be a bad one, and the financial crisis in the United States was fast
developing. On November 4 the Bank of England raised its rate to 6 per
cent, and on November 7 (for the first time since 1873) to 7 per cent.
On November 6 the Secretary of State could only manage to sell even 30
lakhs of rupees by allowing the rate to drop to the minimum figure of
1s. 3–29/32d. For several weeks following, at a time of year when the
demand for Council Bills is usually strong, he sold none at all. But
beyond withdrawing from the market he took no further steps for the
support of exchange. This measure was inadequate to effect its purpose,
and there is a good deal to be said for the view that he ought to have
taken at once the more drastic steps for maintaining the gold value of
the rupee which he had to take a few months later. However, it was a
perplexing and unprecedented time for every one, and that it was some
weeks before his advisers found their bearings is not to be wondered at.

So inadequate was his action that at first the fall in exchange was
scarcely stayed at all. Tumbling day by day, it reached on November
25 the rate of ⅓–11/16. This is below the gold export point (from
India), and it could not have fallen so low if the Government had made
gold freely available in India. But, as can be seen from the preceding
table, their Indian gold reserve was not large. Individuals were not
permitted, therefore, to take out more than £10,000 at a time; and
in this manner the gold dribbled slowly away over a period of a few
months. It would probably have been of more use if it had been allowed
to disappear in a week at the moment when it was most badly wanted.

In the meantime the Secretary of State, deprived of his usual source of
income from the sale of Council Bills, was meeting his normal expenses
from the gold portion of the Currency Reserve in London. But the Gold
Standard Reserve, although about £1,000,000 worth of Consols was sold
out in order to be ready for use in a more liquid form, was kept so far
intact.

Thus matters went on until the end of December 1907, when the
authorities nerved themselves, although the immediate necessity had
temporarily disappeared through a slight strengthening of exchange, to
take whatever drastic steps might be necessary to maintain the gold
value of the rupee. It was announced that they would sell in India
telegraphic transfers on London at a fixed rate. Before the need arose
for acting on this announcement, it was changed into an offer to sell
sterling bills on London at the fixed minimum rate of ⅓–29/32.

By March 1908 the reserves of actual gold were nearly exhausted, but
the securities and cash at short notice had not yet been trenched
on. Early in April exchange was again weak, and the offer referred
to above came into active operation. At first £500,000 a week, and
later £1,000,000 a week of sterling bills on London were sold in
India at ⅓–29/32. These were cashed in London from the proceeds of
selling securities from the Gold Standard Reserve. By August 1908 about
£8,000,000 of bills had been cashed in this way. At the beginning of
September 1908 the sterling reserves, which I give for comparison with
the amounts in September 1907 quoted above, were, approximately, as
follows:—

  _Gold_—
      Currency Reserve in India                 £150,000
      Currency Reserve in London               1,850,000

                                             ═══════════

9. Thus the Secretary of State’s sterling resources sank in the
course of a year from about £31,000,000 to about £11,000,000. But
these figures do not supply by themselves a complete explanation of
the manner in which he had financed himself in London during this
period. Between September 1907 and September 1908 railway loans to
the aggregate amount of about £12,500,000 and a loan of £2,000,000
for “general purposes”[64] were raised in sterling.[65] A large part
of the former was required for the discharge of some previously
existing railway debentures, and for the purchase in England of railway
materials chargeable to capital account. In so far as the loan was
used for these purposes it did not help the general position. But in
so far as it was used for railway construction which could be paid
for by rupees in India, it had the effect of increasing the Secretary
of State’s sterling resources by a corresponding amount. Altogether,
during the period under review, the net assistance obtained by loans
amounted, I think, to about £4,500,000; so that the total deterioration
in the Secretary of State’s position during the first year of the
depression was not far short of £25,000,000.

After October 1908 the market still showed some hesitation. If the
season had turned out poorly, it is clear that the Secretary of State
must have had recourse to borrowing on a fairly heavy scale. In fact
the harvest was satisfactory, and by December 1908 the demand for
Council Bills was strong. It may be added to complete the story, that
in August and September 1909 there was a short period of weakness when
it was again necessary to offer sterling bills in Calcutta. Since that
time India has enjoyed a period of very great prosperity, and, so far
from the reserves being tested, it has been possible to build up the
very strong position analysed above.

10. I have looked at the crisis so far from the point of view of its
effect in depleting the sterling resources of the Secretary of State.
To the authorities in India it presented its other face. There it was
a question of how many rupees they would be able to withdraw from
circulation. Unless there is a deficiency in the revenue from taxation,
and apart from loans, the extent to which the Secretary of State can
draw on sterling resources must exactly equal the extent to which the
Government of India can withdraw rupees from circulation. For every
transfer from the sterling branch of any of the reserves must be
balanced by a corresponding transfer into the rupee branch. The amount
of the sterling reserves is a measure of the ability of the authorities
to withdraw rupees; and conversely, the volume of rupees which can be
spared from the circulation (or from hoards) in bad times sets an upper
limit to the extent to which they can be compelled to draw on their
sterling reserves for the support of the currency.

Regarded from this standpoint, the facts were as follows:—By March
1908 nearly 115 million rupees had been withdrawn into the currency
reserve by the release of gold, and by December 1908 the figure had
risen to 154 million. Up to March 1908 it had not been necessary to
take rupees into the Gold Standard Reserve; but by the end of November
1908 about 130 million rupees had been withdrawn in this way. There
was also a small increase of rupees in that part of the Indian Cash
Balances which is held in rupees and not in currency notes. Thus the
active circulation was reduced altogether by about 285 million rupees
(£19,000,000). This figure agrees closely enough with the figures we
reached by studying the state of the sterling resources.

11. This completes the narrative of events up to the end of the crisis
of 1908. I have given only such details as are relevant to my main
topic—the adequacy of the reserves to fulfil their purpose.

12. Let us consider, first, the adequacy of the reserve of coined
rupees. The governing facts of the situation are that every addition
to the rupee reserve diminishes to an equivalent extent the amount
available for the sterling reserve; that if the rupee reserve
is insufficient, nothing worse can happen than some delay and
inconvenience to merchants at a time of boom, whereas, if the sterling
reserve is insufficient, a dangerous crisis may be aggravated to the
pitch of panic; that at the last moment the rupee reserve can always
be replenished with no very great delay from the resources of the
sterling reserve, whereas the reverse is not the case (the silver
being not so saleable at a crisis as the gold is in a boom); and that,
therefore, it is desirable to keep the rupee reserve at the lowest
possible point consistent with probability and ordinary prudence. The
practical information chiefly required for settling the proper policy
is in regard to the ease with which new rupees can be supplied as they
are wanted—as to how far, that is to say, the Government can safely
pursue the policy of living from hand to mouth. This depends upon how
fast silver can be bought by the Government without its submitting to
extravagant charges, and how fast, in relation to the maximum rates of
new demand so far experienced, the Indian Mints can turn the silver
into rupees.

13. The Government of India’s recent attempt to solve the first part of
the problem unhappily involved its officers in a good deal of obloquy.
The silver market is a very narrow one and can only be dealt in through
the agency of one or other of a very small number of brokers. A ring of
speculators lay waiting to force prices up as soon as the Government
should appear as a buyer. Apart from the brokers who acted for the
ring, there was only one firm in a position to buy large quantities of
silver with the secrecy which was necessary if the speculators were to
be defeated. Unfortunately the head of this firm was closely related
by blood to the Parliamentary Under–Secretary of State. Two courses
were open: to buy openly and pay such extra price as the speculators
might find themselves in a position to demand, or to risk charges
of venality from any one who might have an interest in discrediting
the Government—disappointed speculators, currency malcontents, or
members of the political party in opposition. The officials, thinking
(bureaucratically) more of the Indian Exchequer and the Indian taxpayer
than of the House of Commons, chose, in fact, the second of the two
alternatives—in a spirit, perhaps, of too great innocence, bred of
long immunity from charges of personal corruption. It turned out that
they had made insufficient allowance for the deep interest which the
House of Commons takes in suggestions of personal scandal. The question
of Indian currency became almost interesting. Members asked one another
what the Gold Standard Reserve might be, and, when writers in the Press
told them, were duly horrified to learn that it contained no gold.
Closer inquiry elicited further facts unsuspected hitherto. It was
discovered that a number of the most prominent members of the London
Money Market were Jews, and that the Government of India’s holdings of
Consols had depreciated in market value since they were bought. But
attention was specially concentrated on the fact that the cash balances
held in London, after fluctuating considerably from time to time, had
risen for a year past to an unusually high level, and had been lent
out at low rates of interest to persons many of whom bore foreign
names. How was the ordinary member of Parliament to be sure that some
cosmopolitan syndicate of Jews was not fattening at the expense of
the ryots of India, whose trustee he had often declared himself to
be? Indian currency is too complicated a subject to be mastered at a
moment’s notice; and many persons, without paying much attention to
random charges of corruption, felt, quite legitimately, that there was
a great deal going on of which they had no conception, and that they
would like to be fully satisfied for themselves, and not merely on
the word of the officials, that everything was really in order. The
situation in its fundamentals has arisen before, and will arise from
time to time in the future so long as the relations of the House of
Commons to India combine in a high degree responsibility and ignorance.

14. The circumstances themselves are of very transient importance,
but they are likely to have some permanent effect on the particular
question which we are now discussing. It will be too much to expect the
officials to expose their personal reputations again to a suspicion,
however ill–founded, even in the interests of the Indian Exchequer.
Next time that the Government of India have to buy silver on a large
scale, it is likely that they will do so publicly and pay such extra
price as this policy involves. It is not worth a Government’s while to
risk its transactions falling into suspicion in order to save half a
million pounds. Assuming, therefore, that in future the Government will
have to buy publicly, we have to consider whether it is likely to be
cheaper for them to buy when the price of silver seems low, and hold
stocks in hand, or to wait until the last moment and buy at whatever
price is then ruling. I am inclined to think that the second of these
two policies is the better—though it is plainly a matter on which it
is not possible at present to see one’s way clearly. It is outside the
ordinary run of Government officials’ duties to judge whether or not
a given time is a good one at which to buy silver. The speculative
business of estimating the future of silver is best left to experts
in the matter, even though the price ultimately paid has to include
some commission to them for their services or their foresight. In the
second place the history of the recent speculative ring in silver,
so far as it can be known to an outsider, does not suggest that such
a transaction is a very easy or profitable thing to carry through,
or that the speculators have had a sufficiently striking success to
encourage similar attempts on a large scale in the future. I do not
know with what profit the ring have emerged from the transaction; but
the expense of carrying silver for a long period is great, and the rise
in its price in the last two years, though substantial, has not been
enough—so far as one can judge—to leave a surplus of profits at all
commensurate with the great risks run. In the third place, it does not
seem certain that the urgent demands for fresh coinage of rupees, to
which India is subject from time to time, will be as frequent in the
future as they have been in the immediate past. On the one hand the
heavy coinages since 1900 are cumulative in their effect and render
further coinages in the future less probable; and on the other hand an
increased use (it is to be hoped) of other media of exchange will allow
an urgent demand for currency to be met in other ways.

15. I do not think, therefore, that the Government need show a very
long foresight lest they should have to buy silver dear. But when their
stocks are falling low and there are apparently signs of demand in the
_immediate_ future, how long can coinage be delayed safely? To answer
this we need to know the maximum rate of output of the Mints, and the
maximum rate of absorption of new currency so far experienced.

16. The rates of absorption of rupees in various years have been
given in the Table on p. 55. The maximum absorption in the October
to December quarter was 11·39 lakhs in 1905–6, and the maximum in
the January to March quarter was 2·68 lakhs in 1909–10. It has been
estimated that the Indian Mints can turn out 2·25 lakhs of rupees per
month without overtime, and 4·50 lakhs per month with overtime. There
seems little reason, therefore, for over–anxiety lest the Government
be caught short of rupees. If they were to start the busy season with
a surplus of 500 or 600 lakhs over what was considered a safe minimum,
the reasonable demands of prudence would have been fully satisfied.
The safe minimum in question must necessarily depend on circumstances,
especially on the volume of the note issue and on the amount of gold
held in India; it is impossible to suggest any figure which would
be permanently suitable. I am dealing merely with the surplus over
this minimum which, on the basis of experience, the Government might
reasonably take pains to have in stock at the beginning of a busy
season. The calculation refers throughout to their _aggregate_ rupee
resources in the Currency Reserve and Gold Standard Reserve combined.

17. We now come to the much more important question of the adequacy of
the sterling reserves.

I do not think it has ever been thought out quite clearly for what
precise purposes these reserves are held. The difficulty can be put
shortly in this question,—Are they held purely as a currency reserve,
or are they to fulfil also the purpose of a banking reserve? Is their
only purpose, that is to say, to make certain that the Government
will always be able to exchange for sterling such rupees and notes as
may be presented to them, or are they also intended to ensure India’s
being able to meet her international obligations at a time of dangerous
crisis? The two purposes are plainly not identical. If all bankers
and merchants keep adequate reserves in rupees and notes, then it
will be sufficient if the Government are always able to turn these
rupees and notes into sterling. But if in a financial crisis the Indian
Money Market as a whole is in fact unable to meet its international
obligations without Government assistance, is it the Government’s
intention to stand calmly aside and permit (for example) a suspension
of cash payments by the three Presidency Banks, or will they, if
necessary, use their sterling reserves to give some support to the
Indian Money Market _in extremis_?

If the Government’s Reserve is held purely to support the currency,
then the maximum volume of rupees and notes, which could, so far as
one can anticipate, be spared from the circulation and tendered to the
Government for exchange, sets an upper limit to the necessary amount
of this Reserve. If, on the other hand, it is intended to act as a
banking reserve and to ensure India’s ability to meet her international
obligations at all times, then its upper limit is set by the probable
maximum amount of the adverse balance which could arise against India
for immediate payment.

18. I will begin by discussing this question on the first
hypothesis—that what the Government has been accumulating is intended
to serve as a currency reserve only—and will return later to the
problem of a reserve held for wider purposes, and of the possible
magnitude of the balance of international indebtedness against India.

19. To estimate the demand that the reserves might have to meet merely
in order to support the currency, the existing volume of currency is
what we chiefly require to know. For this sets, or suggests, a limit
to the maximum amount which can possibly be spared from the active
circulation.

Attempts to estimate the rupee circulation of India have been the
occasion of some very interesting calculations. For many years past
(since 1875) an annual census of rupees has been taken by examining in
each Government Treasury a bag containing 2000. This enabled Mr. F. C.
Harrison, when he was Comptroller of Currency, to apply the Jevonian
method very fully; and he was also able to corroborate his estimates by
reference to the numbers of the older issues, 1835 and 1840 (_e.g._),
actually withdrawn from circulation on the occasions when the Mint
recalled them. Mr. Harrison’s results were checked by the labours of
a later Comptroller of Currency, Mr. Adie, who applied to the same
material two alternative methods of much greater technical complexity
than Mr. Harrison’s.[66]

Jevons’s method is based on the assumptions that the proportions of
coins issued at different dates found in the given samples roughly
correspond to their proportions in the circulation at large, and that
the numbers in circulation of the latest issues do not much differ
from the numbers issued from the Mint. In short, if we know the
relative proportions of coins of 1860 and of 1912 in the circulation,
and if we know, approximately, the absolute number of coins of 1912,
we can calculate the absolute number still circulating of the coins of
1860. In applying this method to the Indian data, we are assuming that
the proportions of rupees of each date found in the bags examined in
a great number of scattered Government Treasuries are a fair sample
of the proportions still in circulation throughout the country. In a
country such as India, however, there may be great stagnancy in a part
of the circulation, and the coins finding their way to the Government
Treasuries may be a sample rather of the floating surplus of coinage,
which has a relatively high velocity of circulation, than of the
total stock, which includes semi–hoards passing from hand to hand
comparatively seldom. Since these samples are likely, therefore, to
contain an undue proportion of recent issues, estimates of the total
circulation, which are based on them, may be expected to fall short
of the truth rather than to exceed it. There is reason, also, for
supposing that in some cases the officials charged with the duty of
examining the samples did not always deal with them conscientiously. A
tendency was noticed for the returns of one year to resemble those of
the previous year more closely than they should, and not infrequently a
batch of coins would be attributed to a year in which it is known that
none were minted. Nevertheless the calculations of Mr. Harrison and Mr.
Adie, and the data on which they are based, seem on the whole coherent,
and bear, so far as one can judge, the marks of substantial accuracy.

A quite different method of estimating the circulation has been
adopted by Mr. F. J. Atkinson.[67] His method is direct; and consists
in a calculation or estimate of the additions to the currency and
the losses from export, melting, etc., year by year, from 1831 when
the modern coinage first began. Some of the items in the calculation
are definitely known, but others, the amount annually melted, for
example, are almost entirely a matter of guesswork. The fact that his
calculations contain altogether a great number of separate guesses
does not prevent his final result from being a guess too. For the
period previous to the closing of the Mints some of his estimates for
the amount melted seem very low, and this may possibly explain why
his final results yield a much higher total for the circulation than
those of Mr. Harrison and Mr. Adie. In recent times, _i.e._ since the
closing of the Mints, and specially since the new equilibrium which
was reached in 1900, Mr. Atkinson’s method is much more satisfactory
than for earlier years and, since the doubtful items are in these later
years a far smaller proportion of the whole, much less likely to lead
us wrong. For the earlier years, therefore, I am inclined to prefer
Mr. Harrison’s conclusions; but I think they can be brought up to date
by a year–to–year method resembling Mr. Atkinson’s. The increase in
Mr. Atkinson’s estimate during the ’nineties is due to the fact that,
as his figures purport to exclude rupees in hoards, he must make large
allowance for the coins from this source then entering into circulation.

The actual figures are as follows:—

(a) Of Mr. Atkinson’s two separate calculations, made in 1897 and 1903,
I have taken the latter. His calculation explicitly excludes rupees
in hoards, currency reserves, and Government balances; and is not,
therefore, entirely comparable with the others. If it were, the excess
would be considerably greater than it actually appears above.

20. These are the _data_. It is very difficult to estimate the extent
to which rupees may have emerged from hoards during the period which
succeeded the closing of the Mints. Mr. Atkinson’s figures suggest
that rupees from this source not only made good the natural wastage in
the active circulation but actually brought about a large increase in
it. Judging from the course of prices, I think he must have made an
excessive allowance under this head. The figures of Mr. Harrison and
Mr. Adie, on the other hand (which refer to the _total_ circulation),
point to a more moderate influx out of hoards into current use. I
propose to take a middle course, nearer, however, to Mr. Harrison than
to Mr. Atkinson, and to assume a _public_ circulation in 1900 (_i.e._,
excluding rupees in the Currency Reserve and Government Balances) of
120 crores of rupees. This estimate is probably near enough to the
truth for our purpose. If it is incorrect, I think it is more likely to
be an underestimate than an overestimate.

Starting from this assumption, I have worked out the details given
in the following table as a guide to the probable circulation at the
present time. By _public_ circulation, whether of rupees or notes, I
mean the whole circulation not in the hands of the Government—_i.e._,
including that in the hands of the banks. I am primarily concerned with
the circulation of rupees; but the public circulation of notes has been
added in the last column but one, as it is useful to know at the same
time the _total_ public circulation of currency.

(a) This column is derived from the figures given by the Currency
Department, and the total of net coinage issued in individual years
differs somewhat from the total amount minted as stated in the Mint
Statistics.

(b) In one or two of the earlier years deduction is made on account of
an appreciable sum in rupees paid out to native states. This deduction
is in accordance with the practice of the reports of the Currency
Department.

(c) For Bahrain Islands, Ceylon, Arabia, Mauritius, and East African
Coast.

(d) Not allowing for natural wastage of rupees (see below).

This calculation makes no allowance for the general wastage through
loss and various causes, or for the steady drain of rupees across the
land frontiers. This last item is probably considerable and is not
adequately accounted for in the trade returns. The recorded statistics
of trade overland show a large annual balance against India, which
is probably met by an unrecorded export of gold, silver bullion, and
rupees. In the case of Nepal, for example, the recorded statistics
show a considerable net balance of imports of treasure _into_ India;
and in the case of Tibet, Afghanistan and, in fact, all the land
frontiers, the official statistics of the export of treasure do not
tally with what we know of the circulation of the rupee beyond the
frontiers. Taking all these causes of loss together, I do not think
we should overestimate the wastage of rupees from the circulation in
placing it between half a crore and a crore annually. For the twelve
years 1900 to 1912, therefore, I propose to make an aggregate deduction
of 941 lakhs.

This leaves us with a public circulation of 175 crores of rupees
(£116,500,000) on March 31, 1912, and a total public circulation,
including notes, of 228 crores[68] (£152,000,000), being an increase
since 1900 of 46 per cent in the rupee circulation and of 58 per cent
in the total circulation. If Mr. Atkinson’s estimate of the circulation
in 1900 is nearer the truth than Mr. Harrison’s, then the public rupee
circulation in 1912 may have been as much as 200 crores. In the course
of 1912 there was a good deal of fresh coinage, of which, at the time
of writing, accurate statistics are not yet available. For our present
purpose it will be quite sufficiently cautious to think of the public
rupee and note circulation together as amounting to not more than 250
crores.

21. How much of this could possibly be spared from circulation at a
time of crisis? In 1908 the rupee circulation fell (at its lowest
point) by somewhat less than 30 crores, or less than 20 per cent of the
estimated rupee circulation at that time. The note circulation (see p.
55) fell much less seriously. It does not seem to me likely that the
Government could be called on at the present time to redeem more than
25 per cent of the total circulation (notes and rupees together), or,
on the basis of the foregoing calculations, 60 crores (say) of rupees
(£40,000,000). If the Government were to keep in one way or another a
reserve of this amount for purely currency purposes, I think they would
have done as much as reasonable prudence could require. I do not say
that it is impossible that they should be called on to redeem a greater
amount than this. But it would be extravagant to maintain a reserve
adequate for all conceivable emergencies, since there is a further
resort of which use might fairly be made without great reluctance.
Unless the London Money Market has collapsed as well as the Indian, it
is always open to the Secretary of State to borrow by means of India
Bills. There would be nothing shameful in this—though possibly some
expense. But the expense, even if the Secretary of State had to pay a
rate of interest appropriate to Turkey or China, would be much less
than the expense of maintaining a very great reserve against unlikely
emergencies.[69]

22. So much for the proper magnitude of the Reserve, regarded as a
Currency Reserve. The question of its use as a Banking Reserve raises
two problems—a problem of policy and a problem of statistics. Ought
the Government to allow its Reserve to be used as a Banking Reserve? If
so, how large ought this Reserve to be? Let us consider policy first.

23. There are three kinds of crises by which the Indian Money Market
might be assailed—a purely internal crisis, in which the banks have
difficulty in meeting a run on them by their Indian depositors; a
purely external crisis, in which India owes, and is called on to pay,
large sums in the London Market, but is free from serious banking
trouble at home; and a general crisis, in which the features of an
internal and an external crisis are combined.

A purely internal crisis of the first kind might require assistance
from the resources of Government, but would involve no claims on their
sterling resources specifically, as distinguished from their rupee
resources. The trouble would probably begin with a boom of the usual
type, heavy commitments on the part of the banks, large importations
of foreign goods, and (in the future) a good deal of internal company
promoting. If, early in the autumn, a serious failure of the monsoon
became apparent, a widespread suspension on the part of the numerous
bubble banks, which have been springing up lately all over India,[70]
would be a probable consequence. Indian depositors generally might take
alarm and hoard money in their own houses on a large scale. Exchange
Banks have such large deposits in India and so little cash there[71]
that they would probably require to import funds from London as fast as
possible. The Indian Joint Stock Banks, however, are now so important
that the part played by the Exchange Banks might not be adequate to
save the situation. The Government would then be called on to make
advances to the Presidency Banks. This has happened from time to time
in the past, the last occasion being in April 1898, when the Bank of
Bombay, whose bank rate was then at 13 per cent, asked the Government
for an advance of 25 lakhs.[72]

This raises the first question of policy—whether the Government should
help the bankers’ reserves on an occasion of internal crisis by making
rupee advances to them. But it is hardly relevant to the question of
the Government’s _sterling_ resources; and, unless the Government
Savings Banks were to be in trouble at the same time, it is not likely
that there would be any difficulty in helping the bankers, if it were
thought right to do so.

A crisis of the second kind, due to general depression or bad harvests,
in which India has to meet a heavy adverse balance in London,
provided that, as in 1907, it is not accompanied by internal banking
difficulties of the kind just described, causes, it is true, a drain on
the Government’s sterling resources through the necessity of providing
remittance on London, but only in proportion to the volume of notes and
rupees which are brought to the Government for encashment or in payment
of sterling drafts.

At first, therefore, in such a case, there is no question of the
Government’s using its reserves otherwise than as currency reserves;
and the banks will have plenty of notes and rupees with which to buy
the Government’s sterling drafts. Only if the depression is very
prolonged, and one bad harvest follows another, is the need likely to
arise for sterling advances from Government, otherwise than against a
corresponding face value of notes and rupees.

It is not very improbable, however, that in the future there might be
a general crisis of the third kind—a heavy adverse balance against
India, and an internal banking crisis at the same time. It is in these
circumstances that the most difficult question of policy arises. The
Indian Money Market would need to remit funds to London, but, on
account of the internal banking crisis and an outbreak of hoarding
amongst depositors, would not have even rupee resources with which to
do it. Consequently the Government’s offer to sell sterling drafts in
Calcutta, or to release gold from the Currency Reserve would not meet
the case. If general distrust of banking was widely spread, and notes,
gold, and rupees were being hoarded in the old–fashioned way on a large
scale, the banks would not be able to put their hands on sufficient
cash resources of any kind to enable them to pay for the Government’s
drafts on a scale adequate to their necessities. The position would be
that the Indian Money Market was on the verge of general insolvency
with the Presidency Bank Rates at (say) 12 per cent, and that the
Indian Government had (say) £40,000,000 sterling resources in hand with
demands on only a modest scale for the encashment of notes and rupees.
The Government would be vehemently urged to save the situation by
making sterling advances, not simply in exchange for notes or rupees,
but on some other non–monetary security.

24. We now have the possibilities before us. If in any of these sets
of circumstances the Government were faced with demands for advances
either in rupees or sterling, what line would it be proper to take?

On the one hand the policy of advances may introduce into the Indian
Money Market a serious element of weakness,—an element, perhaps,
inseparable from a system where there is no central banking authority
and where the currency authority stands, normally, outside the money
market. It is not the business of the Government to hold any of the
reserves which the bankers ought to hold. But if the Government does,
in fact, for another purpose hold large reserves in its hands, and if
it is believed that it will in case of extreme necessity come to the
market’s rescue, the bankers may tend to keep somewhat lower reserves
than they ought, and than they otherwise would. We have over again
the situation which has long existed, to its detriment, in the United
States. There, as in India, the Government, with immense currency
reserves of gold, is normally aloof from the money market. There
also they have no central banking authority. The expectation that
the Government will bring some of its gold to the rescue in extreme
circumstances, has always been said to exert an enervating influence
on the banks themselves in the matter of the precautions they take
for times of crisis. The ultimate solution probably lies in the
establishment of a Central Bank for India which shall be the Government
Bank and shall hold the banking and currency reserves at the same
time.[73]

In the meantime, in spite of this consideration, the Government will
not, I think, be able to resist the pressure on them in a crisis to
come to the assistance of the market. Indeed, I do not know that they
ought to resist it. It would be absurd to have large reserves in hand,
and not to use them to avert a general calamity. The awkwardness of the
situation is intrinsic, and cannot be avoided so long as the present
divorce is maintained between the banking and the currency authorities.
The plans of the Government ought, therefore, to be laid accordingly.

25. If there is force in this contention, and unless the Government
of India have definitely made up their minds that their sterling
reserves are to be used in no circumstances except for the support of
exchange and of the sterling value of their currency, it is important
to understand that immediate action is essential, and that to delay
action for a few weeks may be fatal. I would emphatically apply to
India the well–known doctrine which the powerful advocacy of Mr.
Bagehot raised in England, many years ago, to an impregnable position
in the unwritten constitution of this country—the doctrine, namely,
that in a time of panic the reserves of the Bank of England must, at
a suitably high rate, be placed at the disposal of the public without
stint and without delay. There is a danger that the matter may not
be thought out until, quite suddenly, the financial crisis comes,
and that then, while the decision is being taken and the best advice
sought, an inadvertent delay will intervene. If there were signs of a
general banking crisis in India, and particularly if the position of
the Exchange Banks were weakening in England, I am inclined to think
that it would be a wise policy on the part of Government to make an
immediate announcement that they would place up to (say) £10,000,000 at
the disposal of the Presidency Banks (or other approved borrowers) at a
rate of (say) 10 per cent. If this action stayed, as it well might, the
run on the banks in India, and the difficulties of the Exchange Banks
in raising temporary loans in London, the Government might with a very
moderate loss of funds (the mere announcement that they were available
being sufficient) find itself in a far more favourable position for
dealing with the subsequent depression; whereas after a delay a similar
announcement might eventually be forced upon them, and if the panic had
then gained impetus, the £10,000,000 quickly lapt up.

26. Two points connected with the above may be emphasised before we
pass on to the statistical problem. In the first place, in the event of
a _financial_ crisis, accompanied by numerous bank failures, I do not
think it likely that the Government would be overwhelmed with demands
for the encashment in sterling of notes and rupees. It would be much
more in accordance with what we know of similar crises elsewhere to
expect hoarding on a large scale, rather than a diminished demand for
currency and an ability to export it. In this matter the experience
of 1907–8, when the monetary position in India was easy throughout,
may prove, I think, misleading. During the eventful weeks in November
1907, when the Bank of England rate stood at 7 per cent, the Bank of
Bengal rate did not rise above 6 per cent.[74] No tendency whatever was
apparent for there to be withdrawals of money from the banks in India,
or for hoarding to reassert itself amongst the class which is learning
to bank. On the other hand, the comparative failure of the crops
left financiers with considerable rupee funds in their hands which
they could not use. The banks had, therefore, no special difficulty
in putting their hands on rupees and notes, and the only problem was
for the Government to turn these into sterling. The easiness of the
internal money market at that time and the total absence of banking
trouble have produced the impression that there will be plenty of
rupee funds available at a crisis, and that the only question will be
as to whether the Government can turn these into sterling. The great
development of Indian Joint Stock Banking since that time on not
perfectly sound lines makes it doubtful whether bank troubles will be
absent in an equal degree on the next occasion of difficulty.

There is no one now living in England within whose memory hoarding has
been a normal thing. But in countries where the tradition is but lately
dead or still lingers, it is apt to revive with astonishing vitality
at the least sign of danger. The extent to which the people resorted
to hoarding in France, Germany, and Austria (especially in the latter
country) during the Balkan War was very remarkable, and has exhibited
a danger to which the banking systems of those countries are still
subject, although some had begun to forget it. If this is the case in
European countries, there cannot be much doubt as to what would happen
in India. Some banking failures, a hint of political trouble,—and the
old habits will come back, whatever progress banking may seem to have
made in a time of prosperity.

But, secondly, assuming a sharp financial crisis to be accompanied by
increased hoarding, it would plainly be better if it were a hoarding
of rupees and notes rather than of gold. It is not impossible that
this might be the case. A trust in the Government’s capacity to meet
its obligations will persist some time after all confidence in private
institutions has been dissolved. In Austria, for example, the hoarding
was not so much of gold or silver as of notes. I believe that in some
parts of India, especially in those where gold has made relatively
little progress, hoards are sometimes held already to a fair extent in
notes. I know, for example, a very conservative Brahmin family, small
landowners in Eastern Bengal, where this is the case. Once a week the
head of the family will retire privately to a corner of the roof of the
house, take out the little hoard of notes with ritual care, count and
check them, dust each with a feather brush, and lay them out in the sun
to air and to recover from any trace of damp. If a note shows signs of
age or wear, it is taken to the nearest currency office and changed
for a new one. In troubled times such a family would hoard more notes
or silver, not gold. This, however, is no more than an illustration of
the point I have already dwelt on and emphasised—the manner in which
any increase in the popularity of gold diminishes the stability of the
currency.

27. Returning from these digressions, I conclude that the Government
will not be able in practice to restrict its responsibility to the
currency, and may have to take a part in moderating the consequences
of rash or unfortunate banking, and in meeting an adverse balance of
indebtedness. This conclusion brings us to the statistical problem.
Is the £40,000,000, which I put forward as a safe maximum for the
reserves, so far as the convertibility of the currency is concerned,
still adequate when the possible magnitude of India’s adverse balance
of indebtedness is our test of sufficiency?

This problem is even less capable than the former of exact solution.
The _variable_ elements in India’s international balance–sheet are
chiefly (i.) the excess of exports over imports, including treasure,
_i.e._ the trade balance; (ii.) the amount of _new_ fixed capital lent
to India by European capitalists; and (iii.) the amount of short–period
loans afforded to India by the European Money Market.

We require to know the magnitude of possible _variation_ in these
items, rather than the absolute amount of the various annual payments
which India has to make, in order to gauge the possible balance of
indebtedness against her. The greatest stress is commonly placed on
the first of them—the trade balance. But in the normal state of
affairs receipts and payments only balance after account has been
taken of capital transactions; and if a certain amount of new capital
has been flowing in every year, a slackening of this flow affects the
balance as adversely as a reduction in the volume of exports affects
it. In 1907–8 the adverse balance of indebtedness was largely due to
a change in the trade balance;—on the one hand, goods ordered during
the boom continued to pour into Bombay for some weeks after they had
become unsaleable, thus continuing for a time a large supply of bills
on India, while, on the other hand, the failure of the monsoon and
consequent anticipations of a scanty harvest cut off a considerable
part of the normal supply of trade bills on London. But even on this
occasion the adverse balance arose to a considerable extent out of
changes in capital transactions under items (ii.) and (iii.). The
acute stringency in the international money markets, occasioned by the
position in America, made it necessary for Exchange Banks and others to
reduce below their normal level their short–period borrowings (direct
or indirect) in London for use in India; and this stringency also
caused the flow of new investment to India to fall short of its usual
volume.

Thus, of the adverse balance of some £25,000,000 which had to be met
between September 1907 and September 1908, perhaps £18,000,000 was due
to a change in the trade balance and £7,000,000 to a diminution of
new capital transactions and to the non–renewal of some short–period
loans.[75] It is not easy, however, to argue from the experience of
1907–8 as to what will happen in the future. The volume of trade has
expanded very greatly since that time,[76] and the absolute variation
in the favourable balance between good years and bad is likely to
be correspondingly greater. In addition, the growth of banking in
the intervening period has been on a very great scale; and there is,
therefore, greater room for disturbance in the short–period loan
market. If, moreover, the internal banking position in India is as weak
as in Chapter VII. I make it out to be, a serious breakdown there may
embarrass the Exchange Banks in London, however intrinsically sound the
position of these Banks may really be, in their efforts to assist the
Indian market.

28. These are the relevant considerations. But any conclusion as to
the possible magnitude of the adverse balance at which one can arrive
on the basis of them is little better than a guess. I will give my
guess for what it is worth. I think the £40,000,000, which I have
fixed as the maximum figure of what is required for the redemption
in sterling of such notes and rupees as may be presented, is more
than sufficient to meet the adverse balance that is at all likely to
emerge in any single year. But I do not think it certain that this
sum would be adequate to the necessities of two successive bad years.
On the other hand, it is necessary to bear in mind that by the second
bad year there would have been time for a very great reduction in the
volume of imports, on account of the greatly reduced purchasing power
of the people, and that this might go a long way towards righting
the balance; also that, if there was a considerable liquidation of
short–period loans in the first year, it would not be necessary to
repeat this to anything like the same extent in the second year. In
short, the _natural_ forces tending towards equilibrium would begin in
the second year to show themselves more strongly. Nor is it necessary
to accumulate reserves in advance for every eventuality. Two bad years
in succession are not very likely; and, if they do come, the Secretary
of State will have ample time to make his arrangements for borrowing.

I think it a sufficient concession, therefore, if the £40,000,000 be
given as the proper limit, not as before of the aggregate sterling
resources of all kinds, but of the Gold Standard Reserve and the
sterling branch of the Paper Currency Reserve (_i.e._ excluding the
Cash Balances).

In a country such as India, where all available resources are required
for capital expansion, and where it is not sound or humane policy to
burden the present overmuch for the sake of the future, it is nearly
as important to avoid extravagance in the reserve policy as to avoid
undue parsimony. As the rupee and note circulation is increased, the
proportion of reserves ought to grow, of course, _pari passu_. But in
existing circumstances to hold much more than £40,000,000 in sterling
in the Gold Standard Reserve and the Paper Currency Reserve together
would border on extravagance. If the reserves were somewhat lower than
this, I do not think it would necessarily be blameworthy to leave them
so, provided it would prove a very burdensome thing to raise them. For
the expedient of a loan is always available.[77] My conclusion, rather,
is that the reserves should be allowed to reach some such figure as
this by the natural processes of growth, before sums are diverted from
them to other purposes.

A very few years ago hopes of reaching so secure a position as this
would have seemed chimerical. But the details given on p. 131 show that
in December 1912 the sterling reserves already amounted to somewhat
more than this. It is not yet clear, however, that their present amount
is normal. If it turns out to be so, then a position of adequate
strength has been attained already. But the form in which these
reserves are held is open to much criticism, and this must be my next
topic.

29. The criticisms which have had most popular vogue have been mainly
directed against the absolute amount of the Gold Standard Reserve,
against the investment of a large part of this reserve in securities,
and against the maintenance in London of some part of the gold in the
Currency Reserve.

In regard to the amount of the Gold Standard Reserve, Lord Curzon, in
1904, was inclined to think that £10,000,000 would be a proper figure.
In 1905 Sir E. Law, the Financial Member of the Viceroy’s Council,
suggested £20,000,000. In 1906 Sir E. Baker thought £20,000,000 a
suitable minimum. More recently, in 1912, £25,000,000 is the amount
which responsible officials have announced that they are aiming at.
Sir E. Law and Sir E. Baker both based their estimates on the amount
which the Secretary of State would require for his Home Charges if he
had to curtail his drawings of Council Bills by one–third or one–half
for a considerable period. I do not think that this is the most useful
point of view from which to approach the question, or that the proper
magnitude of the Gold Standard Reserve can be discussed without
reference to the magnitude of the other reserves.

30. The other two criticisms quoted above lead on to the general
question of how the sterling resources should be held and how they
should be divided between the several Reserves. The second of these
questions is mainly a matter of book–keeping, but has nevertheless
some importance. The Government of India’s present system has no
logical basis, is exceedingly difficult to understand, and has often
led, in consequence, to a good deal of misunderstanding. The ideal
system should be as simple and logical as is compatible with leaving
the authorities a free hand to shift and adjust as the necessities
of the moment may require. The present system is the outcome partly
of historical origins, partly of the authorities not having allowed
themselves by law a perfectly free hand. The much criticised practice,
for example, of holding six crores of coined rupees in the Gold
Standard Reserve is probably due to the provision by which that
portion of the Currency Reserve, which is held in London, can be
held only in gold. If rupees have to be released hurriedly from the
silver portion of the Gold Standard Reserve in India, the authorities
have a completely free hand as to the form in which they make the
corresponding addition to their sterling reserves in London; whereas,
if they are released from the Currency Reserve, the corresponding
transference in London must be made wholly in gold coin—a course which
may sometimes be exceedingly inconvenient at the moment.

31. If the authorities allowed themselves more latitude as to the
manner in which the Currency Reserve might be held, it would be a mere
book–keeping transaction to transfer to this reserve the rupees now
held in silver in the Gold Standard Reserve and to replace them by a
corresponding transfer of gold; but such an arrangement would be more
logical and easier to understand.

32. I think, therefore, that there might be considerable advantages
in the adoption of some general scheme for the reserves such as the
following:—

(1) While it would be legal to hold the Gold Standard Reserve in
_any_ form—gold, securities, bills of exchange, loans, or rupees—it
should be normal in good times to hold, say, £11,000,000 in sterling
securities and the rest in gold either in London or India, but
preferably in London.

(2) Power should be taken to invest a larger amount of the Currency
Reserve than at present (say £7,500,000 sterling securities in addition
to the rupee securities instead of £2,500,000 as at present), and to
hold a prescribed maximum proportion (say one–third) of it in bills of
exchange or on loan at short notice either in India or London.

All this, after the necessary change of law, could be effected by a
change in book–keeping; and in December 1912 the account would have
stood as follows (compare the actual state of affairs as given on p.
131):—

  _Gold_—

                                        ═══════════

33. Some changes of substance might be added to these changes in
book–keeping and are naturally suggested by them. There is, first, the
question whether the gold portion of the reserves ought to be held in
India or in London. Readers of Chapter IV. will know that there are,
in my opinion, no advantages in keeping gold in India, and that such
a policy involves a direct money loss through the cost of originally
carrying the gold to India and the cost of bringing it back again to
London when, at a later date, it is required to support exchange.
But Indian opinion views with suspicion the holding in London of
the greater part of India’s gold reserve, and this opinion, though
ill–founded, is likely to persist for some time to come. The amount of
expense involved in keeping gold in the Indian reserves is, in relation
to the issues involved, not great; and it might be well worth while
to incur it in order to avoid the currency system’s falling under a
suspicion, however ill–founded. It might be a satisfactory compromise,
therefore, if, as a normal practice (but not as a legal requirement),
the gold in the Gold Standard Reserve were held “ear–marked” at the
Bank of England, but the gold in the Currency Reserve retained in
India. It may be added that the authorities seem, in fact, to be moving
somewhat in this direction; for it is understood to be their intention
to accumulate £5,000,000 in gold “earmarked” for the Gold Standard
Reserve.

If, however, a large part of the gold be held in India, it is of the
utmost importance, in the event of a crisis, that the gold should be
shipped by the Government to London and sterling drafts on London
sold against it, or, if it were released in India, that the banks
only should be allowed to get it, and on an undertaking to export it.
Otherwise, if it were made freely available in India, a part might be
lost and wasted (so far as the support of exchange is concerned) in
hoards.

34. The suspicion which is felt with regard to the holding of Indian
gold in London is exceedingly natural, and can be completely dissipated
only by a fuller knowledge of the currency system and of the mechanism
of the foreign exchanges, than the generality is likely to possess.
It is natural to think that this gold is more at the disposal of the
London Money Market than it would be if it were in India, and that the
Secretary of State, under corrupt or interested pressure, can easily
place it at the disposal of London financiers. Apart from the question
how far the Secretary of State is really open to such pressure, it may
be doubted whether he is likely to be exposed to it, because at a time
of real stringency it will prove easy, I believe, for the London Market
to get hold of some part of the Indian gold, whether held in London
or in India, by perfectly legitimate means. India is normally in the
position of owing London money; this debt is discharged partly by the
consignment of goods, partly by the renewal at frequent intervals of
short loans or credits made by the London Market to the Indian Market
on bills of exchange or through the Exchange Banks, and partly by new
permanent loans. If there is great stringency in the London Market and
London is in urgent need of funds, the use of the last two methods can
be so much restricted that India can be practically forced to pay
what is owing in gold. It is, in fact, precisely because she is open
to this pressure that it is necessary for a considerable gold reserve
to be kept. So long, therefore, as the gold is freely available either
in India or in London for the support of exchange, it is unlikely
that it can be withheld from the London Money Market if this Market
really wants it. If it is in London, India will be able, by the sale
of telegraphic sterling transfers in Calcutta, to discharge her due
obligations cheaply and without delay; if it is in Calcutta, additional
charges and a loss of time must be incurred.

A feeling of jealousy on a country’s part, lest some other country
should have a lien on its gold reserve, is frequently liable to arise
at the present time, but is essentially opposed in spirit to the whole
purpose and meaning of keeping gold reserves at all. Gold reserves
are meant to be used in times of difficulty, and for the discharge of
pressing obligations. It is absurd for a man with a large balance at
his bank to default to his creditors, because a feeling of jealousy,
in regard to any one in whose favour he draws a cheque, prevents him
from ever drawing one. Mr. Bagehot certainly did England a great
service in dissipating from the minds of her financiers this primitive
prejudice;—for wonderfully few other countries have yet learnt that
gold reserves, although no doubt they serve some purpose when they are
held for show only, exist to much better purpose if they are held for
use also.

Vague stirrings of the original sin of mercantilism always inherent in
the mind of the natural man and urging him to regard gold as beyond
everything essential wealth; jealousy of the too powerful magnates of
the London Money Market obtaining what should belong to India’s Market
for their own purposes; jealousy of the Secretary of State seeming,
like a man who invests abroad, to seek in this way an independence
of India in case of trouble; jealousy of Great Britain, who might
use or regard India’s “ear–marked” gold as her own war–chest;—all
combine to make a powerful, natural, and yet unfounded prejudice
which it is exceedingly difficult to combat. Nothing is commoner than
to read incitements against malevolent financiers who would seek to
deprive India of her “fair share” of the world’s new gold. India must
be allowed, I suppose, to hug her sterile favourite. In spite of the
notorious fact that the Bank of England holds less gold than the
Central Bank of any other first–class Power,—far less even than the
Caja of the Argentine,—the belief will continue that the amount of
gold a country holds at home, rather than the degree of promptness
and certainty with which at all times it can meet its international
engagements, is the measure of its financial strength.

35. What other changes of substance might be made usefully? By far the
most important is connected with the proposed power to make advances
from the Currency Reserve on bills of exchange and other approved
security, as briefly described in Chapter III.

The policy pursued during 1912 of holding large cash balances in London
and of lending them out in the London Market provoked widespread
criticism both in India and at home. The line of thought underlying
this criticism appears to me to be entirely reasonable. If the
Government of India hold in London a penny more than is required to
establish the stability of their financial system, they are certainly
diverting resources from India, where they are greatly required, to
the detriment of India’s own trade. I do not think, however, that the
authorities are in fact open to any serious blame up to the present
time. The holding of such large balances in London has not been
part of a permanent policy, and was due in 1912 to a combination of
circumstances which could not easily have been foreseen. And further,
the Government have not until quite lately held more sterling resources
altogether than have been required for the stability of the system.
Public feeling points, nevertheless, in the direction of what, in
the future, will be the right policy. If I am right in thinking that
about £40,000,000 in the sterling Reserves is in present circumstances
adequate, further accumulations in the hands of Government ought to
be put at the disposal of the Indian Money Market and not converted
into sterling. At present there is no machinery for doing this; and
the absence of the appropriate arrangements constitutes a serious gap
in the country’s financial system. What would be thought in France or
Germany, or in any other European country, if an expansion of the note
issue could not be made against the discount of home bills, but only
against a corresponding deposit in cash cent per cent? Yet this is the
position in India. The Government (apart from their deposits in the
Presidency Banks, which will be dealt with later on) have no choice
between allowing the funds which accumulate in their hands to lie
absolutely idle in India and transferring them to London to earn a low
rate of interest there.

If the use of notes continues to increase, and if £40,000,000 is an
adequate figure for the sterling Reserves, a considerable sum may soon
be available in India from the funds of the Paper Currency Reserve.
Every addition, moreover, to the Gold Standard Reserve reduces to some
extent the need for holding large amounts of sterling in the Paper
Currency Reserve. Great advantages may be obtained if the surplus
funds in the Paper Currency Reserve be used, not as a permanent or
quasi–permanent loan to Indian traders, but to provide _elasticity_
in the seasonal supply of currency and to make possible the increase
in the stock of purchasing power in the form of money which is
_temporarily_ required in the busy season, without having to raise it
in London. _Permanent_ additions to the currency must be obtained in
the future as they are at present. But _temporary_ additions, due to
seasonal demand, ought to be provided by a suitable organisation of
credit money in India herself.

The advances from the Currency Reserve, therefore, must be made at
a fairly high rate of interest and for periods not exceeding three
months; and they should be so arranged that the Government would
regain possession of its funds and the advances be reduced to nil in
each slack season. Thus the Government would begin each busy season
with their funds intact; and they would not lend until the success of
the season was assured, and it was plain that the general position
warranted it. The advances would be made in notes or rupees, according
to the demand. These prosperity advances, therefore, are to be sharply
distinguished from the adversity advances, discussed on pp. 160–163,
which would be made in sterling drafts, and which would be governed by
wholly different considerations.

36. There remains for discussion the question of the Government’s Cash
Balances.[78] I will begin with the method of managing that part of
them which is held in India. It will be useful to know in what way this
method has grown up.[79]

When, in 1862, the right of note issue was taken away from the
Presidency Banks, they were given as part recompense the use of the
whole of that part of the Government balances which would otherwise
have been received at the General Treasury, or at places where the
Banks had branches, provided that sums in excess of a prescribed amount
(70 lakhs in the case of the Bank of Bengal), if not held in cash,
should be invested in Government paper and other authorised securities.
Difficulties very soon arose (in 1863) through the Government’s
requiring the use of its funds at a time when the Bank of Bengal
could only sell out the securities in which it had invested them at
a considerable loss. The system of virtually compelling the Banks to
lock up the Government funds in securities, not easily saleable at all
times, was plainly vicious, and in 1866 a new arrangement was made by
which the Banks were permitted to use the whole of the balances, placed
with them for the time being, for banking purposes. This seems to have
worked satisfactorily up to 1874. In that year there was a famine in
Bengal, and the Government had to buy rice in Burma and send it to
Bengal for relief purposes. The rice had to be paid for in cash; but
when the Government intimated to the Bank of Bombay that they would
have to draw out about 30 lakhs (£300,000), their balance at the Bank
then being about a crore (£1,000,000), the Bank was unable to let
them have the money. In the correspondence which the Viceroy (Lord
Northbrook) raised in regard to this, the Secretary of State (Lord
Salisbury) suggested that the Government should release themselves
from their engagement to leave their whole balances with the Banks
and that they should retain the surplus in their own Treasury, or
“lend it for short terms under suitable conditions as to interest and
security.” This interesting suggestion, closely anticipating more
recent proposals, was not acted on, the Indian authorities thinking it
improper that the Government should appear to enter into competition
with the Banks. But in 1876 the Reserve Treasury system was set up, the
Government undertaking to leave, ordinarily, certain minimum amounts at
the Banks and diverting the bulk of the rest of their funds into their
own Reserve Treasury. In 1878 it proved inconvenient to divert from the
Banks immediately the whole of the proceeds of a newly raised loan,
and the Comptroller–General was told that he “would be at liberty, to
the extent to which he could conveniently do so, to accommodate the
Banks with temporary advances from the Reserve Treasury, provided they
were willing to pay interest on such advances at the current rates.”
No special security was taken from the Banks for the sums thus lent to
them. For some time loans were freely given in this way. In 1889 the
Government declared “that any assistance in relief of the Money Market
which may be afforded by means of the Treasury Reserve can only be
made (1) through the Bank, (2) at its published rate of discount, (3)
in relief of temporary stringency.” Up to 1892, however, loans were
made as before. From 1892 to 1899 loans were made very rarely. In 1899
the Secretary of State wrote to the authorities in India:—“I see no
objection to your lending to the Presidency Banks, on the security of
Government paper, at such rates of interest from time to time and for
such periods as you think best. I am inclined to think that the rate
should, as a rule, be not below the Bank rate.” Between 1899 and 1906
such loans were made on four or five occasions; but since 1906 there
have been none. The balances left with the Banks without interest
normally exceed, however, the prescribed minima.[80]

The question of the proper employment of the Indian Cash Balances is,
therefore, a very old one, and one in regard to which the Government
have pursued no consistent policy. The effect of recent practice,
however, has been on the whole to divert more funds than formerly from
banking purposes. On the one hand the Government have been less willing
to allow the Banks loans in addition to the normal balances kept with
them, and on the other hand the general level of the cash balances has
been getting higher.

While the Government’s practice has become stricter, it is arguable,
I think, that there is less need for it. Originally, we have seen, the
Government banked with the Presidency Banks, and difficulties arose
because, the Government’s deposits bearing a high proportion to the
Bank’s total resources, it was not easy to release a large part of
these deposits suddenly. This would no longer be the case to nearly
the same extent, even if the Government were to place much larger sums
with the Banks. In 1870[81] the public deposits at £3,600,000 fell not
far short of the total private deposits and exceeded by 50 per cent
the capital and reserve of the Banks; in 1880 they were £1,900,000,
and were about one–third of the private deposits; in 1890 the figures
were £2,400,000, equal to about a quarter of the private deposits; in
1900, £1,900,000, equal to less than a quarter; in 1912 the Government
deposits at £2,500,000 were not much more than a tenth of the private
deposits. Moreover, the capital and reserves of the Banks have doubled
since 1870.

37. The portion of the Cash Balances deposited, under the above
arrangements, with the three Presidency Banks varies, of course, from
week to week. The amount normally placed with the Head Offices of the
Banks has fluctuated for some time in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000.
In addition to this, further sums, fluctuating about £1,500,000,
are held at branch offices of the Banks. These are deposited on a
different understanding (see p. 184, footnote) from that governing the
sums at the Head Offices, and are held literally at call, the amounts
at particular branches being subject to wide variations. The total sums
placed with the Banks, head and branch offices together, are usually
about £2,000,000, and the maximum deposits in recent years have been
about £3,000,000. On these deposits, as in the case of the Bank of
England and the British Government deposits, the Banks pay no interest.
The whole of the rest of the Government Balances is maintained in cash
(rupees, notes, or sovereigns) in the various Government Treasuries.
This is the present position. The Government are free in exceptional
circumstances, as we have seen above, to place additional sums with the
Presidency Banks on which interest is payable. But advantage has not
been taken of these powers recently.

38. In view of the facts mentioned at the end of § 36, I am of opinion
that the Reserve Treasury system needs reconsideration and that at
present rather more funds, perhaps, than is necessary are withdrawn
from the use of the Money Market into the Treasuries.

But the critics referred to in § 35 are following a false track when
they argue that much offence lies in the present use of the Cash
Balances, and that the main remedy for the seasonal stringency of the
Indian Money Market is to be found in lending out these balances in
India during the busy season. In thinking that any substantial remedy
is to be obtained by loans from this source, they are paying too much
attention to the transient circumstances of a single year. I believe,
for the reasons given below, that the Indian Money Market cannot expect
very much assistance from the Cash Balances, and that they have much
more to hope for in the future from the growing resources of the Paper
Currency Reserve.

Only under one or other of two conditions could loans from the Cash
Balances be important: first, if the proceeds of taxation tended to
accumulate in the Government Treasuries in the autumn and winter months
so that the balances tended to be above their normal level at the busy
season; and second, if the Government were to pursue the foolish policy
of habitually keeping more ample balances than they really required.
The first of these conditions is not fulfilled to any important extent.
The land tax is collected, naturally, _after_ the harvest has been
sold, not during it; and at the end of the calendar year the surplus
balances are small. The totals of the Indian Balances on August 1 and
January 1 of recent years are shown below:—

The total balances include the working balances in the innumerable
District Treasuries all over India and the sums already deposited with
the Presidency Banks. When, therefore, we are considering to what
extent the Government could lend at the height of the busy season, we
must chiefly pay attention to the sums in the _Reserve_ Treasuries on
January 1. The above figures show conclusively that, as a rule, the
Indian Money Market cannot expect substantial assistance from this
source at the time of year when it is most needed. Except in 1913,[82]
the resources of the Reserve Treasuries on January 1 have been in
recent years between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000.

After January 1, it is true, the revenue comes in rapidly.[83] But as
a matter of fact, the funds which accumulate from the proceeds of
revenue between January and April are quickly released and returned to
the Money Market, as matters now are, through the encashment of the
Council Bills which are generally sold in large quantities at this
time of year. If this money were to be released by loan instead of by
the encashment of Council Bills, the effect would be that less funds
would be remitted to London; and unless we assume that more funds are
being remitted to London than are really required, this would put the
Secretary of State to inconvenience in meeting the Home Charges. Only
in years when sufficient funds had been remitted to London earlier in
the financial year, therefore, would surplus funds be available in the
Indian Treasury to any important extent even in the latter half of the
busy season.

I do not say that the Government should not lend from the Cash Balances
in India whenever exceptional circumstances may lead to their being
at an unnecessarily high level in the busy season. But the sums which
could be lent in this way would not generally be important, and the
amount of elasticity which the financial system could gain by these
loans would be small compared with what it might acquire from a reform
of the Paper Currency Reserve. I should prefer, therefore, that the
Indian Cash Balances should be held, so far as possible, in notes, thus
increasing the capacity of the Currency Reserve, and that all advances
should be made in form from the Currency Reserve. The question of the
use of funds in the Cash Balances would then lapse into the question
of the use of funds in the Paper Currency Reserve. But if a different
system of book–keeping be preferred, no substantial change is involved
in what I propose. The method of loaning from the Currency Reserve is
applicable _mutatis mutandis_ to loans from the Cash Balances.

39. Of the Cash Balances in London no more than a working account is
kept with the Bank of England. The manner in which the rest is dealt
with is best described in the words of an official memorandum issued by
the India Office in 1913 [Cd. 6619]:—

 The practice followed since 1838 has been to keep a certain part of
 the balance at the Bank (of England) and to lend the remainder at
 interest. The usual method is to lend to certain banks, discount
 houses, and stock–brokers of high standing, whose names are included
 in an approved list, now containing sixty–two names. The list is
 revised periodically, and applications for admission are carefully
 considered with reference to the standing and resources of the
 applicants and the nature of their business. Loans to borrowers on the
 approved list are granted as a rule for periods from three to five
 weeks, occasionally for six weeks, so that the whole balance could, if
 needed, be called in within six weeks. The Accountant–General informs
 the Secretary of State’s broker daily of the amount of loans that
 may be renewed, the amount of new loans that may be placed, or the
 amount that must be called. The broker is responsible for obtaining
 the best possible rate of interest. The amount of a loan is not paid
 out from the Secretary of State’s account at the Bank of England until
 the security has been lodged at the Bank. In 1909 it was found that
 the borrowers on the approved list could not take the full amount of
 the balances available for loan; and, in order to obtain employment
 for the funds, the broker was instructed, as a temporary measure, to
 deposit the excess amount from time to time with leading London banks,
 usually for periods of between one and three months.

40. In the autumn of 1912 a determined attack was made, in the Press
and by means of questions in the House of Commons, on the management of
the English Balances, as described above, and on their amount. Many of
the questions were framed rather with some other object than to elicit
information. But they undoubtedly had the result that the authorities
published to the public much ampler details than were previously
available. A valuable summary of these will be found in the official
memorandum [Cd. 6619] from which I have just quoted.[84] As the outcome
of this very full inquisition into the whole subject, only two points
have emerged in which, in my opinion, the authorities are open to
criticism in detail—_i.e._, apart from wide questions of policy. They
renewed India Bills (which were eventually paid off in December 1912)
when they could have very well afforded to discharge them. If the
season of 1912–13 had been a bad one, or if their expectations had been
upset in any other way, it would always have been open to the India
Council to issue the Bills afresh. Their action appears to the outside
critic to have been one of ill–considered caution. The other point is a
trifle and reflects, perhaps, on a curiosity of our economic organism
rather than on the India Office. It was slightly shocking to discover
that the Government broker, who is not even a whole–time officer, and
has a separate business of his own besides his official duties, is the
highest paid[85] official of the Government with the sole exception of
the Viceroy. He has probably been paid too high even on current city
standards. But it suggests once again the old question how long it will
be found necessary to pay city men so entirely out of proportion to
what other servants of society commonly receive for performing social
services not less useful or difficult.

41. Some of the conclusions of this chapter may be summarised. All
countries, since the practice has been generally adopted of employing a
medium of exchange composed of some cheaper material than the standard
of value, must keep a monetary reserve. Where there is a State bank,
the bank is usually entrusted with this duty. Where the State regulates
the currency and the note issue without the intervention of a bank, the
State must itself undertake it. The proper magnitude of the reserve
must depend upon the particular circumstances of each country. In India
the reserve must be unusually large, first, because India is a great
country specially liable to wide fluctuations in her prosperity and
trade on account of climatic conditions the character of which cannot
be easily foreseen; and second, because a large amount of foreign
capital is employed, not only in permanent investment, but in temporary
loans withdrawable at short notice, and because against these foreign
liabilities India holds no appreciable amount of international Stock
Exchange securities capable of easy realisation. I have argued that
£40,000,000 may be, perhaps, at present a suitable amount to be held
by Government in its sterling Reserves. These Reserves are most useful
if they are held in London, where they must necessarily be wanted
whenever there is need to make use of them. In deference to a public
opinion which does not clearly understand the purpose of the Reserves
or the limitations under which the Secretary of State must needs act
in managing his sterling resources, it may be worth while to allay a
groundless suspicion by the compromise of holding a fair proportion
of the reserve of actual gold coin in India herself. When a Reserve
of some such amount as the above has been firmly established, the
diversion of further funds into any form of sterling or into the London
Market should be deliberately avoided.

Stability has been attained already, or is about to be. So, on the
whole, has economy, though some current opinion in regard to the
use of gold puts it in jeopardy. The system still wants elasticity.
A machinery ought to be set up, therefore, by which further funds,
accumulating in the hands of Government through the increased use of
notes, may be used in India to afford the needed elasticity in the
seasonal supply of currency.

Let the Indian public learn that it is extravagant to use gold as a
medium of exchange, foolish to lessen the utility of their reserves
through suspicion of the London Money Market, and highly advantageous
to their own trade and to the resources of their own money market to
develop the use of notes; and their financial system may soon become
wonderfully well adapted to the particular circumstances of their
situation. The history of the last twelve years has been transitional.
The authorities have been—wisely—building up the reserves they ought
to have. This process has necessarily diverted funds from the Indian
Money Market, and has naturally excited some measure of opposition. But
the fruits of cautious growth may soon be reaped.




CHAPTER VII

INDIAN BANKING


1. In passing from Currency and the Finance of Government to the
kindred topic of Banking, we come to a part of the subject where
statistics and other information are much less freely available to
the outside critic. The published figures are not adequate to tell us
much of what we require to know, and the literature of Indian Banking
is almost non–existent. I must run the risk, therefore, of sometimes
falling into errors of fact, and hope that, if these errors provoke
criticism, they will bring to light the true facts at the same time.

2. The Money Market and Banking System of India comprises the following
as its four main constituents:—

(i.) The Presidency Banks; (ii.) the European Exchange Banks; (iii.)
the Indian Joint Stock Banks; and (iv.) the Shroffs, Marwaris, and
other private bankers and money–lenders.

The first two of these constitute what we may term the European
Money Market, and the rest, under the leadership of Marwaris and
Parsees, the Indian or Native Money Market,—up–country Banks such as
the Allahabad Bank and the Alliance Bank of Simla, which are Indian
Joint Stock Banks under European management, occupying, perhaps, an
intermediate position. The local money markets, outside the main towns
in which European business men have offices and where the bulk of the
foreign trade is handled, are entirely in the hands of Indians.

3. How close a connexion exists between the two money markets—native
and European—how nearly the rates ruling in one agree with those in
the other, and how readily capital flows from one to the other, I am
not clear. Some evidence bearing on these points was laid before the
Fowler Committee of 1898, but such facts are now fifteen years old.
In the pre–1899 period it was not uncommon in times of stringency
for the bazaar rate to be appreciably lower than the Presidency Bank
rate, and the connexion between the two money markets seems to have
been very incomplete. The following quotation from a letter by Mr. J.
H. Sleigh, Secretary and Treasurer of the Bank of Bombay, written in
1898 (reprinted in the Appendix to the Fowler Committee’s Report), is
interesting:—

 During the last export season, Shroffs’ 60 days’ sight bills were
 not obtainable over 8 per cent discount.... This was the rate then
 ruling in the native bazaar both in Bombay and Calcutta, and that,
 too, while the Exchange Banks were greedy to receive fixed deposits
 for short periods at 9, 10, and even 11 per cent per annum, and
 while the Presidency Banks were straining to meet the demands for
 loans at 12 and 13 per cent per annum. But there is no singularity
 in these facts. The same peculiarity has shown itself over and over
 again during periods of financial pressure; and even at the present
 moment (November 1898), while money is not by any means tight, there
 exists a difference of about 2 per cent between the bazaar and the
 Presidency Bank rates. I have ever found that when the official rate
 rose abnormally high, the rate in the native market did not respond
 to the full extent, but generally stopped at 7 or 8 per cent, though
 the Presidency Banks’ rate might rise to 10 or 12 per cent. The
 explanation is simple. The Shroffs, who finance nearly the whole of
 the internal trade of India, rarely, if ever, discount European Paper
 and never purchase foreign or sterling bills. Neither do they lend
 money on Government Paper or similar securities, but confine their
 advances to the discount of _hoondees_, to loans to cultivators, and
 against gold and silver bullion. The _hoondees_ they purchase are for
 the most part those of traders, small and large, at rates of discount
 ranging from 9 to 25 per cent per annum, but the _hoondees_ they buy
 and sell to each other, which are chiefly the traders’ _hoondees_
 bearing the Shroffs’ own endorsements, rule the rates in the native
 bazaar, and are generally negotiated, during the busy season, at from
 5 to 8 per cent discount. They also discount their endorsements pretty
 largely with the Presidency Banks when rates are low, and discontinue
 doing so when they rise above 6 per cent. They also speculate largely
 at times in Government Paper, especially during the off season, but
 rarely or ever hold it or lend on it.

I have seen no evidence for supposing that the general conditions
outlined in this quotation do not still hold; but in recent years
the Presidency Bank rates have not risen above 9 per cent, and
occasions for the operation of the tendencies described above have
been rarer. The conditions prevailing in the Indian Money Market in
the period immediately preceding 1898 were in many respects very
abnormal. I suspect that the rates in the two markets may appear to
be more different than they really are, and are explicable by the
difference of the conditions and of security, subject to which business
is transacted. It is, however, plain that the main movements of the
interest rate up and down, which result from the central facts of the
Indian seasons and harvests, must be the same in both markets, and that
the Native Money Market must ultimately depend on the European for
additional supplies of cash.

4. As I am chiefly interested in the Indian Banking System, so far
as this book is concerned, from the point of view of its effect on
the remittance of funds to and from India, I shall be concerned for
the most part with what I have called the European Money Market—the
Presidency and Exchange Banks. But an Indian writer, in a position to
know the facts, could throw much useful light on a question where I
must necessarily be content with somewhat doubtful conjecture.

5. The Presidency Bank of Bengal was opened in 1806 and received its
charter of incorporation from the East India Company in 1809.[86] The
first Bank of Bombay[87] was established under a similar charter in
1840, and the Bank of Madras in 1843. The establishment of these Banks
in the other Presidencies put an end to the possibility that the Bank
of Bengal might become a Bank for all India. The Presidency Banks had,
at first, a semi–official character. At the foundation of the Bank of
Bengal, the East India Company contributed one–fifth (the proportion
became smaller subsequently) of the capital and appointed three of the
directors. Up to the time of the Mutiny the office of Secretary and
Treasurer was held by a Covenanted Civilian.

Up to 1862 the Banks had the right of note issue; but this right was
so hedged about by a restriction of the total liabilities payable on
demand to a certain multiple (at first three times, later four times)
of the cash reserve, and of the total liabilities of all kinds to the
amount of the Bank’s capital (up to 1839), or of the total note issue
to a fixed amount (from 1839 to 1862), that the note issue of the
Presidency Banks never became important. In 1862 the management of the
note issue was taken over by the Government in the manner described
in Chapter III. At the same time the right of note issue by private
Banks was finally abolished.[88] In 1876 the Government relinquished
their share of the capital of the Banks and their right of appointing
directors.[89] Since then the Presidency Banks have lost their official
character, but remain distinct from other Banks in that they are
governed by a special Charter Act (the Presidency Banks Act of 1876).

6. The Presidency Banks have worked from the beginning under very
rigorous restrictions as to the character of the business which they
might undertake. These restrictions were originally due partly,
perhaps, to a feeling of jealousy on the part of the Court of Directors
of the East India Company lest the Banks should compete in business
(such as foreign exchange) which the Company regarded as its own;
but chiefly from a proper wish that semi–official institutions, in a
country so dangerous for banking as India, should be conducted on the
safest possible principles.[90] An exceedingly interesting history of
the restrictions is to be found in Mr. Brunyate’s _Account_. In 1862
they were greatly relaxed, but the most important limitations were
reimposed in 1876.[91] Since that time only minor charges have been
effected.

7. The principal restrictions on the Presidency Banks are now the
following:—

(i.) The Banks may not draw, discount, buy, or sell bills of exchange
or other negotiable securities _unless they are payable in India_[92]
or in Ceylon; this restriction has cut off the Presidency Banks
completely from dealing in sterling drafts or any kind of foreign
exchange; (ii.) they may not borrow, or receive deposits payable,
outside India, or maintain a foreign branch or agency for this or
similar purposes, and they are thus prevented from raising funds in
London for use in India[93]; (iii.) they may not lend for a longer
period than six months[94]; (iv.) or upon mortgage, or in any other
manner upon the security of immovable property; (v.) or upon promissory
notes bearing less than two independent names; (vi.) or upon personal
security; (vii.) or upon goods, unless the goods, or the title to them,
are deposited with the Bank as security.

The fifth of these provisions allows a loophole by means of which the
rules can be made to work in practice less rigorously than appears on
paper. Any two names will satisfy the letter of the Presidency Banks
Act; but any two names are not necessarily very good security. After
getting two names to satisfy the Act, the authorities of the Banks can
then proceed to satisfy the dictates of cautious banking by taking, as
well, some of the other kinds of security upon which, technically, they
are forbidden to lend. It is an excellent instance of the consequences
of an attempt to control banking by an elaborate Act forty years old.
The last provision has led, I believe, to the Banks establishing a kind
of bonded warehouse for the reception of merchandise. In other cases
the borrower’s own mill or warehouse is made to serve the purpose by
the expedient of the Bank’s paying the wages of his watchman. Where
the personal security of the borrower is obviously good, there must be
a temptation to allow him to value the goods generously, rather than
to put the Bank to the inconvenience of housing or watching a greater
bulk of merchandise.

As some recompense for these restrictions, the Presidency Banks have
been allowed to hold a portion of the Government balances without
payment of interest. The use of these balances was first granted them
in 1862 as compensation for their being deprived of the right of
note issue. Up to 1876 the Presidency Banks held, subject to certain
conditions, the _whole_ of the Government balances which would have
been “paid in ordinary course into Government Treasuries at the
places where the head offices and branch offices of the Banks are
established.” But on more than one occasion the Banks made difficulties
when the Government desired to withdraw large sums at short notice. In
1876, therefore, the Reserve Treasuries were established, and since
that time only a portion of the balances has been placed with the
Banks.[95]

8. The present constitution of the Presidency Banks is to be explained,
therefore, by their long and complicated history. The restrictions
under which they work have in the past contributed, beyond doubt,
to their stability. The Bank of Bengal has seen the rise and fall
of numerous powerful rivals. Only by virtue of its being absolutely
precluded by law from the more speculative forms of business, has
this Bank survived the half–dozen or more violent crises by which the
Indian financial system has been assailed in the last hundred years.
And, in spite of the restrictions, the Presidency Banks have shown
great vitality and a power of expansion hardly less than that of the
Exchange Banks in the happier circumstances of the last decade. But
their constitutions are exceedingly out of date at the present time.
The considerations which originally gave rise to them are no longer
operative;—since the introduction of the Gold Standard, for example,
dealing in foreign exchange has ceased to be a highly speculative
business. And they do not play as useful a part in the Indian Financial
System, as with a different history behind them they might do.

(a) An exceptional year, due to the excessive abundance of money.

(b) The figures for 1911 and 1912 are not taken from the same returns
as the rest, and are not quite strictly comparable with them in one or
two details.

These figures do not require much comment. The growth of private
deposits since 1900 (rising from £8,500,000 in 1900 to £15,000,000
in 1905 and £24,000,000 in 1912) is very noticeable. This has been
accompanied by a fair increase of Capital and Reserve and of Cash.
The Presidency Banks publish weekly statements of their affairs, and
it is scarcely possible, therefore, that they should “window–dress”
their balance sheets. The figures given above refer to December 31,
which falls in the busy season; and the proportion of cash held affords
no ground of complaint. It should be said, however, that, while the
public deposits at the head offices are stable and not liable to
sudden reduction, the public deposits at the branch offices stand in a
different position and are held literally at call. It is necessary for
the Banks to hold a considerable proportion of these in cash at the
branches in question, and this arrangement makes the cash held against
the private deposits appear in a somewhat more favourable light than it
should. It must also be remembered that the Presidency Banks are to a
certain extent Bankers’ Banks, and that the other Indian Banks reckon
their balances with the Presidency Banks (included in the private
deposits) as part of their cash.

10. The two provisions of the Presidency Banks Act which have proved
fundamental in their effect on the development of the Indian Banking
System are those which prohibit the Presidency Banks from dealing in
foreign exchange and from raising funds in London. To transact these
two classes of business—though once established they have not limited
their transactions to them—a class of Banks has arisen known as the
Exchange Banks. Officially a Bank is an Exchange Bank if its head
office is located elsewhere than in India; but Banks in this category
coincide very nearly with Banks doing the class of business described
above. The Indian Specie Bank is the only Indian Joint Stock Bank
having a branch office in London; but this is probably in connexion
with its business in silver and pearls, and this Bank does not transact
any considerable volume of business of the kind undertaken by Exchange
Banks.

11. The Exchange Banks proper fall into two groups—those doing
a considerable proportion of their total business in India, and
those which are no more than agencies of large banking corporations
doing business all over Asia. This second group includes the
Comptoir National d’Escompte de Paris, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the
Deutsch–Asiatische Bank, the International Banking Corporation, and the
Russo–Asiatic Bank. These Banks represent in India French, Japanese,
German, American, and Russian interests respectively. No figures are
published of the proportion of their total business which these Banks
transact in India. But I should be surprised if, even in the case of
the Yokohama Specie Bank, it would amount to more than five to ten
per cent; and in the case of some of them it must be much less than
this. In what follows, therefore, I shall leave these five Banks out of
account.

In the first group there are six Banks—the Delhi and London Bank
(1844), the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China (1853), the
National Bank of India (1863), the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (1864), the Mercantile Bank of India (1893[97]), and the
Eastern Bank (1910). The dates after these Banks give the years when
they were established. Of these, two, the Chartered and the Hong Kong
Banks, do a very large business in other parts of the East, especially
China[98]; but this does not prevent their Indian connexion from being
important. The other four are primarily Indian.[99] It is noticeable
that no entirely new Exchange Bank now surviving[100] was founded
between 1864 and 1910. This is in spite of the fact that most of the
above, especially in the last decade, have proved enormously successful
from the point of view of their shareholders. The Delhi and London
Bank,[101] the oldest established of all, has not shown the vitality
or power of expansion of the others; and the Eastern Bank, though it
seems to have made a good start, is still too young to pass judgment
on. But the shares of the rest, if the issue of bonus shares be allowed
for, stand at a premium of about 200 per cent or more. It is probable,
however, that it would be exceedingly difficult to start a new Exchange
Bank at the present time, except under the aegis of some important
financial house already established in a strong position in India.[102]
Indian Exchange Banking is no business for speculative or enterprising
outsiders, and the large profits which it earns are protected by
established and not easily assailable advantages.

12. This summary leads us, therefore, to the important conclusion that
the business of financing Indian trade, so far as it is carried out by
Banks with their seat in London,[103] is in the hands of a very small
number of Banks. They stand, broadly speaking, in an exceedingly strong
financial position supported by large reserve funds. In this matter
India is now enjoying the fruit of past disasters and of conditions in
which the struggle for existence was too keen to allow any but the
fittest to survive. If the present spell of prosperity lasts too long,
she will no doubt lose it.

13. I shall not attempt any complete account of the activities of a
typical Exchange Bank. Much of their business is very like that of
any other Bank. But it will be worth while to describe in rather more
detail the most characteristic part of their transactions and the part
which is most relevant to the topics of this book.

14. In addition to its capital and the reserves accumulated from
profits, an Exchange Bank obtains its funds by receiving deposits
either for fixed periods or on current account. These deposits are
received both in India and in London; but it is a principal object of
Exchange Banks to obtain as much as they can in London, and they seek
to attract such deposits by offering better terms than an English Bank
will allow. On fixed deposits, received for a year or more, 4 or 3½
per cent will be paid; for shorter periods a more variable rate; and
on current accounts 2 per cent will be allowed on the minimum monthly
balance or on the amount by which the balance exceeds a certain fixed
minimum. Apart from the cash, money at call, and investments, which
every Bank must hold, a certain part of these funds are employed in
making loans either in India or elsewhere. But a large part is employed
in the purchase (or discount) of bills of exchange. Some of these
bills will be negotiated in London and drawn on India, but the bulk of
them will be negotiated in India and drawn on London. A busy Exchange
Bank discounts far more of these trade bills in India than it can
afford to hold until maturity. But as they are drawn on London houses
there is no difficulty in rediscounting them in London. As the majority
of the bills are bought by the Banks _in India_, while cash is received
for them, either at maturity or through rediscount, _in London_, the
Banks are constantly in the position of finding themselves in funds in
London and of wishing to have funds (for the purchase of more bills) in
India. They proceed, therefore, to even up their accounts as between
London and India by buying, in London, Council Bills (or transfers) or
sovereigns (from the Bank of England or from the agents of Egyptian or
Australian Banks) for delivery in India, or, perhaps, silver (though
their dealings in silver bullion are probably much less important than
formerly)[104] for remittance to India. The question of what determines
the relative advantages of these methods has been discussed in Chapter
V.

The demand for Council Bills, therefore, chiefly depends on how much
new business the Exchange Banks are entering into in India. The method
of telegraphic transfers enables them to act with great despatch on
receiving advices from their Indian agents. The Indian branches obtain
immediately the funds enabling them to take the trade bills, the offer
of which had seemed to them to be at sufficiently satisfactory rates
to make the transaction taken as a whole worth while. A few weeks
later the bills reach England, are duly accepted, and are capable of
being rediscounted if the Bank needs additional free funds to buy more
Council Bills and turn its money over again in another transaction of
the same kind.

We are now in a position to understand what the Secretary of State
means when he says that he has sold bills to meet the needs of trade.
If he withdraws the convenience of telegraphic transfers or forces
the Banks to put themselves in funds in India by sending sovereigns,
he causes delay or additional expense in the discounting of bills in
India. In other words, Indian traders are less easily able to turn the
goods they are exporting into money. On the other hand, if the Indian
season is a poor one and the exports fall off, the offer of bills for
discount is reduced and the need of the Exchange Banks in London to buy
Council Bills correspondingly less.

It is worth noticing that, from the point of view of the London Money
Market as a whole, it is a mere difference of machinery whether the
Exchange Banks finance the Indian trade by attracting deposits in
London and hold the bills themselves, or whether the Discount Houses
and London Banks attract the deposits and use them to rediscount bills
for the Exchange Banks. In so far as the Exchange Banks can attract
deposits themselves without paying too high a rate for them, this
alternative is usually the more profitable for them,—especially since,
if they are able to hold in this way a considerable proportion of the
bills they discount, they can afford to wait for a favourable moment
before rediscounting such bills as they have eventually to dispose of.
But, apart from private profits, the important point is the extent
to which Indian trade is financed by the purchase of Council Bills
in London with borrowed money, whether this money is supplied by the
depositors in Exchange Banks or by those who rediscount the bills.

15. There is, _prima facie_, some danger to the stability of the
Indian financial system in the fact that its money market is largely
financed by funds raised, not permanently but for short periods, in a
far–distant foreign centre.[105] In order to judge accurately whether
this danger is in any way a real one, it would be necessary to have
before us certain facts which are not ordinarily published. We do not
know what proportion of the Exchange Banks’ total deposits are held in
England; or to what extent those which are so held are fixed for a
year or more and how far they are at call or short notice. As is often
the case when banking is under discussion in other countries, those
who are in a position to know are not in a position to speak, while
those who are in a position to speak are not in a position to know. I
will make my guess for what it is worth in § 18. In the meantime let us
discuss the principle which should guide us, had we knowledge.

It is plain that if Banks were to borrow money at short notice in
England and use it in India—certainly if they were to do this on a
large scale,—the situation might be dangerous. They might be called on
to return what they had borrowed in England, and unable at short notice
to bring back what they had lent in India. The principle of which we
are in search is, therefore, that the sums borrowed on relatively short
notice in either country should not exceed the assets located there.
Where, however, bills of exchange between England and India are in
question, it is not immediately plain what part of the Banks’ funds may
properly be regarded as located in England and what part in India. The
answer is, I think, that a bill which has been accepted in England, and
is payable there at maturity, is an English asset, wherever it may have
been originally negotiated. Thus in the case of Indian Exchange Banks,
their deposits in London (other than those fixed for long periods)
should be at least balanced by their short–term loans in London,
their cash in London, their portfolio of trade bills having a London
domicile, and such of their securities as may be readily marketable in
London. Similarly their liquid assets in India should at least balance
their short–period liabilities there.

16. How far these conditions are as a matter of fact satisfied, it is,
as I have said above, impossible to know for certain. The Exchange
Banks do not distinguish in their published accounts between their
Indian and London deposits. They do, however, give private information
to the Indian authorities of their deposits in India and elsewhere
respectively in each year. These aggregates for all the Exchange Banks
together are published in the _Statistics of British India_, Part II.,
and are, therefore, available to the public two or three years after
the period to which they refer.[106]

So far as the Indian deposits are concerned, these returns are very
valuable. But the aggregate of deposits outside India is as nearly
as possible useless. For Exchange Banks of both groups—the Banks
primarily Indian and the agencies of huge European institutions doing
business in many parts of the world—are lumped together, so that
the total includes the whole of the French deposits of the Comptoir
National d’Escompte and of the deposits, in whatever country, of the
other Banks with Indian agencies enumerated on p. 206. The figures
are, therefore, hardly relevant to questions peculiarly Indian; and I
will content myself with quoting, from the table given in the official
statistics, the total deposits of Exchange Banks made _in India_, and
the cash balances held _in India_ against them.

17. Two facts emerge from this table with great plainness—the rapid
rate at which in recent years Exchange Banks have been able to increase
the funds raised by deposit in India herself, and the slow rate at
which they have thought fit to increase their Indian balances.[107] The
position has evidently changed a good deal in quite recent times. It is
tantalising to think that two years must elapse before we can know how
the Banks stood in these respects last December (1912). The _Statistics
of British India_ do not lend their aid to ruder hands than those of
the historian.

In the event of an internal financial crisis in India the Exchange
Banks are probably depending on the anticipation that they will be
able to remit funds from London by telegraphic transfer. In this case
they rely on not being hard pressed in India and in London at the same
time. An Indian reserve, such as they appear to keep, of from 18 to 20
per cent would be respectable, for example, in England. But in such a
country as India, where banking is ill–established and hoarding more
than a memory, the proportion held in reserve seems somewhat lower than
perhaps it ought to be. Possibly Exchange Banks have already been in
smooth waters longer than is for their good. There are famous dates in
the history of Indian banking which should serve as a _memento mori_.

18. When we turn to the assets and liabilities of the Exchange Banks in
England we find reason for supposing a much stronger position; for the
bulk of the bills of exchange held are probably domiciled in London and
may be regarded, therefore, as liquid London assets.[108] The following
table sets out the figures relating to deposits, leaving out the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, because, although its Indian
business is important, this can only be a small proportion of its total
business. I include all the other Banks given in my first group (see
p. 207) although the non–Indian business of the Chartered and National
Banks cannot be accurately allowed for.

The total cash in hand and at bankers held by these five Banks at the
end of 1912 was about £m7¾. I estimate that in 1910 these Banks may
have held _outside India_ about £m23 in deposits and about £m5 cash in
hand and at bankers.

As to the proportion of these deposits which were held for long periods
there is no accurate information. The Chartered and Eastern Banks
are alone in distinguishing in their balance sheets between fixed
deposits and current accounts. In 1912 the Chartered Bank held £m10½
on current account, etc., and £m7½ on fixed deposit; the Eastern
Bank £m½ on current account and £m1½ on fixed deposit.[109]
More than half of the deposits of the Banks as a whole are probably
held on current account or at short notice. If we are to make a
guess, the Banks may have held in 1910 about £13,000,000 on current
account outside India; but by no means all of this (in the case of the
Chartered and National Banks especially) would be held in London. The
question of the amount of the London assets of the Banks does not lend
itself to statistical summary. But I do not think that there is the
least reason for supposing that the position is not a strong one.

19. The principles which underlie the preceding analysis may be
illustrated by reference to a hypothetical balance sheet, simplified,
but less simplified than those commonly published.

               [Bills rediscounted and outstanding, £m5½.]

Acceptances have been omitted in the above, the amount of bills
payable is supposed to be deducted from cash, and various minor items
are omitted. The “capital employed in India” seems to be (viii.) +
(x.) + (xii.) = £m5. The “capital employed in London” is (vii.) +
(ix.)–(vi.) + (xi.) = £m5½.[110] The securities and miscellaneous
assets (xiii.) + (xiv.) = £m1½, may be regarded perhaps as equally
available in either centre. If there is a run in India, assets must
be available there in a liquid form equal to (v.). If there is a run
in London, liquid assets must be available there equal to (iii.). The
second condition, but not the first, is, in this hypothetical example,
fulfilled. If the Bank had to remit funds back from India to London,
this would be most simply effected by not entering into new business
under (ix.). It would not then be necessary to buy Council Bills,
and the trade bills already bought under (ix.), being rediscounted or
allowed to mature in London, would swell the available funds there
automatically. If it were possible to call in loans in India and
reduce (viii.), then it would be possible to buy more trade bills
under (ix.) in India (or Government sterling drafts if trade were
depressed), without having to buy Council Bills in London, and these
trade bills could then be rediscounted in London. If the Exchange Banks
are remitting funds back to London, this shows itself, therefore, in a
poor demand for Council Bills; and conversely when they are remitting
funds to India, there is a strong demand for Council Bills. Thus the
weakness of the demand for Council Bills in times of depression (and
the strength of the demand for Government sterling drafts) partly
depends on the action of the Exchange Banks. What their action would be
in a situation of acute stringency bordering on financial panic, it is
not easy to predict.

20. So far the only apparent element of danger in the banking position
seems to lie in the growth of deposits attracted by the Exchange
Banks in India without a corresponding growth in their Indian cash
reserves. It would be a good thing if the Exchange Banks were compelled
to distinguish in their balance sheets between their Indian and
extra–Indian business, much in the manner set out in the hypothetical
balance sheet on p. 218, except that for “London” “outside India”
would have to be substituted.[111] They should also distinguish, as two
already do distinguish, between fixed deposits and accounts at call
or for short periods. When, as in the case of the Exchange Banks, we
have to deal with a small number of Banks of established position, an
insistence on due publicity, rather than compulsion or regulation in
matters of policy, is likely to be the proper remedy for any weaknesses
which may possibly exist.

21. The next section of the Indian banking world comprises the Indian
Joint Stock Banks, _i.e._ those Banks, other than the three Presidency
Banks, registered in India and having their head offices there. This
is a confusing group, because a great number of small money–lending
establishments are registered as Banks under the Indian Companies
Act—in 1910–11 492 businesses were classified as Banks.[112] The
official statistics separate off, however, those of the Banks proper
which are of any considerable size,—those, namely, which have a
paid–up capital and reserve of at least 5 lakhs (£33,000).

The earlier Banks, coming under this description, were usually under
European management. Out of seven existing in 1870, only two now
survive,—the Bank of Upper India (1863) and the Allahabad Bank
(1865).[113] Between 1870 and 1894 seven more Banks, conforming on the
whole to this same type, were founded, of which four now survive,—the
Alliance Bank of Simla (1874), the Oudh Commercial Bank (1881),
the Punjab Banking Company (1889), and the Punjab National Bank
(1894).[114] All these Banks are on a very small scale compared with
the Presidency and Exchange Banks; but they are distinguished in type
from most of the more recent creations.

Between 1894 and 1904[115] no new Banks were founded with as much as
5 lakhs of paid–up capital. But since 1904 there has been a great
outburst of fresh activity, and a type of Bank new to India has become
important. The way was led in 1904 by the foundation of the Bank of
Burma. This Bank failed in 1911, two directors and the general manager
being found guilty of cheating and sentenced to imprisonment in 1913.
In 1906 three Banks were founded, all of some importance,—the Bank of
India (under important Parsee auspices), the Bank of Rangoon, and the
Indian Specie Bank. Until 1910 these three Banks remained alone amongst
the new creations in having a paid–up capital in excess of 15 lakhs
(£100,000).[116] Since 1906 numerous Banks have been started, amongst
the most important of which in respect of paid–up capital may be
mentioned the Bengal National Bank (1907), the Bombay Merchants’ Bank
(1909), the Credit Bank of India (1909), the Kathiawar and Ahmedabad
Banking Corporation (1910), and the Central Bank of India (1911).

The main object of most of these Banks is, of course, to attract
deposits (though some of them are almost as much concerned at present
with placing a further part of their unissued capital). For deposits
fixed for a year the rate offered varies, as a rule, from 4½ to 5
per cent, the newer creations generally favouring the higher rate.
Some Banks offer 6 per cent. About the rates for shorter periods
there is more vagueness. On current accounts 2 per cent is generally
allowed, though the eagerness of some of the newest Banks has led
them to offer 2½. I have the advertisement before me of a Bank
which offers 3 per cent on the daily balance, and up to 6 per cent on
sums deposited for longer periods; at the head of the advertisement
appears in large letters—Capital, Rs. 50,000,000; but it appears below
that applications for shares are invited, and the paid–up capital is
probably negligible. Some Banks advertise such advantages as “Special
Marriage Deposits, 50 per cent added to Principal in five years’
time.”[117]

4½ per cent on deposits fixed for a year and 2 per cent on current
accounts in excess of a certain minimum are very likely reasonable
rates to offer in Indian conditions, provided that the funds thus
attracted are not used for speculation and that adequate reserves
are maintained in a liquid form. It is in this respect that the more
substantial of these Banks are chiefly open to criticism. The official
statistics are, unfortunately, very much out of date. But for the
Banks which had a paid–up capital and reserve of at least 5 lakhs the
available figures up to 1910 are as follows:—

22. These figures reveal, in my opinion, an exceedingly serious state
of affairs. If they could be brought up to date, they would probably
appear even worse. As late as 1900 these Banks were comparatively
insignificant. Since that time they have succeeded in attracting so
large a volume of deposits as to make them an important part of the
banking system of the country. Only six of them date back long enough
to remember any real financial crisis in India (for the depression
of 1907–8 was not accompanied by the symptoms of financial crisis).
Growing up in smooth times, they have thought more of attracting
deposits than of retaining cash reserves; and in 1910 we find sixteen
Banks with deposits of £17,000,000 and cash reserves of not quite 11
per cent.[118] Even of these reserves the greater part is probably held
by the older and more established of the Banks belonging to this class.
In the case of the smaller Banks, dealing, as they are, with clients to
whom banking is a new thing and in a country where hoarding is still
dominant, the cash balances seem, from the available indications, to
be hopelessly inadequate; and it is hard to doubt that in the next bad
times they will go down like ninepins. If such a catastrophe occurs,
the damage inflicted on India will be far greater than the direct loss
falling on the depositors. The growth of banking habits in India is, of
course, of the utmost importance to the country’s economic development.
A startling series of failures will do much to retard it.

In this connexion the history of the Bank of Burma, the first Bank of
the new order to be founded, is instructive. This Bank was started
in 1904 under European management by a firm engaged in floating
oil companies and other highly speculative enterprises. The Bank’s
capital was £117,500, and by 1911, when it failed, deposits had been
attracted to the extent of £792,701, a large part of which is said to
have come from Bombay and Calcutta. To obtain these deposits the Bank
had offered interest at the rate of 6 per cent for deposits placed
with it for a year; and many persons, it seems, were deceived by its
title into believing that it was in some sense a Presidency Bank. In
the autumn of 1911, after a year in which the Burma rice crop had been
good and had sold at very high prices, and when the province generally
was prosperous, the Bank failed. The balance sheet turned out to be
false, and one–third of the assets had been advanced against worthless
security to a firm in which the directors were interested.

23. Both in the case of the Exchange Banks and in that of the
Indian Joint Stock Banks, the “Cash Balances” include, I think,
balances held at other Banks.[119] It is impossible, therefore, to
summarise accurately the figures for the Indian Banking System as
a whole—Presidency Banks, Exchange Banks, and Joint Stock Banks
together. The figures given below state accurately the total of private
deposits; but in the total of cash balances some items must be counted
twice over.

  (a) An exceptional year.

The steady deterioration of the position, as shown in the above
figures, is exceedingly marked. These figures flatter the Banks, rather
than the reverse. For I have excluded the Public Deposits (amounting in
1910 to £2,820,000), and have included the whole of the cash balances
(at the branches as well as the head offices) held by the Presidency
Banks against them. If the figures could be worked out accurately, the
present proportion of cash available against the private deposits would
come out, I suspect, lower by far than appears superficially from the
above table.

24. To complete the figures of Indian deposits,[120] it will be useful
to give at this point the deposits in the Post Office Savings Banks,
which have increased at a great rate, though not so fast as deposits in
Banks, since 1900:—

(a) Limit of annual cash deposits raised from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500.

(b) Estimate.

As in England, the Government do not maintain any specific reserve
against these deposits. They are treated as unfunded debt and used
for capital expenditure. It is important, therefore, to remember that
the Government now hold in India nearly £14,000,000 of unfunded debt
repayable at short notice to 1,500,000 depositors. This constitutes a
not negligible claim on their general reserves.

25. The figures of the preceding paragraphs, in their cumulative
effect, suggest the following reflection. Apart from any deterioration
in the proportion of reserves held, the question of Indian deposits
is now _important_. They stand for the first time at a figure which
is large in relation to the total trade of the country and to the
resources of the Government. If the Banks get into trouble, there
will be much more far–reaching effects than could have been the
case formerly. This is quite apart from the question whether they
are more _likely_ to get into trouble than formerly. The question
of the reserves they hold matters, therefore, more than it used.
The information which I have been able to convey in this chapter is
exceedingly incomplete. But, such as it is, it provides strong _prima
facie_ grounds for doubt and dissatisfaction.

26. The last group of Banks for discussion—since I have no precise
_data_ relating to the private and unincorporated bankers or
money–lenders—consists of those numerous institutions registered as
Banks under the Indian Companies Act, but with a capital insufficient
or with activities too mixed for inclusion in the list of Indian Joint
Stock Banks proper, dealt with above.

The available statistics (approximate) are as follows:—

  ┌──────────–┬─────────────────–┬──────────────────┐
  │ March 31. │ Number of Banks. │ Paid–up Capital. │
  ├──────────–┼─────────────────–┼──────────────────┤

  └──────────–┴─────────────────–┴──────────────────┘

There are no statistics of their deposits. While the capital of these
Banks has increased rather rapidly since 1907, the above figures show
that it is not yet large.

Our interest in these Banks, however, arises not so much out of the
banking business which they may possibly transact, as out of certain,
almost Gilbertian, characteristics calculated to bring the name and
profession of banking into derision or disrepute. These Banks have
discovered that there is, or may be, a useful ambiguity in the public
mind between nominal capital and paid–up capital, and that nothing
is cheaper than to increase the former. When, therefore, a Bank is
registered, its promoters may just as well put down as its nominal
capital sums ranging from £100,000 to £1,000,000 as anything else. One
comic opera Bank registered in Calcutta in 1910 put down £20,000,000,
without having at the time of the last return any paid–up capital at
all. Apart from this exceptional venture, the 38 Banks registered
in 1910–11 had between them a nominal capital of £1,306,000 and a
paid–up capital of £19,500. With enormous nominal capitals they
combine high–sounding titles—the Bank of Asia, the East India Bank,
the Hindustan Bank, the United Bank of Commerce, and so forth. Once
established, their activities are not limited. One of these Banks has
included in its operations coach–building and medical attendance.

27. Plainly these ventures are not to be taken too seriously. But the
recent activity of their promoters has raised some discussion in India
as to whether it would not be for the public good to restrain them by
legislation. In this matter, as is the case in so many (her governors
knowing no other model), the legislation of India has followed the
lines of Great Britain’s. Just as in this country there is no special
law relating to the incorporation of Banks, so in India Banks are
registered under the ordinary Joint Stock Companies Act. As a Bill
to amend this Act has been to the front for some time, discussion
has naturally centred round the question whether this opportunity
should not be taken of introducing some suitable restrictions relating
specifically to Banks.[121] While I am inclined to think that it would
be more convenient to deal with this matter in a separate Bill, the
important point is that decided action of some kind should be taken
with the least possible delay. The Upper Indian Chamber of Commerce, in
reply to an inquiry from Government in 1910, answered, very wisely, as
follows:—

 The Committee feel very strongly that something more is needed
 (_i.e._, than in other Companies) in the case of Banks where the
 capital and confidence, not only of the shareholders but of the
 depositors, are involved. New Banks are springing up with alarming
 rapidity, with little share capital subscribed; these Banks are
 trading on the confidence of the depositor who is little versed in
 money matters but is attracted by the name “Bank” and wishes to earn
 interest on his savings.... The fear is that if one of these mushroom
 growths fails, others will follow, and the timid depositor, unable to
 discriminate between the sound and the unsound concerns, will make
 haste to get his money back from whatever Bank it is in, and his
 confidence in banking institutions thus rudely checked will take
 years to win back.

Various suggestions have been made as to what restrictions would be
proper. It has been proposed that it should not be permitted to combine
banking operations with other businesses; that the accounts of Banks
should be regularly audited and the results published; that fairly
detailed accounts[122] should be published in the local official
Gazette; that all institutions calling themselves Banks should be
required to publish certain specified particulars at the head of every
advertisement; and that capital and reserves should bear a certain
proportion to liabilities before dividends may be paid. The abuse of a
great disproportion between nominal and paid–up capital could be cured
by a stamp duty on registration proportioned to the nominal capital.
Provisions for due publicity will probably lead in the long–run to the
best results—though care must be taken that the form for publication
of accounts is well suited to bring to the light what is most relevant.
Regulations of other kinds are apt to have hampering results which
cannot be easily foreseen. During the infancy of Indian banking,
nevertheless, it will very likely be wise to have some precise rule as
to the kind and amount of the reserves.

28. In conclusion, something must be said about proposals for a State
Bank. This is a proper subject for inquiry by a Royal Commission. I am
not prepared to discuss it here in detail.

The question is an old one. In 1836 “a large body of merchants
interested in the East Indies” submitted to the Court of Directors of
the East India Company a project for a “great Banking Establishment
for British India.” Such a Bank, “confining its transactions strictly
to Banking principles and business,” and “established by Act of
Parliament and possessed of adequate capital, would, under judicious
management and control, become an instrument of general good by
facilitating the employment of a portion of the redundant capital
of this country (England) for the general improvement of Indian
commerce, giving stability to the monetary system of India, and
preventing those occasional fluctuations to which it is at present
subject, and also by affording the Company facilities and advantages
in their future financial arrangements.” It was also to “facilitate
the receipt of the revenue and its subsequent diffusion through the
various channels of the public expenditure, furnish the remittance
to Great Britain of the sums required there for the Home Charges,
and enable the East India Company to act up to the instruction of
the legislature by keeping their Government entirely aloof from that
interference with the commerce of India which the present system of
remittance involves.... At present the basis of the Bank of Bengal
is too narrow for such a customer as the Government.” I quote this
from the _Account of the Presidency Banks_ by Mr. J. B. Brunyate, who
remarks on its appropriateness to present conditions. From 1860 to
1876 the possibility of the Bank of Bengal’s developing into a “Bank
of India” was constantly in the air, successive financial Members of
Council being not unfriendly to the idea. In 1867 a specific proposal
for the amalgamation of the three Presidency Banks was laid before the
Government of India in a memorandum of complete grasp and mastery by
Mr. Dickson, celebrated (in his own time) for pre–eminent ability as
Secretary and Treasurer of the Bank of Bengal. The Viceroy’s minute was
unfavourable. “I submit,” he wrote, “that it is not for the interest
of a State that a great institution of the kind should grow up for
all India, the interests of which may in time be opposed to those
of the public, and whose influence at any rate may overshadow that
of the Government itself. A Bank of such a character would be very
difficult to manage. Few men in India would be found equal to the
task. And as regards the interests and convenience of the merchants of
Bombay and Madras, surely it is only natural that they should prefer
separate Banks for those important centres of commerce.” The Secretary
of State’s sole contribution to the discussion—no need to name
him, it is the eternal Secretary of State speaking, not a transient
individual—was as follows:—

 Any proposition for changes of a fundamental character, such as
 the establishment of a Central State Bank, or a return to the
 system of Government Treasuries, which may hereafter be taken into
 consideration, must be viewed in its general bearings, and not with
 special reference to the circumstances, of a particular Presidency, or
 of a particular crisis.

The project was smothered in the magnificent and empty maxims of
political wisdom.[123]

Before the Fowler Committee of 1898, there was some desultory
discussion of proposals for a Central Bank of India, which were
supported by a few of the witnesses; but, apart from Mr. Hambro’s
memorandum, no attempt was made to deal with the question in
detail.[124]

29. At the present time the arguments in favour of a State Bank for
India are very strong,—far stronger than they were in 1867 or even
in 1898. The Government have taken over so many of the functions of a
Central Bank, that they cannot wisely neglect the rest. A note issue of
growing importance, the management of the Government’s cash balances,
the regulation of the foreign exchanges,—all these are controlled
together and treated as a whole in a compact and admirably conceived
scheme. But other benefits cannot be obtained easily, so long as
these functions are utterly divorced from those of banking proper. I
summarise the arguments thus:—

(i.) The existing divorce between responsibility for the note issue and
that for banking generally is contrary to modern banking practice, and
is, in several respects, a source of weakness.

(ii.) In particular it leads to the keeping of two distinct
reserves—the Government’s reserves and the bankers’ reserves—with
no clearly defined relation between them, so that the reserves of the
latter may be insufficient, without the assumption by the former of the
fact or the machinery of responsibility.

(iii.) It leads also to a want of elasticity in the system, since in
modern conditions this elasticity is most commonly provided by exactly
that co–operation between banking and note issue which is lacking in
India.

(iv.) The absence of a State Bank makes it difficult for the Government
to use its cash balances or any other part of its liquid funds to the
best advantage,—since it cannot prudently place the whole of its free
resources in the hands of a private institution.

(v.) The absence of a central banking authority leads to a general
lack of direction in the banking policy of the country: it is no one’s
business to look at the matter as a whole, to know the position of the
market’s component units, or to enforce prudence when it is needed.
There is a multiple reserve system in theory, but hardly an adequate
one in fact; and a danger exists that every one is reckoning, in a
crisis, upon every one else.

(vi.) The absence of the advice and experience, which the officers
of a State Bank would possess, is a source of weakness to Government
itself. There are no high officials whose business it is to make
finance the chief study of their life. The Financial Secretaryship is
an incident in the career of a successful civilian. A Financial Member
of Council is apt to come to the peculiar problems of his office with
a fresh mind. Thus the financial officers of Government spend five
years or so in mastering a difficult subject and have then reached
a seniority which warrants promotion to duties of some other kind.
So far as the Government of India is concerned, questions of finance
and currency are in the hands of intelligent amateurs who begin with
the timidity of ignorance and leave off just when they are becoming
properly secure of their ground. It is not astonishing that the centre
of power in these matters has tended to gravitate to the India Office
and the India Council in London. For the officials and advisers of
the Secretary of State have grown up in familiarity with the problems
of Indian currency. Control from the India Office is always looked
on, from an instinct often founded on wisdom, with jealousy and with
suspicion; but in questions of currency they are likely, as things now
are, to have the wider knowledge and experience. Yet the element of
continuity supplied by the India Office—though, as I read the history
of the last decade, it has been invaluable in guiding the evolution
of the currency—is no proper solution of the difficulty. With Indian
banking this authority cannot be adequately in touch, and it would be
much better if trained experience were to be found in India herself.
It is a remarkable thing that the two classical pronouncements on the
fundamental problems of Indian Finance, which have stood the test of
time—Mr. Dickson’s, in 1867, on the question of a Central Bank, and
Mr. A. M. Lindsay’s, in 1878 and subsequently, on the regulation of a
Gold Standard—should both have come from Secretaries of the Bank of
Bengal, not from high officials of State. (Yet this last argument for
a State Bank, though I have amplified it in my summary at greatest
length, is not at all the most important. The arguments given first are
those which govern the question.)

30. On the other hand, a fairly good case can be made out against a
State Bank. Several of the defects, outlined above, could be remedied,
in part at least, by less drastic proposals. The reasons on this side
are mainly, nevertheless, those of conservatism and of caution (or
timidity). The question, as soon as one attempts to frame practical
suggestions, bristles with difficulties. The Government are naturally
afraid of so troublesome a proposal—and one so far removed from
what they are used to; while there is no important body which is
sufficiently interested in forcing it on their attention. The Banks
fear a possible rival; merchants are content with present prosperity;
and no one else knows anything about it. I shall be astonished,
therefore, if action is taken while times are good. Perhaps we may have
to wait for the lessons of a severe crisis. Only under some such strong
influence as this is it likely that the responsible Government will
nerve itself to the task, or the business community acquiesce in it.

31. If some day sufficient constructive energy is stirred into activity
to undertake the task, let the framers of the new Bank’s constitution
put far from their minds all thoughts of the Bank of England. It is in
the State Banks of Europe, especially in that of Germany, or in those,
perhaps, of Holland or Russia, that the proper model is to be found.




CHAPTER VIII

THE INDIAN RATE OF DISCOUNT


1. The Presidency Banks publish an official minimum rate of discount,
in the same manner as the Bank of England. As an effective influence
on the Money Market the Presidency Bank Rates do not stand, and do
not pretend to stand, in a situation comparable in any respect with
the Bank of England’s. They do not attempt to control the market and
dictate what the rate ought to be. They, rather, follow the market and
supply an index of the general position.

It is, therefore, as the best available index to variations in the
value of money in India that the Presidency Bank Rates are chiefly
interesting; and it is in this capacity that I shall make use of them
in this chapter.

[Illustration:

  _H. Bellingham_,

]

If we are to use these rates, however, as an index, a few warnings are
first necessary. There is, of course, in India, just as there is in
England, not one single rate for money, but several rates according the
period of the loan required (or the maturity the bill negotiated) and
the character of the security offered. The published Bank Rate in India
represents, I believe, the rate charged day by day for a loan advanced
on such security as Government Paper. The interest on a loan of this
kind, that is to say, is calculated day by day at the published Bank
Rate prevailing on each day. It may be said to correspond, therefore,
to the London rate for some comparatively short period—say for
fortnightly loans. Because the Bank Rate is at 7 per cent, it does not
follow, therefore, that money can be used, or obtained, at this rate
for two or three months. The rate ordinarily charged for fine bills
of two or three months’ currency may be either higher or lower than
the published minimum Bank Rate. Further, the rates published by the
Presidency Banks may be from time to time more or less “effective.” The
Banks may not always be able, that is to say, to do any considerable
volume of business at their published minima. This would not be the
case, I believe, in the busy season, so much as in the slack season,
when the Banks do not let their published rates fall below 3 per cent,
although money may be practically unusable and they would probably
be glad enough to lend a large sum at 2 per cent. But these various
qualifications do not prevent the Presidency Bank Rates from affording
the best available index for measuring the relative ease or stringency
of the Indian Money Market. I append a chart giving the movements of
the Rate of Discount at the Presidency Bank of Bengal since 1893.[125]

2. The rates, announced by the three Presidency Banks, are not always
identical, but seldom, if ever, differ by more than 1 per cent. Such
differences as there are chiefly reflect the differences in date at
which occur the various crop movements with which each Presidency is
mainly concerned. A wider difference of rate tends to be prevented,
not only by the possibility of moving funds from one part of India to
another, but also by the fact that the Secretary of State is willing to
make his Bills and Transfers payable at any of the Presidency towns at
the option of the purchaser. If there is relatively greater stringency
at one of them, the bulk of the Council Bills and Transfers sold in
London tend to be drawn on that one. The general appearance of the
chart would not, therefore, have been appreciably different if I had
chosen Bombay in place of Bengal.

The official rates move by 1 per cent at a time. There have been
occasions of movements by 2 per cent, but not recently. When the rate
is rising or falling, however, at the beginning or end of the busy
season, changes often follow one another in quick succession.

3. An examination of the chart shows that the Indian Money Market
enjoys years of high and low average rates respectively, just as other
markets do. But these annual variations, while perfectly noticeable,
are relatively small in comparison with the seasonal changes, which are
very great and very regular, and which afford the most clear ground of
differentiation between the Indian Market and those with which we are
familiar in Europe.

Let us examine the annual fluctuations of the rate in recent years in
more detail:—

  └────┴────────────┴────────────┴────┴────────────┴────────────┘

From this table and the chart it is safe to make the generalisation
that the Indian Rate may be expected to reach 8 per cent in the winter
or early spring, and to fall to 3 per cent in summer. Years differ
from one another chiefly in the length of time for which the high and
low rates prevail respectively. From 8 to 3 per cent is an enormous
range for the normal seasonal fluctuation. What is the explanation of
it? The Bank of England rate seldom exceeds 5 per cent, and in many
years falls short of this, even in the winter. If there is so regular
an expectation of obtaining 7 or 8 per cent in India on excellent
security, why is it not worth some one’s while to transfer funds
to India in the busy season on an ampler scale than is the case at
present, and thus secure the advantage of so wide a discrepancy between
the English and the Indian rates?

4. The facts are to be explained, I think, as follows. High rates of 7
or 8 per cent are not obtainable in India all the year round. In normal
years they cannot be relied on to prevail for more than about three
months. The banker who raises funds in London in order to lend them
for short periods in India has to choose between leaving them in India
all the year round, waiting after one busy season for the next, and
bringing them back again to London after a comparatively short period.
He must either accept, that is to say, the rate obtainable in India
on the average of the whole year, or he must earn a high enough rate
in the brief busy season to compensate him for bearing the expense of
remittance _both ways_.

In considering the difference between two European Bank Rates as the
cause of a transfer of funds between the two centres, the cost of
remittance, as measured by the difference between the telegraphic
rate of exchange outwards at the beginning of the transaction and the
telegraphic rate of exchange back at the end of it, is not, of course,
to be neglected. But where the two centres are near together and there
is no reason to anticipate the suspension of a free market in gold,
this cost is, relatively, a minor consideration. The great distance,
however, between London and India makes it in their case a very
significant quantity, and a brief calculation shows that, measured in
terms of Bank Rate, the cost of remittance works out higher, perhaps,
than uninstructed common sense would anticipate. For, under present
conditions, the cost of remittance both ways can hardly be less than
1/16d. per rupee, rising in most years as between certain dates as high
as 5/32d., and reaching occasionally as much as 3/16d. It would not be
prudent to act on the expectation of a less cost than 3/32d. Now 3/32d.
on a rupee is about ·6 per cent. If this loss on exchange (_i.e._ on
remittance) is to be recouped in three months (_i.e._ in a quarter of
a year), an additional rate of nearly 2½ per cent per annum must be
earned in India as compared with the rate in London. If a different
degree of loss in exchange is anticipated, and if the length of time
for which money can be used in India at a high rate is expected to
be more or less than three months, the calculation must be adjusted
accordingly. In any case the reason why the Indian and London Bank
Rates can differ from one another for short periods by large amounts
is adequately explained. If, for example, money can be employed in
India at the high rate for one month only, even if the double cost of
remittance for that period is so low as 1/16d., the difference between
the London and Indian rates must amount to 5 per cent per annum to make
a transfer of funds _prima facie_ profitable.

These illustrations show that what seems a very small fluctuation
in exchange can account for a very wide difference in the rate of
discount; and, apart from questions of unequal knowledge and unequal
security, it is this possibility of fluctuation that makes distinct
markets of the two centres. The underlying explanation is essentially
the same as that of the circumstance to which I called attention in
§ 9 of Chapter II., namely, that a temporary premium of ¾ per cent
on gold in those European countries where gold is not always freely
obtainable, is as effective as a very great increase in the Bank Rate
in preventing the remittance of funds abroad and even in attracting an
inward flow of funds.

5. This discussion will have served to make clear a distinction highly
important to the problem of the Indian Bank Rate. When we say that the
Indian Bank Rate is apt to be high, we mean, not that the _average_
effective rate over the whole year is high, but that the _maximum_ rate
in each year, effective for periods of shorter or longer duration, is
generally high. A high average rate and a high maximum rate are likely
to call for different explanations and, if a remedy is sought, for
different kinds of remedies. The available evidence does not suggest
that the average rate in India is at all unduly high for a country
in India’s stage of economic and financial development. Some of the
Exchange Banks, for example, do not find it worth their while to offer
more than 3½ per cent on Indian deposits fixed for a year. It is the
high maximum rate almost invariably reached which calls for enquiry.

The phenomenon under discussion is in no way peculiar to India and
does not arise out of those features of the Indian system which are
characteristic of a Gold–Exchange Standard. We find the same thing in
any country where the demand for funds for financing trade is to a
high degree seasonal and variable in amount throughout the year, and
where, at the same time, these funds have to be remitted from some
far distant foreign centre—in the countries of South America, for
example. In fact, by the establishment of a par of exchange between
the rupee and sterling; the severity of seasonal stringency has been
greatly moderated. The exceptionally high Bank Rates of 1897 and
1898 were partly occasioned by a natural timidity on the part of the
Banks in importing funds at a rate of exchange which at that time was
exceptionally high. The Banks had no guarantee that exchange would
be maintained at or near the existing level, and if they imported
funds they ran the risk of having to bring them home again at a heavy
loss. Under present arrangements the maximum fluctuation in exchange
between the busy season and the slack is known and limited. But while
the stabilisation of the gold value of the rupee has done much for
the Indian Money Market, and has rendered a 12 per cent Bank Rate
most improbable except at a time of wide–spread crisis and panic, it
does not prevent an 8 per cent or even a 9 per cent Bank Rate from
being a comparatively common occurrence. Is it possible to conceive of
any remedy or moderating influence for the somewhat severe seasonal
stringency still experienced?

6. It is clear that a remedy can be sought in one or other of two
ways only. Either the cost of remittance and the maximum range of
fluctuation in exchange must be reduced, or a new source for the
seasonal supply of funds must be found in India herself. I will discuss
these alternatives in turn.

It will help to make the points at issue plain if I begin by taking an
extreme case. Let us suppose that exchange between London and Calcutta
were fixed at 1s. 4d., in the sense that the Government were always
prepared to provide telegraphic remittance _in either direction_ at
this rate. Under such circumstances, the London and Indian Money
Markets would become practically one market, and the large differences
which can now exist between rates current in the two centres for loans
on similar security would become impossible. The effect of this on
the volume of remittance would be very great. Every year immense sums
would be remitted from London to India in the busy season and brought
back again at the end of it, since the fact which now diminishes the
profitableness of such transactions would have ceased to exist. The
following illustration shows on how large a scale these seasonal
movements to and fro would probably be. In July the cash reserves of
the Bank of Bengal might stand, as things now are, at, let us suppose,
about 1000 lakhs and its discount rate at 3 per cent. This reserve
might be 400 or 500 lakhs at least in excess of what prudence required.
But it would be useless to lower the Bank Rate; for the additional
funds were probably not loanable in India for the month of July at
any rate at all. Yet for the reasons already given it would not be
worth while in existing circumstances for any one to borrow this sum
and remit it to London, until such time as it may be again wanted in
Calcutta;—it is better to let it lie idle and wait for busier times.
But fix exchange at 1s. 4d. and all this would be changed. The Bank’s
customers would immediately remit the 400 or 500 lakhs to London,
knowing that they could be brought back without loss as soon as they
were wanted. Every one in India having loanable funds to spare would
act likewise.

What would be the effect on the Secretary of State if he were to lay
himself under such an obligation? In order to be in a position to act
as universal money–changer, and to be able to provide large quantities
of sterling in London in the slack season, and large quantities of
rupee funds in India in the busy season, it would be necessary for
him to keep very much larger reserves than he does at present in
both countries. It might even be necessary for him to remit gold
backwards and forwards himself, thus bearing the whole expense of
which the Exchange Banks were being relieved. At present the possible
fluctuation of exchange between what may fairly be termed the “gold
points” on either side of 1s. 4d., acts in some measure as a protection
to the currency and lessens the reserves which it is necessary for
the authorities to maintain; a falling exchange acts as a drag on
remittance from India and a rising exchange as a drag on remittance
from London, thus bringing the private interests of individuals and
the natural forces acting on the market into greater harmony with
the interests of the market as a whole, and with the efforts of
the Secretary of State to maintain the stability of the system. If
telegraphic exchange were fixed at 1s. 4d., the Indian Bank Rate would
closely follow London’s, but it would be at the expense of forcing the
Secretary of State enormously to increase his reserves.

7. I have taken this extreme case in order to make emphatic the
principles involved in all such proposals. But no one is likely to
propose the above as a practical policy. More moderate proposals of the
same kind, however, deserve consideration. Some critics, for example,
have suggested that the Secretary of State should never sell Council
Bills in London below 1s. 4d. This would lessen to a certain extent
the probable range of fluctuation in exchange and might, therefore,
diminish the risk of loss involved in remitting to India when exchange
is high; but the Secretary of State’s withdrawal from the market would
not necessarily prevent exchange from falling below 1s. 4d. Moreover,
in normal times the policy actually followed already approximates
closely to this proposal; in the last three years the occasions on
which Council Bills have been sold below 1s. 4d. have been very rare.
And in exceptional times it may be some protection to the sterling
reserves if Council Bills can be sold at a lower rate if necessary. I
conclude, therefore, that the advantage of such a policy would not be
great, probably not great enough to outweigh the cost.

Thus it is not easy to find a remedy for high Bank Rate by any method
of diminishing the maximum range of fluctuation in exchange. Indeed
so long as the currency arrangements are at all like those now in
force, this maximum range may fairly be said to be determined by forces
outside Government control, namely, by the forces governing the cost of
remittance of gold. Though the burden of this cost may be shifted, it
cannot be easily avoided altogether.

8. We must fall back, therefore, on the second alternative, the
discovery of a new source for the seasonal supply of funds in India
herself. A proposal, having this object in view, has already been put
forward in more than one passage in the preceding pages. I believe
that, in future, the Government of India may have in the busy season
a considerable stock of rupee funds available in the Paper Currency
Reserve and, occasionally, a surplus stock in the Indian Cash Balances.
If a proper machinery is set up for lending these out in India, I
anticipate some appreciable relief to the Bank Rate at the season of
greatest stringency. Assuming that such a policy is practicable on
other grounds, let us try to compare its precise effect as compared
with the existing state of affairs.

9. Broadly speaking, surplus Government funds in India can at present
be released only by the sale of Council Bills in London. When these
bills are sold at a fairly high rate, the Government gain the premium
over and above 1s. 4d. and are in a position to put out at interest
funds in London. If the funds in India, instead of being released
through the encashment of Council Bills, are lent out there direct, the
interest obtained in India takes the place of the two sources of gain
distinguished above. In the first case money is first borrowed from
the London Money Market (by the Exchange Banks or otherwise) for the
purchase of Council Bills, and is then lent back again to that Market
by the Secretary of State. In the second case, instead of a double
transaction in London there is a single transaction in India. It might
be argued that the two methods come in the end to much the same thing;
that there can be no relief to the Money Market unless the Government
of India accept a lower rate of interest for sums lent out in India
than is the equivalent of what they would make if they were to sell
Council Bills at a premium and lend out the funds in England; and that
the second method involves no net addition to the resources available
in India. For the following reasons, however, I do not think that this
way of looking at the matter would be correct.

In the first place there would be an elimination of risk. If the
average loss from exchange on funds sent out to India for the busy
season works out at (say) 2 per cent per annum, the Banks, in order to
recompense themselves for the risk of fluctuations beyond the average,
would be able to make a difference of more than 2 per cent between
the current Indian and English rates. In the case of funds borrowed
in terms of rupees and repayable in terms of rupees, this element of
risk is absent; and the elimination of it provides a source of net
gain. If the effect of Government lending in India were to mitigate the
seasonal stringency there, some lowering of the normal upper limit of
fluctuation of exchange might result. In so far as this was the case,
in normal years the consequences would be outwardly similar to those
of the first alternative, discussed and rejected above, whilst the
Government would not have bound themselves by any undertaking capable
of turning out burdensome.

Secondly, the rate of interest which the Secretary of State can earn on
loans in London is appreciably lower, on account of the short period
for which he lends and the nature of the security he requires, than
the normal rate at which the Exchange Banks would raise their funds
there, and a good deal lower than what would be obtained by direct
lending in India. (It should be admitted, on the other hand, that
the practice of lending funds in India would probably involve some
sacrifice of perfect safety as compared with the present arrangements.)

And, thirdly, it is not clear that it might not sometimes be feasible
to lend out in India sums additional to those which would in fact be
released under the present system, so that there would be some net
addition to the resources available in India.

10. In addition, therefore, to the grounds for making loans in India
from the Paper Currency Reserve which I have given in earlier chapters,
I believe that it is in this direction that the best hope lies of a
remedy for the high level which the Indian Bank Rate commonly reaches
in the course of each busy season. I do not feel in a position to say
anything very decided as to the manner in which such loans could be
best made. But there is a presumption, I think, that, in the absence
of a State Bank, they must be made, mainly if not entirely, through
the Presidency Banks. And I believe that the Government would act
advisedly if, as a general rule, 5 or 5½ per cent were the highest
rate they ever chose to exact from the Banks. In financial matters of
this kind there is a danger lest Governments prove too jealous of the
profits of private persons. In a case where the co–operation of private
persons is necessary, they must be allowed a reasonable share of the
profits of the transaction. In their past relations with the Presidency
Banks in the matter of temporary loans, the Government of India have
sometimes seemed to attach more importance to preventing the Banks
from making any profit out of the loans than to any other aspect of
the transaction. I may repeat that the loans I contemplate are to be
for the busy season only, and that they should not be made until the
expectation of a normal or successful harvest is reasonably assured.

11. In the nature of a postscript to the above proposals, it may be
instructive to consider them in the light of the actual circumstances
of the season 1912–13. The peculiarity of this season from the point
of view of the Indian Money Market was the combination of a high Bank
Rate in India for a comparatively long period[126] with a relatively
low rate of exchange and only a moderate demand for Council Bills and
gold. At the end of 1912 the situation could have been described as
normal. The Bank Rate was at the somewhat high level usual at that
time of year; exchange was high (the minimum rate for the allotment of
Council Bills being 1s. 4–3/32d.); and the demand for Council Bills was
on a large scale. But from January to March, although the Bank Rate
remained at a high level and trade was active, the demand for Council
Bills fell away, slowly at first and rapidly during March, exchange
dropping _pari passu_ until, during the latter half of March, the
minimum rate at which Council Bills were allotted fell so low as 1s.
3–31/32d. The combination of so low a rate of exchange with an 8 per
cent Bank Rate at Bombay was very abnormal.

It is dangerous for a writer who is not in touch with the practical
side of the Money Market to venture on an explanation of current
events. But I will give my explanation for what it is worth. The poor
demand for Council Bills in March 1913 is not to be explained by the
competition of gold as a means of remittance; for the low level of
exchange did not favour the importation of sovereigns (even from Egypt,
except earlier in the season), and as a matter of fact the import of
them was on a very much smaller scale than in the previous year. It
must have been due, therefore, to an unwillingness on the part of the
Exchange Banks and others to lay out money in London for the purchase
of remittance to India. This unwillingness was due to a variety of
causes. The lock–up of funds in silver and opium, and the freedom with
which India was purchasing foreign goods, probably had something to do
with it; and an important contributory influence was the dearness[127]
of money in London combined with a sufficient expectation of cheaper
money soon, to provide an incentive to delay, wherever delay was
possible. A precise diagnosis of the causes of the unwillingness on
the part of the Banks to buy Council Bills is not necessary, however,
to the lesson I seek to enforce. For whatever reason, Indian Bank
Rates of 7 and 8 per cent, even in combination with a very low level
of exchange, did not in fact tempt the Banks to buy Council Bills on
any considerable scale. What was the effect on the Government Balances
in India? The ordinary method, by which the rupees accumulating in
the Reserve Treasuries from the proceeds of taxation are quickly
released and given back to the Money Market, the encashment, namely,
of large volumes of Council Bills, had failed. The position was
aggravated by the large realised surplus, much of which was to be
devoted to expenditure only in the _next_ financial year, and which in
the meantime was swelling the Government Balances in any case beyond
their usual dimensions. So far, therefore, from assisting the market,
the Government were busy increasing the stringency by taking off the
market, week by week, rupees which for the moment they did not in the
least want. Already at the end of 1912 (see table on p. 188) the sums
lying idle in the Reserve Treasuries were unusually high. By the end
of February 1913, the total Government Balances in India had risen to
£17,400,000, and the end of March to £19,300,000, of which £8,000,000
lay in the Reserve Treasuries. What Money Market in the world could
have seen such sums taken out of its use and control at one of the
busiest moments of the year without suffering a loss of ease?

The situation was not due, in my judgment, to any ignorance or
incompetence on the part of the executive officers of Government, but
to a system which provided them with no sort of appropriate machinery
for dealing with the position. The “Independent Treasury System” and
the traditional aloofness of Government from the Money Market were seen
at their worst. Millions of rupees were lying idle in the Government
Treasuries at the time of year when there was most work for them to do
outside. The sort of arrangements I have outlined in earlier paragraphs
might have done something, I feel sure, to ease the situation. One can
point, therefore, to the first quarter of 1913 as a specific occasion
on which Government could have lent sums in India with profit to
itself, with advantage to the Money Market, and without incurring any
risk of which it need have been afraid.

12. I have now completed my discussion of these questions. Two points
I would end by emphasising. The first affects my general treatment of
the subject matter. I have tried to bring out the fact that the Indian
system is an exceedingly _coherent_ one. Every part of the system
fits into some other part. It is impossible to say everything at once,
and an author must needs sacrifice from time to time the complexity
and interdependence of fact in the interests of the clearness of his
exposition. But the complexity and the coherence of the system require
the constant attention of anyone who would criticise the parts. This is
not a peculiarity of Indian Finance. It is the characteristic of all
monetary problems. The difficulty of the subject is due to it.

My second point affects the kinship of Indian arrangements to those
lately developed in other parts of the world. Indian affairs are
so exclusively studied by those whose knowledge and experience is
preponderantly Indian or English, that the true perspective of India’s
development is sometimes lost; and the value of foreign experiences
neglected. I urge that, in her Gold–Exchange Standard, and in the
mechanism by which this is supported, India, so far from being
anomalous, is in the forefront of monetary progress. But in her banking
arrangements, in the management of her note issue, and in the relations
of her Government to the Money Market, her position _is_ anomalous; and
she has much to learn from what is done elsewhere.

                              FOOTNOTES:


[1] Mr. Brunyate spoke as follows:—“Many here will remember the
arguments used on behalf of the tea–planting industry. At that time
India and China had been competing together for years on the same
footing as regards currency. It was argued that the disturbance of
the exchange, the appreciation of the rupee and the depreciation of
silver, might not only result in India’s ascendancy in regard to tea
being wrested from her, but in the entire and irretrievable ruin of the
tea industry. I am quoting the words actually used by the Darjeeling
Planters’ Association in 1892. In the year before the closing of the
Mints India exported 115 million pounds of tea to foreign countries,
and by 1909 had a little more than doubled that amount. Almost exactly
the same arguments were used in regard to the cotton industry, and here
I must enter into more detail. What the mill–owners feared, and had
excellent reason for fearing, was an enormous depreciation in silver.
This actually took place. In 1892–93, the year before the Mints were
closed, the average value of silver per ounce was nearly 40d. The next
year it fell to 33⅓d.; the year after to about 29d.; and it stayed at
or below 30d. for some years. Surely here were the conditions in which
a disastrous stimulus to production in China might have been expected.
The so–called bounty in this case was not 2 per cent but 25 per cent.
It was not a temporary decline which might be counterbalanced by other
causes in the course of a single month. It continued for years, and as
we all know silver has not since returned to a price anything like 40d.
an ounce. In addition, just before the closing of the Mints occurred
there had been considerable overtrading, and the mills had actually
been working short time for some months before to enable the Chinese
markets to dispose of their accumulated stocks. There was, as a matter
of fact, a fall in exports in 1893–94 partly due to the dislocation
arising from the changes in our currency system and partly to the
existing glut of the Chinese market. The exports picked up, however,
in 1894–95, and it would appear that the adjustment of prices and
wages in China to the extraordinary new conditions began very quickly,
for I find it stated that by the first month of 1894 the mills were
again working steadily and profitably. I may perhaps give the actual
figures. In 1891–92 the exports of yarn had been 161 million pounds.
In 1892–93 the inflated year just preceding the closing of the Mints,
they rose to 189 million pounds. In 1893–94 they fell (as I have said)
to 134 millions, but went up again the following year to 159 millions.
In 1902–3 and 1903–4, though by this time the value of silver had now
fallen to 24d., the exports were about 250,000,000 pounds, and in
1905–6 they reached the record figure of 298 millions. In the last two
or three years there has been a falling off, owing to various causes,
but the amount exported in 1908–9 was as much as 235 millions, and in
the exports to China in particular there was a marked improvement.”

[2] There had been temporary Acts to the same effect in 1898 and 1900.

[3] Notes of Rs. 100 were universalised in 1911 by Notification under
this Act.

[4] The Hon. Mr. Dadabhoy, speaking in the Legislative Council in 1910,
argued that “the harmful effects of a further fall in silver (_i.e._
in its bullion value) can be neutralised by Government by creating a
further contraction in the volume of the currency, and thus producing
a greater scarcity of the rupee, by maintaining the Gold Standard
Reserve at a higher figure, and, further, by more frequent withdrawal
of Council Bills from the market.” A contraction of the currency would
not, of course, have the effect supposed, but the Government could not,
in fact, bring about a contraction in the manner described.

[5] This question of the power of Government over the volume of
circulation is discussed in much greater detail in § 8 of Chapter V.

[6] For example, in November 1912, “no gold was handed across the
counter at the Bank of France except on the most urgent demand, and
then the highest sum paid in gold was 300 francs per head. The other
banks followed this example, and the most generous released 200 francs
in gold. All special wishes for payment in money were charged 1 per
cent premium. At the same time, deposits in gold were credited with 1
per cent premium” (see _Bankers’ Magazine_, December 1912, p. 794).
At the beginning of the month cashiers were charging a premium or
commission of 6 f. per 1000 f. for payments in gold instead of silver
(see _Economist_, November 9, 1912, p. 961).

[7] Although the Bank of France only holds an important quantity of
foreign bills (generally sterling), on exceptional occasions, _e.g._
at the beginning and end of 1907 and at the end of 1909, foreign paper
enters very largely, through the agency of the great Crédit Banks, into
the transactions of the French Money Market. These institutions take
foreign bills into their own portfolios, and obtain the necessary funds
by rediscounting inland bills at the Bank of France. Thus the French
mechanism is much more closely analogous to the British than appears
outwardly, and the influence of the Bank of France, like that of the
Bank of England, is mainly indirect. The possibility of this is no
doubt due to the fact that France, like Great Britain, is a creditor
nation in the international short–loan market.

[8] For example, in November 1912 there was a premium of nearly ¾ per
cent on gold for export.

[9] This premium was made possible by the Austro–Hungarian Bank’s
exercising its right to refuse to exchange its bank notes for gold
freely.

[10] In the abnormal conditions of recent times (1912–13), however, the
Bank has not found it possible to maintain this part of its reserves at
a high level.

[11] This does not include the funds held abroad on account of the
Russian Treasury. Speaking in March 1913, in the Budget Committee of
the Duma, the Minister of Finance stated that the total amount of
Russian State funds placed abroad was £60,000,000.

[12] I have throughout deliberately ignored the current practice
of the United States in these matters. Her development and present
position are anomalous, and have claimed no imitators. Her arrangements
would need a discussion to themselves, and would, I think, convey few
lessons of value to students of Indian affairs. In dealing with her
dependencies, she has herself imitated, almost slavishly, India.

[13] I may seem to speak as if Japan had in name a Gold–Exchange
Standard, which is not the case. There is not much publicity in regard
to her monetary arrangements. But I believe that they are, in fact,
such that it is as a Gold–Exchange Standard hers ought impartially to
be classified. The Finance Minister stated in the Diet in 1912 that
the gold funds held by the Government and the Bank of Japan in Europe
and the United States were about £37,000,000. The amount of gold
circulating in Japan herself is, I believe, inconsiderable.

[14] Unless it be Egypt.

[15] In the course of the last twenty years, however, the Bank of
Holland, having got rid of the greater part of her redundant stock of
silver coins, has gradually come to rely more on her holding of gold
and less on her holding of foreign bills than formerly. In 1892–93
foreign bills at £1,801,409 were about 16 per cent of her resources
(excluding silver coin); in 1911–12 they had fallen to £1,389,139
or about 5·5 per cent of her resources (excluding silver coin). But
the media of exchange are still notes and silver, and not less than
formerly does the Bank pursue the policy of keeping her gold for
purposes of export only and of withholding it from circulation. Almost
the whole of her stock of gold is in the form of bars and foreign
coin. (It should be added, however, that at the end of 1912 there
were proposals, in order to avoid fresh coinage of silver, for the
introduction of a 5 fl. gold piece.)

[16] The rupee contains ⅜ oz. of silver of eleven–twelfths fineness.
When standard silver is at 24d. per oz. the cost of a rupee to the
Government is about 9·181d.; at 32d. per oz. it is about 12·241d. The
average rate of profit on coinage of rupees from 1910 to May 1912 was
about 42% of the nominal value.

[17] See also pp. 199, 200.

[18] For this and other historical details see J. B. Brunyate, _An
Account of the Presidency Banks_.

[19] Mr. Wilson had proposed to invest a high proportion of the reserve
(perhaps two–thirds) in Government securities.

[20] I quote this from the Secretary of State’s despatch (Sir Charles
Wood, March 26, 1860) criticising Mr. Wilson’s original scheme.

[21] A rearrangement was made in 1910; previous to that date there
were four circles and four sub–circles. It is no longer worth while
to explain the relations which used to exist between the circles and
sub–circles.

[22] For the legal provisions outlined in the following paragraphs see
_Statistics of British India_, part iv. (a).

[23] For some further details see p. 9.

[24] Report of Comptroller of Paper Currency, 1910.

[25] Before 1893 these terms were used with a different significance.
The statistics are still a little ambiguous as to whether for the net
circulation the notes in Government reserve treasuries or the notes in
_all_ Government treasuries are to be deducted. I use the term in the
latter sense.

[26] For an account of this see p. 73.

[27] At all times the vast bulk of the funds held by the Presidency
Banks at their Head Offices are kept in notes, chiefly of high
denominations (Rs. 1000 and Rs. 10,000); _e.g._ on December 31, 1911,
£4,200,000 out of £4,800,000 was thus held.

[28] The part played by gold is discussed in Chapter IV.

[29] I estimate that at this date the total volume of the active rupee
circulation was between five and six times the total volume of the
active note circulation.

[30] The proper proportion would partly depend upon the policy pursued
in regard to the Gold Standard Reserve.

[31] H. of C. 495 of 1913.

[32] This quotation is from a letter addressed by the Government of
India to the Secretary of State, nine years later (May 16, 1912).

[33] The value of the token coins (silver, nickel, and bronze)
circulating in Egypt and the Sudan is estimated at no more than
£E3,600,000, and the notes of the National Bank of Egypt (chiefly
current in the large towns) at £E2,400,000. The whole of the rest of
the currency consists of gold coins (chiefly British sovereigns). The
existing position in Egypt is, therefore, the ideal at which many
Indian currency reformers seem to aim.

[34] See Lindsay’s evidence before Indian Currency Committee (1898), Q.
3404.

[35] The above account is summarised from the Reports of the
Comptroller of Paper Currency for 1900 and 1901.

[36] This is probably very considerable. India must be the main source
of supply of gold for the whole of Central Asia. The following extract
from a report sent in to the Comptroller of Currency (1911–12) is
instructive:—“From Peshawar a considerable absorption of gold in
connection with the trans–border trade is reported; this trade is said
to have amounted during 1911–12 to the value of Rs. 30 lakhs. Gold so
taken seldom or never returns. The Amir’s subsidy is also largely paid
in gold.” It is also reported that gold is preferred by those who go on
pilgrimage to Mecca.

[37] Throughout 1911–12 the Bank of Bengal quoted them at a premium of
4d.

[38] Report on Paper Currency, 1911–12.

[39] See pp. 97–99.

[40] See Report for 1909.

[41] In the _calendar_ year 1912 India increased her stock of gold by
£29,500,000, of which about £21,500,000 was in sovereigns.

[42] The fluctuations in the proportions for different years of the
figures in columns (4) and (5) of the table on p. 76 must certainly be
explained in part by the state of the exchanges, and not wholly by the
degree of deliberate preference for sovereigns.

[43] The Accountant–General, Bombay, has suggested (_see_ Paper
Currency Report, 1911–1912) that “the principal cause” of the heavy
importation of sovereigns has been a reduction in the rate of charge
(from 1/16 per cent to 1/32 per cent) for Telegraphic Transfers issued
upon Madras and Calcutta against gold imported into Bombay. No doubt,
this favours gold to a slightly greater extent than before, as against
Council Transfers, as a means of remittance from London to Madras and
Calcutta, but the difference seems too small in relation to the other
factors which determine the cheapest form of remittance, for the change
to have exerted any appreciable influence.

[44] This corresponds to the Bank of England’s normal price for gold
bullion.

[45] At present notes can be issued by currency offices, but only to
treasuries on the requisition of the Comptroller–General, in exchange
for gold bullion at the rate of 1 rupee for 7·53344 grains troy of fine
gold. Since April 1, 1907, the receipt at the Indian Mints of gold
bullion and gold coins other than sovereigns and half–sovereigns has,
in fact, been stopped by Government of India Notification.

[46] I have, however, seen no evidence which suggests that
_half_–sovereigns are specially popular on account of their lower
denomination.

[47] The Manager of the National Bank in the Punjab reported in
1911–1912:—“The fact of currency notes having always been unpopular
throughout the Punjab and, excepting in Lahore, being cashed only at
a considerable discount, has no doubt conduced to the popularity of
the sovereign. A portable medium commanding its full face value was
urgently required and the sovereign has for the present met the want.”

[48] £6000 in rupees weighs more than a ton.

[49] The Government should probably instruct its officers to receive
and change notes with freedom on every possible occasion, in order to
dissipate this idea.

[50] See pp. 113–118 for an account of the cost of transporting bullion
to India.

[51] It was operative, however, in the middle of March 1913, when the
whole amount offered was not allotted, tenders below 1s. 4d. being
rejected; later in the month tenders below 1s. 4d. were accepted.

[52] The rule is supposed to be that the extra charge for transfers is
1–32d. per rupee when the Indian bank rate is below 9 per cent, and
1/16d. when it is 9 per cent or above. The last occasions, on which the
difference of 1/16d. was in force, occurred between December 1906 and
March 1907. In 1904 and formerly the 1/16d. difference came into force
when the Indian bank rate exceeded 6 per cent.

[53] Thus a probable effect of exceptionally large sales of Council
Bills is an earmarking of gold on Indian account at the Bank of
England. The extent to which the Indian system can be misunderstood is
well illustrated by the fact that in a money article recently published
in an important newspaper in this country, an increased offering of
bills by the India Council was given as a reason for expecting a
_postponement_ of the need for earmarking gold at the Bank on Indian
account.

[54] On two occasions this practice has been suspended—in January
1900, when the price rose to 1s. 4⅜d., and in December 1906–March
1907, when it rose to 1s. 4–3/16d. The reason for the suspension in
the second case was the operation of the rule by which the premium
charged for telegraphic transfers over the rate for bills depends on
the Indian bank rate (see p. 105). The statement made in answer to a
question on this subject in the House of Commons (April 30, 1912) by
the Parliamentary Under–Secretary was not quite correct.

[55] Old–fashioned treatises on the foreign exchanges often leave the
student with the impression that the gold import point is a known and
stable thing given for good in books of reference. How far this is from
the truth, the example of India well illustrates.

[56] It is worth his while to do this, because the cost of sending gold
from Australia to London in one transaction is less than the cost of
sending it first from Australia to India and then from India to London
in two separate transactions.

[57] I make this assumption, which is not exactly accurate, for
purposes of illustration only.

[58] Or less, if paid at the time of shipment and in advance of the
time of delivery.

[59] See p. 37 (footnote).

[60] The designation of the reserve was changed from “Gold Reserve” to
“Gold Standard Reserve” in 1906, when it was decided to hold a part in
silver; but the change of title has not really made the position much
clearer.

[61] At the end of March 1913, £1,620,000 in gold stood to the credit
of the Gold Standard Reserve in London.

[62] See also pp. 190, 191, below.

[63] Reckoning uncoined silver at its coined value.

[64] A further loan of £2,500,000 for “general purposes” was incurred
in December 1908.

[65] An unfunded debt of £6,000,000, which has been wiped off lately
out of the proceeds of the opium windfall, was incurred by the issue of
India Bills during this period.

[66] For details of the method applied in these various investigations
see Appendices to Reports of Head Commissioner of Paper Currency, 1894,
1895, 1896, 1897, and 1900. See also Mr. Harrison’s article on the
“Rupee Census” in the _Economic Journal_ for 1891.

[67] _Stat. Journ._ March 1897 and March 1903.

[68] This represents a _per capita_ circulation of between Rs. 7 and
Rs. 8.

[69] In 1899, the Government of India contemplated the possibility
of a loan. See their despatch of August 24, 1899 (H. of C. 495 of
1913, p. 13):—“If India were afflicted with famine or other adverse
circumstances in the earlier years of our new currency, and before an
adequate reserve had accumulated, circumstances might arise in which
borrowing to maintain the standard would become an absolute necessity.
We should have preferred to have been armed against such a contingency
... not by actual borrowing but by obtaining power to borrow.... We
have learnt with satisfaction ... that your lordship has stated in the
House of Commons that borrowing would be resorted to if it should prove
to be necessary.”

[70] See Chap. VII.

[71] See p. 215.

[72] The Government was on the point of sanctioning this advance when
the urgent necessity for it came to an end, and the advance was not
actually made.

[73] I will recur to this proposal in Chapter VII.

[74] For the movements of the Indian bank–rate in the autumn and spring
of 1907–8, see the chart appended to Chap. VIII. Eventually, on January
16, 1908, the Bengal rate did rise to 9 per cent (the Bombay rate did
not rise to this level until February 7); but this is not very abnormal
in the winter, and the average rate for money in 1907–8 was lower than
in the corresponding season of the two busy years 1905–6 and 1906–7.

[75] For a fuller discussion of this question in relation to the events
of 1907–8, see my article on “Recent Economic Events in India” in the
_Economic Journal_, March 1909.

[76] Aggregate exports of Indian produce and manufactures: 1906–7,
£115,625,135; 1911–12, £147,813,000.

[77] The Government of India stands in a particularly strong position
in this respect, because few countries have so good a market for their
loans at a foreign centre as India has.

[78] In continuation of what has been said in § 4.

[79] See Brunyate, _loc. cit._ chap. vii., from which the greater part
of what follows is summarised.

[80] All this refers to the balances at the Head Offices. “There is no
limit to the Government deposits at branch offices. But the latter are
held absolutely at call, and in actual practice are removed with the
utmost freedom.”—Brunyate, _loc. cit._ p. 98.

[81] See table given on p. 204.

[82] The exceptional circumstances of 1913 are dealt with in Chap. VIII.

[83] See Report of Comptroller of Currency, 1911–12: “In July the
balance generally reaches its highest level. From July onwards until
December the revenue collections are comparatively small and the
balances steadily go down till they reach their minimum level in
November or December. After December the surplus revenue receipts far
exceed the demands for expenditure.”

[84] See also Lord Inchcape’s letter to the _Times_ of November 12,
1912. I forbear to enter in detail into what is not, in reality, one of
the truly vital aspects of Indian Government Finance.

[85] The payments to the Government broker, from which, no doubt, some
deduction has to be made for expenses, have been as follows:—

       1908                   £2,642
       1909                    6,396
       1910                   12,728
       1911                   10,544
       1912 (up to Dec. 14)    7,958

The principles governing the amount of these payments were explained in
the House of Commons on December 17, 1912, in answer to a question.

[86] See Mr. J. B. Brunyate’s _Account of the Presidency Banks_ (1900),
whence the historical details which follow have been chiefly derived.
Mr. Brunyate’s _Account_ is of the highest value to students of banking
history.

[87] The first Bank of Bombay went into liquidation in 1868, although
its liabilities were eventually paid up in full. A new Bank of Bombay
was formed in the same year.

[88] By 1862 such issues were of negligible account, but in earlier
times they had been important. “Probably the first banking institution
in India, on European lines, was the Bank of Hindustan, which was
established in Calcutta about 1770 by a private trading firm. The
notes of this Bank, though not recognised by the Government, obtained
a local circulation which occasionally reached forty or fifty lakhs
and generally averaged about half that amount.” It is said that they
were “received for many years at all the public offices in Calcutta
scarcely excepting the Treasury itself.” On two occasions, once in 1819
and again in 1829, the occurrence of a panic led to the presentation
for payment of about twenty lakhs’ worth of the notes, and the demand
was promptly met. (Brunyate, _loc. cit._ p. 55.) This Bank and others
disappeared in the commercial disasters of 1829–1832. “Out of their
ruin rose the Union Bank, a Joint Stock Bank created by co–operation
among all the leading Calcutta houses.” (Brunyate, _loc. cit._ p.
59.) In 1834 the Bank of Bengal refused to accept the notes of its
formidable rival, and in 1848 the Union Bank disappeared.

[89] This was in some degree consequent on the failure of the Bank
of Bombay in 1868, the Government having found itself in the awkward
position of being a shareholder in a Bank, its liability for which was
not clearly defined.

[90] The way in which Indian institutions have been moulded on and
influenced by English is interestingly illustrated by the fact that
several of the provisions in the Charters of the Presidency Banks were
copied from the 1695 constitution of the Bank of England.

[91] This also was partly consequent on the failure of the Bank of
Bombay in 1868.

[92] Except for the use of principals for the purpose of certain
specified kinds of remittance.

[93] In 1877 the Banks pressed strongly for a relaxation of this
provision. But the Secretary of State held that “the concession of
a power of creating a foreign agency in England, such as would be
the result of entering into loan transactions of the nature of those
contemplated, would admit of the Banks locking up a large portion
of their capital at so great a distance as to render it practically
unavailable in the case of any emergency arising in India.” This
argument is not one which would be likely to be used at the present
time. The fear would rather be lest they should lock up funds in India.

[94] Up to 1907 the maximum period was three months.

[95] See §§ 36–38 of Chapter VI.

[96] The rupee has been converted at the uniform rate of 1s. 4d.
throughout.

[97] This is the date of the foundation of this Bank under its present
style, but it was formed out of the old Chartered Mercantile Bank of
India, London and China, which dates much further back.

[98] The Chartered Bank, in spite of its name, has never done business
in Australia.

[99] But not exclusively. The National Bank, for example, has a large
interest in East Africa; this coast has considerable trade connexions
with India, and the rupee has a fairly wide circulation there (see
figures of rupees exported given on p. 154).

[100] The New Oriental Bank, established in 1885 (the great Oriental
Bank Corporation had failed in 1884), went into liquidation in 1893.

[101] I fancy that it has more the character of an Indian Joint Stock
Bank and less of the character of an Exchange Bank than the others.

[102] The Eastern Bank was established under the auspices of Messrs.
E. D. Sassoon, while two important French Banks and Messrs. Brown,
Shipley, and Co. are represented on the board of directors.

[103] There is of course much business of a semi–banking character
transacted by financial and mercantile houses, some of them of the
first magnitude, with establishments both in India and London. But they
are private firms and publish no information about their business of
which it is possible to take account.

[104] Another method occasionally worth while employing is the purchase
of Government Rupee Paper in London and its sale in India.

[105] The volume of bills, drawn in India on London and outstanding,
is not, of course, a correct measure of the extent to which India
is being financed abroad. A bill may be used to finance the foreign
purchaser just as much as the Indian seller. For example, a dealer in
cotton in India might be paid by a 3 m/s Bank credit supplied by the
buyer, a Continental spinner; this spinner might get the cotton within
a fortnight of the acceptance of the bill, which would, therefore, be
really financing his cotton factory.

[106] The figures for 1910, for example, are in the issue which was
obtainable in England early in 1913.

[107] On the one hand, these balances are even weaker than they look,
because they include the Exchange Banks’ balances at the Presidency
Banks. On the other hand, the Exchange Banks often have sovereigns or
Council Bills in transit which they may fairly consider, perhaps, as
equivalent to cash.

[108] A certain proportion of their bills, no doubt, are drawn on the
London branches of Banks with a foreign domicile. These bills are not
always so readily discountable as London acceptances, the Bank of
England taking them unwillingly and charging ¼ per cent extra discount.
But for the present purpose they can, I think, be regarded none the
less as liquid London assets.

[109] I believe that the Eastern Bank offers rather better terms than
the other Banks for fixed deposits.

[110] The confusing point here is this: that (ix.) is the amount
advanced to Indian merchants, and (x.) the amount advanced to English
merchants; yet (ix.) must be reckoned an English asset and (x.) an
Indian asset. For (ix.) when it falls due is paid in England, although,
of course, the Bank has advanced money, through the purchase of it, in
India.

[111] It would be most useful to have a triple classification—India,
London, and elsewhere. But I do not see how the Indian authorities
could reasonably enforce this.

[112] The great majority (363) of these small money–lending
establishments were registered in Madras. Most of them are mutual
societies, and it would not be difficult to exclude them from the
official statistics.

[113] There is also, on a smaller scale, the Bangalore Bank (1868).

[114] There are a few others on a very small scale, such as the Kashmir
Bank (1882), and the Poona Mercantile Bank (1893).

[115] In 1901 the People’s Bank of India was founded, but it did not
reach the 5 lakhs’ limit until 1908.

[116] The Bank of India has a paid–up capital of 50 lakhs and a reserve
and rest of 5½ lakhs; the corresponding figures for the Indian Specie
Bank are 75 lakhs and 19 lakhs. The Bank of Rangoon is on a smaller
scale and has been less successful.

[117] This represents compound interest at the rate of about 8 per cent
per annum.

[118] Here again it is tantalising that no later figures should be
available.

[119] In the official statistics no definition is given of what
precisely is meant by “cash.”

[120] The Co–operative Credit Societies are not important in this
connexion, capital, reserves, loans, and deposits altogether being less
than £1,000,000.

[121] At the time of writing, this Bill has not yet passed through its
final stages.

[122] In the published balance sheet, which I have before me, of one of
the largest of these little Banks, the cash is lumped together with the
“investments,” _i.e._, with the Bank’s speculations.

[123] These quotations are derived from Mr. Brunyate’s _Account_, _loc.
cit._

[124] In their Despatch dealing with the Report of the Fowler
Committee (August 24, 1899) the Government of India went so far as to
declare that the constitution of a State Bank, by the amalgamation
and absorption of the three Presidency Banks, was desirable. For the
circumstances and discussions which led up to the ultimate abandonment
of these ideas, see “Papers relating to the Proposed Establishment of
a Central Bank in India (reprinted from the _Gazette of India_ and
_Supplement_, dated the 12th Oct. 1901).”

[125] I am indebted for the preparation of this chart to Mr. H.
Bellingham of the India Office.

[126] The Bengal Bank Rate was at 7 or 8 per cent from November 28,
1912, to April 17, 1913, and the Bombay Bank Rate at no less than 8 per
cent from December 27, 1912, to April 8, 1913.

[127] The Bank of England’s rate was 5 per cent, with the market rate
well up to the Bank Rate; and the _difference_ between the current
rates for money in London and India was probably, for the time of year,
not much greater than usual.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
