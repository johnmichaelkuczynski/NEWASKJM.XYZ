REDESIGN PROPOSAL FOR FICTION WRITING MODULE

PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS:
Workflow F only works for specific input types. The philosophy of mind text failed because you can't "show a world" where an abstract cognitive thesis is true—it's invisible, internal, and doesn't produce distinctive observable social patterns.

WORKFLOW COMPATIBILITY BY INPUT TYPE:

**Workflow F (Thesis to World)** - ONLY works for:
- Claims about how people/society BEHAVES
- Observable social patterns
- Examples: "People are selfish," "Capitalism bifurcates society," "Modern institutions reward the strong"
- Does NOT work for: abstract epistemology, cognitive architecture, metaphysical claims

**Workflow E (Prediction Realized)** - ONLY works for:
- Explicit predictions about future events
- Examples: Marx on capitalism, demographic predictions, technology forecasts
- Limited applicability

**Workflow A (Nightmare)** - Works for MOST passionate non-fiction:
- Identify the author's underlying anxiety/fear
- Show realistic scenario where that fear materializes
- Works for: psychology, philosophy, politics, personal essays, academic disputes
- Most universal application

RECOMMENDATION:
**Start with Workflow A (Nightmare) as the first function, NOT Workflow F.**

Why:
1. Most non-fiction is anxiety-driven (that's why people write it)
2. Identifying fear is easier than categorizing thesis types
3. Nightmare scenarios naturally create tension/stakes (unlike documentary lists)
4. Works across disciplines (philosophy, psychology, politics, personal)

The philosophy of mind input would work as nightmare:
- Author fears linguistic-turn philosophy has imprisoned thought
- Show world where everyone's cognition becomes fully linguistically mediated
- Direct perception atrophies, everything requires verbal decoding
- People lose ability to think without inner monologue
- Write as realistic, matter-of-fact reportage of this happening

PROPOSED FIRST IMPLEMENTATION:
"Convert to Nightmare" - Input non-fiction → Identify core anxiety → Depict realistic scenario where it materializes

Then add others later: B (wish-fulfillment), C/D (love stories), E (prediction), F (behavioral thesis)

Should I write the nightmare workflow prompt?
