54. VIEW: Differences in opinions between the two authors arise from natural and justifiable differences in their interpretations and conjectures.

   EVIDENCE: "As regards my share of the book, too, the only possible decision has been that the text of the first edition shall be reprinted without alteration."

63. VIEW: The developments and changes in Freud's views have been too far-reaching to be attached to his earlier exposition without destroying its essential character.
   EVIDENCE: "The developments and changes in my views during the course of thirteen years of work have been too far-reaching for it to be possible to attach them to my earlier exposition without entirely destroying its essential character."

64. VIEW: Freud does not wish to eliminate the evidence of his initial views.
   EVIDENCE: "Nor have I any reason for wishing to eliminate this evidence of my initial views."

   EVIDENCE: "Even to-day I regard them not as errors but as valuable first approximations to knowledge which could only be fully acquired after long and continuous efforts."

66. VIEW: The germs of all that has since been added to the theory of catharsis can be detected in the present book.
   EVIDENCE: "The attentive reader will be able to detect in the present book the germs of all that has since been added to the theory of catharsis:"

67. VIEW: Psychosexual factors and infantilism play a part in the theory of catharsis.
   EVIDENCE: "for instance, the part played by psychosexual factors and infantilism"

68. VIEW: Dreams and unconscious symbolism are important in the theory of catharsis.
   EVIDENCE: "the importance of dreams and of unconscious symbolism."

69. VIEW: The connection between a precipitating event and a resulting phenomenon can be evident and clear.
   EVIDENCE: "The connection is often so clear that it is quite evident how it was that the precipitating event produced this particular phenomenon rather than any other."

70. VIEW: A symptom can be determined by its precipitating cause.
   EVIDENCE: "In that case the symptom has quite obviously been determined by the precipitating cause."

71. VIEW: Suppressed emotions during a meal can lead to hysterical vomiting.
   EVIDENCE: "a painful emotion arising during a meal but suppressed at the time, and the producing nausea and vomiting which persists for months in the form of hysterical vomiting."

72. VIEW: Anxiety and hallucinations can lead to physical symptoms like paresis, contracture, and anaesthesia.
   EVIDENCE: "a torment of anxiety, fell into a twilight state and had a terrifying hallucination, while her right arm, which was hanging over the back of the chair, went to sleep; from this there developed a paresis of the same arm accompanied by contracture and anaesthesia."

73. VIEW: Severe hysteria can result in the loss of one's native language and the ability to only communicate in a secondary language.
   EVIDENCE: "When subsequently a severe and highly complicated hysteria developed, she could only speak, write and understand English, while her native language remained unintelligible to her for eighteen months."

74. VIEW: The intention to remain still can paradoxically result in involuntary movements, such as a 'clacking' noise with the tongue.
   EVIDENCE: "Precisely on account of her intention she made a 'clacking' noise with her tongue. (An instance of 'hysterical counter-will'.)"

75. VIEW: A tic can develop from an involuntary noise and persist for many years.
   EVIDENCE: "This noise was repeated on a subsequent occasion on which she wished to keep perfectly still; and from it there developed a tic which, in the form of a clacking with the tongue, occurred over a period of many years whenever she felt excited."

76. VIEW: Witnessing a medical procedure can cause sympathetic physical pain in the observer.
   EVIDENCE: "At the instant at which the joint gave way with a crack, he felt a violent pain in his own hip-joint, which persisted for nearly a year."

77. VIEW: The connection between a precipitating cause and a pathological phenomenon can be symbolic, similar to dream symbolism.
   EVIDENCE: "It consists only in what might be called a 'symbolic' relation between the precipitating cause and the pathological phenomenon - a relation such as healthy people form in dreams."

78. VIEW: Mental pain can lead to physical symptoms like neuralgia, and moral disgust can lead to vomiting.
   EVIDENCE: "For instance, a neuralgia may follow upon mental pain or vomiting upon a feeling of moral disgust."

79. VIEW: Typical hysterical symptoms like hemi-anaesthesia and epileptiform convulsions are not easily understood in terms of their precipitating causes.
   EVIDENCE: "It is precisely the typical hysterical symptoms which fall into this class, such as hemi-anaesthesia, contraction of the field of vision, epileptiform convulsions, and so on."

80. VIEW: There is an analogy between the pathogenesis of common hysteria and traumatic neuroses.
   EVIDENCE: "Observations such as these seem to us to establish an analogy between the pathogenesis of common hysteria and that of the traumatic neuroses, and to justify an extension of the concept of traumatic hysteria."

81. VIEW: In traumatic neuroses, the operative cause of the illness is the affect of fright, not the physical injury.
   EVIDENCE: "In traumatic neuroses the operative cause of the illness is not the trifling physical injury but the affect of fright - the psychical trauma."

82. VIEW: Many hysterical symptoms have precipitating causes that are psychical traumas.
   EVIDENCE: "In an analogous manner, our investigations reveal, for many, if not for most, hysterical symptoms, precipitating causes which can only be described as psychical traumas."

83. VIEW: Any experience causing distressing affects can operate as a psychical trauma.
   EVIDENCE: "Any experience which calls up distressing affects - such as those of fright, anxiety, shame or physical pain - may operate as a trauma of this kind;"

84. VIEW: In common hysteria, multiple partial traumas can collectively act as provoking causes.
   EVIDENCE: "In the case of common hysteria it not infrequently happens that, instead of a single, major trauma, we find a number of partial traumas forming a group of provoking causes."

85. VIEW: An apparently trivial circumstance can attain the status of a trauma if it occurs at a time of peculiar susceptibility.
   EVIDENCE: "There are other cases in which an apparently trivial circumstance combines with the actually operative event or occurs at a time of peculiar susceptibility to stimulation and in this way attains the dignity of a trauma which it would not otherwise have possessed but which thenceforward persists."

86. VIEW: The memory of a psychical trauma continues to act as an agent that is still at work, influencing hysterical symptoms.
   EVIDENCE: "We must presume rather that the psychical trauma - or more precisely the memory of the trauma - acts like a foreign body which long after its entry must continue to be regarded as an agent that is still at work;"

87. VIEW: Hysterical symptoms disappear when the memory of the precipitating event is vividly recalled and the accompanying affect is expressed.
   EVIDENCE: "For we found, to our great surprise at first, that each individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect, and when the patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into words."

88. VIEW: Recollection without affect almost invariably produces no result in treating hysterical symptoms.
   EVIDENCE: "Recollection without affect almost invariably produces no result."

89. VIEW: The hypnotist promotes cure by putting the subject back into the state where the trouble first appeared and using words to combat the trouble as it re-emerges.
   EVIDENCE: "He puts the subject back into the state in which his trouble first appeared and uses words to combat that trouble, as it now makes a fresh emergence."

90. VIEW: Taking the patient back to the moment the symptom first appeared can make them more susceptible to therapeutic suggestion.
   EVIDENCE: "we shall perhaps find that by taking the patient back by mean of a mental artifice to the very moment at which the symptom first appeared, we may make him more susceptible to a therapeutic suggestion."

91. VIEW: The cure of a hysterical girl was achieved by a method analogous to the one described.
   EVIDENCE: "there is an account of the cure of a hysterical girl by a method analogous to ours."

92. VIEW: It is not unconscious suggestion that relieves the patient of their sufferings, but the verbal utterance itself.
   EVIDENCE: "This, however, is not so."

93. VIEW: The first case of hysteria analyzed in this manner dates back to 1881, before the era of suggestion.
   EVIDENCE: "The first case of this kind that came under observation dates back to the year 1881, that is to say to the 'pre-suggestion' era."

94. VIEW: A highly complicated case of hysteria was analyzed, and its symptoms, which had separate causes, were removed separately.
   EVIDENCE: "A highly complicated case of hysteria was analysed in this way, and the symptoms, which sprang from separate causes, were separately removed."

95. VIEW: The observation of the hysteria case was made possible by the patient's spontaneous auto-hypnoses.
   EVIDENCE: "This observation was made possible by spontaneous auto-hypnoses on the part of the patient, and came as a great surprise to the observer."

96. VIEW: The determining process of hysteria continues to operate directly for years, not indirectly through intermediate causal links.
   EVIDENCE: "we may reverse the dictum 'cessante causa cessat effectuss' ['when the cause ceases the effect ceases'] and conclude from these observations that the determining process continues to operate in some way or other for years - not indirectly, through a chain of intermediate causal links, but as a directly releasing cause"

97. VIEW: Hysterics suffer mainly from reminiscences.
   EVIDENCE: "Hysterics suffer mainly from reminiscences."

98. VIEW: The fading of a memory or the losing of its affect depends on various factors, the most important being whether there has been an energetic reaction to the event that provokes the affect.
   EVIDENCE: "The fading of a memory or the losing of its affect depends on various factors. The most important of these is whether there has been an energetic reaction to the event that provokes the affect."

99. VIEW: By 'reaction', the author understands the whole class of voluntary and involuntary reflexes, from tears to acts of revenge, in which the affects are discharged.
   EVIDENCE: "By 'reaction' we here understand the whole class of voluntary and involuntary reflexes - from tears to acts of revenge - in which, as experience shows us, the affects are discharged."

100. VIEW: If the reaction to an event is sufficient, a large part of the affect disappears as a result.
   EVIDENCE: "If this reaction takes place to a sufficient amount a large part of the affect disappears as a result."

101. VIEW: Linguistic usage reflects the fact that affects can be discharged through reactions like crying or raging.
   EVIDENCE: "Linguistic usage bears witness to this fact of daily observation by such phrases as 'to cry oneself out' ['sich ausweinen'], and to 'blow off steam' ['sich austoben', literally 'to rage oneself out']."

102. VIEW: If the reaction to an injury is suppressed, the affect remains attached to the memory.
   EVIDENCE: "If the reaction is suppressed, the affect remains attached to the memory."

103. VIEW: An injury that has been repaid, even if only in words, is recollected differently from one that has had to be accepted.
   EVIDENCE: "An injury that has been repaid, even if only in words, is recollected quite differently from one that has had to be accepted."

104. VIEW: Language recognizes the distinction between an injury that has been suffered in silence and one that has been expressed, describing the former as 'a mortification'.
   EVIDENCE: "Language recognizes this distinction, too, in its mental and physical consequences; it very characteristically describes an injury that has been suffered in silence as 'a mortification' ['Kränkung', literally 'making ill']."

105. VIEW: The reaction to a trauma only has a completely 'cathartic' effect if it is an adequate reaction, such as revenge.
   EVIDENCE: "The injured person's reaction to the trauma only exercises a completely 'cathartic' effect if it is an adequate reaction - as, for instance, revenge."

106. VIEW: Language can serve as a substitute for action and can almost as effectively 'abreact' an affect.
   EVIDENCE: "But language serves as a substitute for action; by its help, an affect can be 'abreacted' almost as effectively."

107. VIEW: Speaking can be an adequate reflex for dealing with an affect, such as in lamentation or confession.
   EVIDENCE: "In other cases speaking is itself the adequate reflex, when, for instance, it is a lamentation or giving utterance to a tormenting secret, e.g. a confession."

108. VIEW: If there is no reaction to an event, whether in deeds, words, or tears, the recollection of the event retains its affective tone.
   EVIDENCE: "If there is no such reaction, whether in deeds or words, or in the mildest cases in tears, any recollection of the event retains its affective tone to begin with."

109. VIEW: Memories of past lives are not at the patients' disposal.
   EVIDENCE: "these memories, unlike other memories of their past lives, are not at the patients' disposal."

110. VIEW: These experiences are completely absent from the patient's memory in a normal psychical state.
   EVIDENCE: "these experiences are completely absent from the patient's memory when they are in a normal psychical state"

111. VIEW: These memories are only present in highly summary form in a normal psychical state.
   EVIDENCE: "or are only present in highly summary form."

112. VIEW: Memories emerge with undiminished vividness under hypnosis.
   EVIDENCE: "Not until they have been questioned under hypnosis do these memories emerge with the undiminished vividness of a recent event."

113. VIEW: A patient reproduced everything that had excited her on the same day of the previous year under hypnosis.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, for six whole months, one of our patients reproduced under hypnosis with hallucinatory vividness everything that had excited her on the same day of the previous year"

114. VIEW: The completeness of the reproduction was proven by a diary kept by the patient's mother.
   EVIDENCE: "A diary kept by her mother with out her knowledge proved the completeness of the reproduction."

115. VIEW: Another patient re-lived events of a hysterical psychosis under hypnosis and during spontaneous attacks.
   EVIDENCE: "Another patient, partly under hypnosis and partly during spontaneous attacks, re-lived with hallucinatory clarity all the events of a hysterical psychosis"

116. VIEW: Certain memories of aetiological importance were found to be astonishingly intact and possess remarkable sensory force.
   EVIDENCE: "Moreover, certain memories of aetiological importance which dated back from fifteen to twenty-five years were found to be astonishingly intact and to possess remarkable sensory force"

117. VIEW: These memories act with all the affective strength of new experiences when they return.
   EVIDENCE: "and when they returned they acted with all the affective strength of new experiences."

118. VIEW: These memories constitute an exception in their relation to wearing-away processes.
   EVIDENCE: "This can only be explained on the view that these memories constitute an exception in their relation to all the wearing-away processes which we have discussed above."

119. VIEW: These memories correspond to traumas that have not been sufficiently abreacted.
   EVIDENCE: "It appears, that is to say, that these memories correspond to traumas that have not been sufficiently abreacted"

120. VIEW: There are at least two sets of conditions under which the reaction to the trauma fails to occur.
   EVIDENCE: "and if we enter more closely into the reasons which have prevented this, we find at least two sets of conditions under which the reaction to the trauma fails to occur."

121. VIEW: In the first group of conditions, patients have not reacted to a psychical trauma because the nature of the trauma excluded a reaction.
   EVIDENCE: "In the first group are those cases in which the patients have not reacted to a psychical trauma because the nature of the trauma excluded a reaction"

122. VIEW: Social circumstances can make a reaction to a trauma impossible.
   EVIDENCE: "as in the case of the apparently irreparable loss of a loved person or because social circumstance made a reaction impossible"

123. VIEW: Patients may intentionally repress memories of things they wish to forget.
   EVIDENCE: "or because it was a question of things which the patient wished to forget, and therefore intentionally repressed from his conscious thought and inhibited and suppressed."

124. VIEW: Under hypnosis, distressing things are found to be the basis of hysterical phenomena.
   EVIDENCE: "It is precisely distressing things of this kind that, under hypnosis, we find are the basis of hysterical phenomena"

125. VIEW: The second group of conditions is determined by the psychical states in which the patient received the experiences.
   EVIDENCE: "The second group of conditions are determined, not by the content of the memories but by the psychical states in which the patient received the experiences in question."

126. VIEW: Ideas that are not in themselves significant can persist due to their origin during severely paralysing affects.
   EVIDENCE: "For we find, under hypnosis, among the causes of hysterical symptoms ideas which are not in themselves significant, but whose persistence is due to the fact that they originated during the prevalence of severely paralysing affects"

127. VIEW: Ideas can persist due to their origin during abnormal psychical states.
   EVIDENCE: "such as fright, or during positively abnormal psychical states, such as the semi-hypnotic twilight state of day-dreaming, auto-hypnoses, and so on."

128. VIEW: The nature of the states can make a reaction to the event impossible.
   EVIDENCE: "In such cases it is the nature of the states which makes a reaction to the event impossible."

129. VIEW: Conscious processes vary in hypnosis from light drowsiness to somnambulism and from complete recollection to total amnesia.
   EVIDENCE: "remaining conscious processes must be supposed to vary just as happens in hypnosis, which ranges from a light drowsiness to somnambulism, from complete recollection to total amnesia."

130. VIEW: Hypnoid states present before the onset of manifest illness provide the soil for pathogenic memory and somatic phenomena.
   EVIDENCE: "If hypnoid states of this kind are already present before the onset of the manifest illness, they provide the soil in which the affect plants the pathogenic memory with its consequent somatic phenomena."

131. VIEW: Dispositional hysteria corresponds to the presence of hypnoid states before the onset of illness.
   EVIDENCE: "This corresponds to dispositional hysteria."

132. VIEW: Severe trauma or laborious suppression can cause a splitting-off of groups of ideas in otherwise unaffected people, leading to psychically acquired hysteria.
   EVIDENCE: "We have found, however, that a severe trauma (such as occurs in a traumatic neurosis) or a laborious suppression (as of a sexual affect, for instance) can bring about a splitting-off of groups of ideas even in people who are in other respects unaffected; and this would be the mechanism of psychically acquired hysteria."

133. VIEW: There exists a series of cases between dispositional and psychically acquired hysteria where the liability to dissociation and the affective magnitude of the trauma vary inversely.
   EVIDENCE: "Between the extremes of these two forms we must assume the existence of a series of cases within which the liability to dissociation in the subject and the affective magnitude of the trauma vary inversely."

134. VIEW: Dispositional hypnoid states often grow out of day-dreams, which are common even in healthy people.
   EVIDENCE: "They often, it would seem, grow out of the day-dreams which are so common even in healthy people and to which needlework and similar occupations render women especially prone."

135. VIEW: The stability and influence of pathological associations in hypnoid states on somatic processes is a general problem related to the effectiveness of hypnotic suggestions.
   EVIDENCE: "Why it is that the 'pathological associations' brought about in these states are so stable and why they have so much more influence on somatic processes than ideas are usually found to do - these questions coincide with the general problem of the effectiveness of hypnotic suggestions."

136. VIEW: Hysterics can be people of the clearest intellect, strongest will, greatest character, and highest critical power in their waking thoughts.
   EVIDENCE: "But they throw a light on the contradiction between the dictum 'hysteria is a psychosis' and the fact that among hysterics may be found people of the clearest intellect, strongest will, greatest character and highest critical power."

137. VIEW: In their hypnoid states, hysterics are insane, similar to how everyone is in dreams.
   EVIDENCE: "This characterization holds good of their waking thoughts; but in their hypnoid states they are insane, as we all are in dreams."

138. VIEW: The products of hypnoid states intrude into waking life in the form of hysterical symptoms, unlike dream-psychoses which have no effect on the waking state.
   EVIDENCE: "Whereas, however, our dream-psychoses have no effect upon our waking state, the products of hypnoid states intrude into waking life in the form of hysterical symptoms."

139. VIEW: Chronic hysterical symptoms can be applied almost completely to hysterical attacks.
   EVIDENCE: "What we have asserted of chronic hysterical symptoms can be applied almost completely to hysterical attacks."

140. VIEW: Charcot described the 'major' hysterical attack with four phases: epileptoid, large movements, 'attitudes passionelles', and terminal delirium.
   EVIDENCE: "Charcot, as is well known, has given us a schematic description of the 'major' hysterical attack, according to which four phases can be distinguished in a complete attack: (1) the epileptoid phase, (2) the phase of large movements, (3) the phase of 'attitudes passionelles' (the hallucinatory phase), and (4) the phase of terminal delirium."

141. VIEW: All forms of hysterical attack derive from the abbreviation, absence, or isolation of the four phases described by Charcot.
   EVIDENCE: "Charcot derives all those forms of hysterical attack which are in practice met with more often than the complete 'grande attaque', from the abbreviation, absence or isolation of these four distinct phases."

142. VIEW: The phase of 'attitudes passionelles' in a well-marked form exhibits the hallucinatory reproduction of a memory important in bringing about the onset of hysteria.
   EVIDENCE: "Our attempted explanation takes its start from the third of these phases, that of the 'attitudes passionelles'. Where this is present in a well-marked form, it exhibits the hallucinatory reproduction of a memory which was of importance in bringing about the onset of the hysteria."

143. VIEW: Hysterical attacks can revive memories of a single major trauma, a series of interconnected part-traumas, or events emphasized due to a special disposition to trauma.
   EVIDENCE: "the memory either of a single major trauma (which we find par excellence in what is called traumatic hysteria) or of a series of interconnected part-traumas (such as underlie common hysteria). Or, lastly, the attack may revive the events which have become emphasized owing to their coinciding with a moment of special disposition to trauma."

144. VIEW: Attacks that appear to consist exclusively of motor phenomena also have an underlying memory of psychical trauma or series of traumas.
   EVIDENCE: "There are also attacks, however, which appear to consist exclusively of motor phenomena and in which the phase of attitudes passionelles is absent. If one can succeed in getting into rapport with the patient during an attack such as this of generalized clonic spasms or cataleptic rigidity, or during an attaque de somneil [attack of sleep] - or if, better still, one can succeed in provoking the attack under hypnosis - one finds that here, too, there is an underlying memory of the psychical trauma or series of traumas."

145. VIEW: A little girl's convulsions were diagnosed as hysterical after hypnosis revealed a memory of being chased by a dog.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, a little girl suffered for years from attacks of general convulsions which could well be, and indeed were, regarded as epileptic. She was hypnotized with a view to a differential diagnosis, and promptly had one of her attacks. She was asked what, she was seeing and replied 'The dog! the dog's coming!'; and in fact it turned out that she had had the first of her attacks after being chased by a savage dog."

146. VIEW: An employee's hysterical attacks were related to memories of being ill-treated by his superior and a scene in a law court.
   EVIDENCE: "Again, an employee who had become a hysteric as a result of being ill-treated by his superior, suffered from attacks in which he collapsed and fell into a frenzy of rage, but without uttering a word or giving any sign of a hallucination. It was possible to provoke an attack under hypnosis, and the patient then revealed that he was living through the scene in which his employer had abused him in the street and hit him with a stick. A few days later the patient came back and complained of having had another attack of the same kind. On this occasion it turned out under hypnosis that he had been re-living the scene to which the actual onset of the illness was related: the scene in the law-court when he failed to obtain satisfaction for his maltreatment."

147. VIEW: Memories underlying hysterical attacks relate to psychical traumas not disposed of by abreaction or associative thought activity.
   EVIDENCE: "Like these latter causes, the memories underlying hysterical attacks relate to psychical traumas which have not been disposed of by abreaction or by associative thought activity."

148. VIEW: Memories underlying hysterical attacks are out of reach of normal consciousness and belong to the ideational content of hypnoid states.
   EVIDENCE: "Like them, they are, whether completely or in essential elements, out of reach of the memory of normal consciousness and are found to belong to the ideational content of hypnoid states of consciousness with restricted association."

149. VIEW: The motor phenomena of hysterical attacks can be interpreted as universal forms of reaction appropriate to the affect accompanying the memory.
   EVIDENCE: "The motor phenomena of hysterical attacks can be interpreted partly as universal forms of reaction appropriate to the affect accompanying the memory (such as kicking about and waving the arms and legs, which even young babies do)"

150. VIEW: The motor phenomena of hysterical attacks can be interpreted as a direct expression of memories.
   EVIDENCE: "partly as a direct expression of these memories"

151. VIEW: Some motor phenomena of hysterical attacks cannot be explained as universal forms of reaction or direct expressions of memories.
   EVIDENCE: "but in part, like the hysterical stigmata found among the chronic symptoms, they cannot be explained in this way"

152. VIEW: Hysterical attacks appear in a specially interesting light when considering the theory of groups of ideas originating in hypnoid states.
   EVIDENCE: "Hysterical attacks, furthermore, appear in a specially interesting light if we bear in mind a theory that we have mentioned above, namely, that in hysteria groups of ideas originating in hypnoid states are present"

153. VIEW: In hysteria, groups of ideas originating in hypnoid states are present and cut off from associative connection with other ideas.
   EVIDENCE: "that in hysteria groups of ideas originating in hypnoid states are present and that these are cut off from associative connection with the other ideas"

154. VIEW: Groups of ideas in hysteria can be associated among themselves and form a rudiment of a second consciousness.
   EVIDENCE: "but can be associated among themselves, and thus form the more or less highly organized rudiment of a second consciousness, a condition seconde"

155. VIEW: A chronic hysterical symptom corresponds to the intrusion of the second state into the somatic innervation.
   EVIDENCE: "a chronic hysterical symptom will correspond to the intrusion of this second state into the somatic innervation which is as a rule under the control of normal consciousness"

156. VIEW: A hysterical attack is evidence of a higher organization of the second state.
   EVIDENCE: "A hysterical attack, on the other hand, is evidence of a higher organization of this second state"

157. VIEW: The first appearance of a hysterical attack indicates a moment when the hypnoid consciousness has obtained control of the subject's whole existence.
   EVIDENCE: "When the attack makes its first appearance, it indicates a moment at which this hypnoid consciousness has obtained control of the subject's whole existence"

158. VIEW: A hysterical attack containing a memory points to a return of the moment when the hypnoid consciousness first obtained control.
   EVIDENCE: "when it occurs on subsequent occasions and contains a memory it points to a return of that moment"

159. VIEW: Hysterical attacks are a rudimentary form of a condition seconde according to Charcot.
   EVIDENCE: "Charcot has already suggested that hysterical attacks are a rudimentary form of a condition seconde"

160. VIEW: During a hysterical attack, control over the whole of the somatic innervation passes over to the hypnoid consciousness.
   EVIDENCE: "During the attack, control over the whole of the somatic innervation passes over to the hypnoid consciousness"

161. VIEW: Normal consciousness is not always entirely repressed during a hysterical attack.
   EVIDENCE: "Normal consciousness, as well-known observations show, is not always entirely repressed"

162. VIEW: Normal consciousness may be aware of the motor phenomena of the attack while the accompanying psychical events are outside its knowledge.
   EVIDENCE: "It may even be aware of the motor phenomena of the attack, while the accompanying psychical events are outside its knowledge"

163. VIEW: The typical course of a severe case of hysteria begins with the formation of an ideational content during hypnoid states.
   EVIDENCE: "The typical course of a severe case of hysteria is, as we know, as follows. To begin with, an ideational content is formed during hypnoid states"

164. VIEW: When the ideational content has increased sufficiently, it gains control during a period of acute hysteria.
   EVIDENCE: "when this has increased to a sufficient extent, it gains control, during a period of 'acute hysteria', of the somatic innervation and of the patient's whole existence"

165. VIEW: During acute hysteria, the ideational content creates chronic symptoms and attacks.
   EVIDENCE: "and creates chronic symptoms and attacks"

166. VIEW: After acute hysteria, the condition clears up apart from certain residues.
   EVIDENCE: "after this it clears up, apart from certain residues"

167. VIEW: If the normal personality regains control, what is left over from the hypnoid ideational content recurs in hysterical attacks.
   EVIDENCE: "If the normal personality can regain control, what is left over from the hypnoid ideational content recurs in hysterical attacks"

168. VIEW: Hysterical attacks put the subject back into similar states that are open to influence and susceptible to traumas.
   EVIDENCE: "and puts the subject back from time to time into similar states, which are themselves once more open to influence and susceptible to traumas"
