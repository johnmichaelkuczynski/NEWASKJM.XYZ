      "detailed_explanation": "In primitive societies, lacking natural causality, people attributed events to spirits and sought to bind them through sacrifices and sorcery, inverting the power dynamic where the weaker race dictates to the stronger (nature's spirits). This stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of nature as arbitrary rather than lawful.",
