CONCEPTION AND CAUSATION POSITION STATEMENT KUCZYNSKI 

POSITION STATEMENTS: KUCZYNSKI - CONCEPTION AND CAUSATION: SELECTED EARLY PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS

1. Human beings have always unconsciously known the theory of evolution, repressing this knowledge due to its threat to self-esteem.
2. The anatomical similarities between humans and other animals are so obvious that recognition of common ancestry is virtually inevitable.
3. When confronted with similar things, humans instinctively seek a common cause; the ability to accept coincidence marks non-instinctive thought.
4. Human self-conception as morally superior to animals is a defensive mechanism against the humiliating truth of our animal nature.
5. The biological basis of love and sex, involving excretory organs, reveals our fundamental animality despite idealized conceptions.
6. Sexual intercourse has always been regarded as indecent except under hyper-specific circumstances, proving awareness of our animal nature.
7. A proposition is the non-linguistic entity meant by a complete sentence, not the sentence itself.
8. Emotions are beliefs or are at least belief-like in that they can be true or false, rational or irrational.
9. Emotions answer to canons of rationality, which only beliefs can do; therefore emotions must be beliefs.
10. Moral statements express emotions, and since emotions are beliefs capable of truth and falsity, moral statements can be true or false.
11. Emotivism, properly understood, is a form of moral realism rather than anti-realism.
12. Awareness of norms cannot be acquired through behavioral conditioning; it must exist ab initio or not at all.
13. A society of normless individuals cannot collectively become aware of norms; norms cannot emerge from non-normative ingredients.
14. Understanding complex sentences presupposes grasping concepts; there is no way to reduce sentence comprehension to precognitive reactions.
15. To understand a complex sentence, one must grasp not just the concepts of its constituents but also the rules governing their composition.
16. A creature with purely de re awareness cannot make the leap to de dicto awareness through conditioning alone.
17. Lexical items do not come bundled the way concepts do; therefore lexical items cannot be our concepts, and we do not think in any language.
18. There is no such thing as Mentalese; we do not think in a language or symbolic code.
19. Constitutive relations among concepts are not containment relations among symbols.
20. The thought "that is a sphere" is different from, though constitutively connected with, the thought "that is a closed figure of uniform curvature."
21. Conceptual analysis and semantic analysis are not the same thing; a single semantic analysis may correspond to multiple conceptual analyses.
22. Color concepts are not mutually definable, yet they are constitutively interconnected; one cannot grasp one color without grasping others.
23. Any concept has constitutive connections to other concepts; conceptual atomism is false.
24. One cannot represent a single property to oneself without being able to represent other properties; representational capacities come in networks.
25. To grasp a specific shade of color, one must be able to distinguish it from other colors and thus grasp multiple colors.
26. If a creature could represent only one shade of color, its concept of that shade would collapse into a concept of color in general.
27. Properties are individuated by their relations to other properties; grasping a property requires grasping its place in a space of properties.
28. Degree properties like "weighing 1000 lbs" obviously require grasping related properties; this point generalizes to all properties.
29. A language must comprise basic expressions; otherwise knowledge of any expression would presuppose knowledge of an infinitely large lexicon.
30. Proper names are not definite descriptions, as Kripke decisively showed.
31. What we think does not, by itself, establish what our words and sentences mean; semantic externalism is correct.
32. Twin Earth cases show that the meanings of natural kind terms are not wholly determined by internal psychological states.
33. Content internalism is compatible with semantic externalism; linguistic meaning and cognitive content are distinct.
34. Reference-fixing should be distinguished from meaning-giving; this distinction dissolves many puzzles about concepts.
35. To have a concept of a thing is to know some proposition that describes that thing.
36. Knowledge of an existential proposition that uniquely describes x suffices for the ability to think about x.
37. Conception is sustained by knowledge of uniquely individuating descriptions, which may include indexical elements.
38. Recognition consists in seeing that one object satisfies two existence claims previously thought to be satisfied by different objects.
39. Phenomenal content does not supervene on propositional content; intentionalism is false.
40. Phenomenal content does not supervene on non-propositional representational content either.
41. Intentionalism over-predicts the amount of information borne by sensations.
42. A tickle or twinge is too simple and homogeneous to bear fine-grained propositions about anatomical structures.
43. Creatures can experience phenomenal contents like woozy feelings without possessing vast networks of representational capacities.
44. If intentionalism were true, a twinge would deliver vastly more information than such sensations actually deliver.
45. Phenomenal content is something altogether different from representational content—not identical with or supervenient on it.
46. Even restricted intentionalism (within sensory modalities) collapses into non-intentionalism upon examination.
47. There is no absolute correspondence between phenomenal and representational content.
48. Different phenomenal contents, even within the same modality, can bear the same representational content.
49. The relationship between phenomenal contents and their physical causes is like a "rule of projection" that could be different.
50. The Computational Theory of Mind (CTM) is false because there is no purely morphological characterization of syntax.
51. There is no purely syntactic characterization of logical truth; adequate characterizations must be partially semantic.
52. The only way to sensitize a thing to logical form is to sensitize it to semantics.
53. Turing machines do not compute in the relevant sense because they do not respond to semantics.
54. Adding numbers is never a purely mechanical, cognition-free operation even when done by the "quick and dirty" method.
55. A representationally innocent entity generating patterns of shapes does not constitute genuine computation.
56. Computing involves being sensitive to logical form, and logical form is buried in semantics.
57. The Ramsey-Lewis sentence method for defining theoretical terms is useless because functionalism cannot be articulated without vicious circularity.
58. Functionalism fails because it cannot non-circularly specify the mental states in terms of which functional roles are defined.
59. Content externalism strips mental content of causal efficacy; if externalism is true, content cannot explain behavior.
60. Program causes (as defined by Jackson and Pettit) do not rescue content externalism from the causal impotence objection.
61. Mental causation requires that mental content be causally relevant in a way externalism cannot accommodate.
62. Davidson's anomalous monism leads to epiphenomenalism about the mental.
63. Jerry Fodor's computationalism is pseudo-computationalism because he cannot adequately account for how syntax tracks semantics.
64. Fodor's main argument for conceptual atomism fails because constitutive connections are not containment relations.
65. Fodor confuses the claim that concepts are not decomposable with the claim that concepts lack constitutive connections to others.
66. Non-atomism does not require inferential role semantics (IRS); the inference from one to the other is fallacious.
67. Inferential role semantics faces the "error objection": if inferential roles define concepts, misapplication becomes impossible.
68. Inferential role semantics leads to an untenable holism where no two people can grasp the same proposition.
69. The bundle theory of personal identity is defensible when properly understood.
70. Propositions are sets of properties; truth is the instantiation of all members of that set.
71. A proposition like "Smith punches Jones" is a set containing properties corresponding to Smith, Jones, and the punching relation.
72. For a proposition to be true is for all of its component properties to be instantiated.
73. Propositions have decompositional structure; they are not merely specified by truth-conditions.
74. Analytically equivalent propositions can convey very different information.
75. Analytic propositions do typically convey information, contrary to Lewis's model.
76. Hempel's paradox is solved by recognizing that accidental generalizations do not receive support from their instances.
77. Only principled (nomic) generalizations receive confirmational support from their instances.
78. "If x is heated metal, x expands" and "If x isn't expanding, x isn't heated metal" are not confirmationally equivalent when read nomically.
79. Negative facts (like not being heated metal) are not fit to stand in nomic relations because they are not events or constituted by events.
80. A thing's not having a property is not nomically connected to anything, unlike a thing's having a property.
81. Inductions by enumeration are actually crypto-inferences to the best explanation.
82. Formal truth is truth by virtue of being an instance of a sentence-schema all of whose instances are true.
83. Formal truth is not identical with syntactic truth; there is no purely morphological characterization of logical form.
84. The equation of formal truth with syntactic truth is viciously circular.
85. Not all logical truths are formal truths; logic cannot be identified with the study of formal truth.
86. The most fundamental truths of logic must consist of non-formal, analytic truths.
87. The linguistic theory of logical truth (that logical truths are true by convention) is false.
88. Logical truths are not true merely in virtue of the meanings of words or linguistic conventions.
89. Conceivability sometimes entails possibility, providing a neo-Cartesian argument for dualism.
90. If mental properties are not identical with physical properties, and identity is necessary, then dualism follows.
91. Time travel is an incoherent concept.
92. Probabilistic causation is a genuine form of causation distinct from deterministic causation.
93. Simulated thought is not actual thought; genuine mental processes cannot be simulated by non-mental processes.
94. Davidson's views on rationality embody fundamental misconceptions.
95. Foundationalism about knowledge is compatible with non-atomism about concepts.
96. Intentionalism (the view that phenomenal properties are representational properties) fails both in restricted and unrestricted forms.
97. The veil of perception problem is exacerbated by externalism, not solved by it.
98. Representationalism about perception faces serious objections from the nature of phenomenal experience.
99. Understanding a sentence requires knowing multiple existence claims and their connections.
100. Identification is relative to background knowledge; being able to identify an object means connecting it to background knowledge.
101. A parrot cannot really say "it's getting hotter" because it lacks grasp of concepts and semantic rules.
102. For a sentence to have meaning for a speaker, it must have internal structure connected to concepts.
103. The meaning of complex sentences is a resultant, not a mere heaping together, of component meanings.
104. The word "fire" in isolation has the same semantics as in complex sentences; meaning operates through concepts uniformly.
105. Sense perceptions have existential content; the content of a perception is given by some bit of existential information.
106. Introspection, while limited, is reasonably reliable for apprehending the nature of phenomenal contents.
107. If phenomenal contents deliver information, our conscious minds must retrieve this information, suggesting we know our phenomenal contents well.

96. Intentionalism (the view that phenomenal properties are representational properties) fails both in restricted and unrestricted forms.
97. The veil of perception problem is exacerbated by externalism, not solved by it.
98. Representationalism about perception faces serious objections from the nature of phenomenal experience.
99. Understanding a sentence requires knowing multiple existence claims and their connections.
100. Identification is relative to background knowledge; being able to identify an object means connecting it to background knowledge.
101. A parrot cannot really say "it's getting hotter" because it lacks grasp of concepts and semantic rules.
102. For a sentence to have meaning for a speaker, it must have internal structure connected to concepts.
103. The meaning of complex sentences is a resultant, not a mere heaping together, of component meanings.
104. The word "fire" in isolation has the same semantics as in complex sentences; meaning operates through concepts uniformly.
105. Sense perceptions have existential content; the content of a perception is given by some bit of existential information.
106. Introspection, while limited, is reasonably reliable for apprehending the nature of phenomenal contents.
107. If phenomenal contents deliver information, our conscious minds must retrieve this information, suggesting we know our phenomenal contents well.
108. Kant's argument for synthetic a priori truths is spurious, but his important claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality are correct when de-psychologized.
109. Kant's premises actually entail the opposite of his thesis: there are virtually no a priori truths, making Kant more opposed to a priori truth than John Stuart Mill.
110. Kant confuses two different epistemological roles of mental imagery: as a vehicle for conceptual analysis and as an object of empirical study.
111. Kant's reasoning must be de-psychologized—his statements about psychology must be reinterpreted as statements about logic.
112. Conceptual necessity is non-psychological necessity that holds entirely in virtue of facts about concepts in the platonic sense.
113. The proposition "triangles have three sides" would still be true even if there were no sentient beings.
114. Representational necessity is a different category where propositions are necessarily true because of facts about our minds.
115. Wittgenstein's regress argument shows that grasping a norm is not a cognitive affair in the traditional sense of having an inner representation.
116. Grasping a norm consists in having certain dispositions, not in possessing some mental icon corresponding to that norm.
117. Knowing-how is not cognitive in the sense of involving a grasp of propositions; it is a kind of competence or sensitivity.
118. For Wittgenstein, to know what a sentence means is to know how to use it, which is to be coordinated with other people's usage.
119. Knowledge-how does ultimately reduce to knowledge-that; knowing how to do something consists in internally representing rules.
120. Brandom's account of how individuals acquire intentionality is circular: one cannot give and ask for reasons without first grasping reasons.
121. Locke, Kant, and classical philosophers were right that speaking is a kind of externalized thinking, not vice versa.
122. The idea that thinking is internalized speaking (Wittgenstein, Brandom) is false.
123. Given a group of creatures oblivious to norms, no amount of interaction will make any of them aware of norms.
124. The "buck cannot be passed onto society": a society of normless individuals will itself be normless.
125. A proposition is a special kind of norm: a standard against which reality is compared.
126. To expect dinner tomorrow, unlike expecting dinner now, requires de dicto awareness and grasp of concepts.
127. Ordinary stimuli have no internal structure, but sentences are articulate—their parts stand in significant relations.
128. Through Pavlovian training you can make a dog react to stimuli, but you cannot make it understand compound sentences.
129. Understanding "if there's smoke, there's fire" requires grasping the concepts of smoke and fire, not just particular instances.
130. Identity holds necessarily: if A can be distinct from B, then A must be distinct from B.
131. Logical possibility sometimes indicates actual possibility, but not always—the relevant difference involves object-dependent vs. object-independent concepts.
132. Whenever there is a disparity between logical and metaphysical possibility, it is underwritten by facts about object-dependent concepts.
133. Necessities underwritten wholly by object-independent concepts have logical possibility coinciding with metaphysical possibility.
134. Object-dependent concepts have actual spatiotemporal objects as constituents; object-independent concepts do not.
135. To grasp an object-involving proposition, one must have causal liaisons to the object; purely existential propositions can be grasped without such liaisons.
136. A brain in a vat could grasp purely existential propositions but not object-involving propositions about spatiotemporal objects.
137. There is no purely morphological characterization of syntax; syntax is buried in semantics.
138. Any expression could mean anything; given any entity, there is some language in which "172" denotes that entity.
139. There can be no algorithm deciding truth-value wholly on the basis of shape; truth-value requires morphology plus semantic background.
140. An algorithm is given by a conditional proposition: if such and such semantic system holds, then there is a morphological characterization of truth.
141. To apply an algorithm involves recognizing the truth of a multiply conditional proposition about semantics and shapes.
142. The manipulation of shapes is at most a causal consequence of actual computation—almost an epiphenomenon.
143. Even if there are algorithms for various domains, thought in those domains cannot be "mechanized."
144. There are two components to applying an algorithm: recognition of an operative semantic system (not mechanical) and patterns of shapes (can be mechanical).
145. Inference requires recognition that premises stand in a bearing relation (entailment or probabilification) to the conclusion.
146. To have a rational thought-process, symbols must follow one another in a way that embodies awareness of bearing-relations among them.
147. A computer's symbols follow one another in the right order, but this doesn't involve recognition of bearing relations—so computers don't really think.
148. A computation is a purely formal, syntax-driven inference where consideration of semantics plays no part.
149. Fodor's "solution" to how physics-driven brain activity can be logic-consistent involves a massive confusion.
150. The "tracking problem"—how purely descriptive brain activity embodies sensitivity to prescriptive norms—is not solved by CTM.
151. Nobody knows Mentalese; nobody understands its expressions; it isn't by being understood that Mentalese tokens facilitate thought.
152. Mentalese, if it existed, would differ radically from real languages because its expressions need not be understood to function.
153. The very concept of a "language of thought" is incoherent because languages require understanding to function.
154. Brains are governed entirely by the laws of physics, which are purely descriptive, not prescriptive.
155. Our mental lives are entirely realized by brain activity, yet our mental activity conforms to canons of good reasoning.
156. Laws of physics are not laws of rationality, so laws of rationality seemingly play no part in our thinking—yet clearly they do.
157. What we think largely determines what our expressions mean, but there is also an important non-psychological dimension to meaning.
158. Given psychological and behavioral indistinguishability, it does not follow that utterances have the same meanings.
159. Twin Earth cases show that two utterances can differ in meaning despite arising from psychologically identical states.
160. The word "water" refers to H2O even for speakers in the 1600s who knew nothing of chemistry.
161. If a substance were discovered to be XYZ rather than H2O, chemists would say it is extremely water-like, not that water is sometimes XYZ.
162. Semantic externalism is true: meaning is not wholly determined by internal psychological states.
163. Content internalism is also true: what we are thinking is wholly determined by our internal states.
164. The distinction between reference-fixing and meaning-giving dissolves the apparent tension between externalism about meaning and internalism about content.
165. The representational content of visual perception can be put into words and embodied in propositions.
166. All representational content is essentially propositional; there is no genuinely non-propositional representational content.
167. Functionalism gets the order of explanation wrong: you stop because you see a stop-sign, not vice versa.
168. For functionalism, a perception has its content in virtue of causing certain behavior—but content is what causes behavior.
169. If x exists in virtue of y's existing, then x cannot cause y to exist; so functionalism makes content causally inert.
170. Functionalism says you see a growling dog because you flee, but obviously you flee because you see a growling dog.
171. Whenever one adds a referring term to one's lexicon, it involves knowing some uniquely individuating description of the referent.
172. The semantics of a name are not existential-descriptive, but the act of learning the semantics is existential-descriptive.
173. Names are just labels semantically, but one learns which thing a name labels through existential-descriptive claims.
174. To avoid running afoul of Kripke's points, we must give operators like "refers to" narrow scope relative to descriptive content.
175. Recognition of an individual consists in seeing that one thing uniquely satisfies each of two existence claims.
176. Conception is sustained by knowledge of a series of interlocking existence claims; any given claim may be dropped and replaced.
177. At any juncture of having a conception of a thing, that conception involves knowledge of an existence claim.
178. The cognitive difference between "Hesperus is lovely" and "Phosphorous is lovely" is explained by different existence claims.
179. Intentionalism is guilty of what Sellars called "the myth of the given."
180. Visual sensations do not by themselves tell you what color an object is; background knowledge about environmental conditions is required.
181. Sensations coupled with background knowledge about conditions of perception tell you what properties objects have.
182. What makes a bit of phenomenal content have a given representational content is precisely the addition of background knowledge.
183. If Sellars is right about the myth of the given, then intentionalism must be completely wrong.
184. Perceivable properties require contextualizing information to be represented; they are not intrinsically associated with phenomenal contents.
185. Tickles and twinges bear only highly generic messages like "disturbance of some kind in such and such part of my body."
186. Sensations do not constitute high-resolution apprehensions of bodily conditions; they are fairly opaque and uninformative.
187. Intentionalism demands that sensations be very non-opaque and high-resolution, which they plainly are not.
188. Even if sensations bore non-propositional information, they still would not bear enough information to vindicate intentionalism.
189. Non-propositional content, if it exists, presupposes the same vast networks of representational capacities as propositional content.
190. The ability to have any kind of representation presupposes the ability to represent things as having properties.
191. A morphinated feeling of euphoria has no felt bodily location—no spatial representations seem involved.
192. Some phenomenal contents are "generalized" feelings not felt in any particular body part.
193. Knowing what is distinctive about a color involves knowing how it differs from other colors.
194. Grasping the specific character of a property involves grasping what distinguishes it from other properties.
195. One can grasp a specific shape-property only if one has a grasp of a whole "space" of shape properties.
196. Direct reference theory does not show that names express no concepts whatsoever.
197. Freud held that thoughts must be clothed in words to become conscious—a view with some merit.
198. Hume's ethical anti-realism is connected to his view that emotions are incapable of being true or false.
199. Emotions can be justified or unjustified, rational or irrational—properties that only beliefs can have.
200. People try to justify their emotions, both negative and positive, suggesting emotions answer to rational standards.
201. When someone narcotizes an irrational emotion, this presupposes that emotions can be evaluated as rational or irrational.
202. Moral statements embody emotions; since emotions are beliefs capable of truth and falsity, moral realism follows.
203. Speech-act semantics and tractarian semantics are not really opposed on the relation between sentences and propositions.
204. If a sentence bears a proposition, then ipso facto it enables one to express the corresponding belief.
205. Hempel's paradox arises only if we conflate accidental generalizations with principled (nomic) generalizations.
206. Accidental generalizations like "all heated metal expands" read as mere de facto concomitances don't receive support from instances.
207. Only nomic generalizations—those alleging causal or lawlike connections—receive confirmational support from their instances.
208. Nomic relations hold only among spatiotemporal entities; negative facts like "not being heated metal" are not spatiotemporal.
209. A thing's not having a property is like not destroying Jupiter—it is not an event and doesn't stand in nomic relations.
210. The operator "there is a nomic connection between..." doesn't permit intersubstitution of logically equivalent sentences.
211. Logically equivalent sentences can be truth-preservingly intersubstituted in some contexts but not in contexts governed by nomic operators.
212. Given that "P iff P" is formally true, the statement "all statements of the form P iff P are formally true" is itself not formal.
213. It is always on the basis of knowledge of non-formal truths that we know a given truth to be formal.
214. It is an empirical fact that logical connectives have the syntactic and semantic properties they have.
215. It is non-empirically true that, given their properties, certain connectives are truth-functional—this is analytic but non-formal.
216. Those non-formal, analytic truths are themselves part of logic and constitute its essence more than formal truths do.
217. Formal logic is to pure logic as engineering is to physics—formal logic is applied logic.
218. Logicians who dedicate themselves exclusively to formal work are applied logicians, not logicians in the truest sense.
219. Bradley's Logic and Mill's Treatise on Logic, despite containing no formal reasoning, are genuine works of logic.
220. A sentence is formally true if it is an instance of an open-sentence true for all values of its free variables.
221. A proposition is a property of a world; for a proposition to be true is for that property to be instantiated.
222. Truth can be identified with instantiatedness: a proposition is true exactly if that property is instantiated in the actual world.
223. Lewis's identification of propositions with properties of worlds is informative but viciously circular if taken as an analysis.
224. Propositions have decompositional structure that mere sets of worlds or functions from worlds to truth-values do not capture.
225. Analytic propositions do convey information, contrary to views that make them disappear as uninformative.
226. A true proposition is always true in virtue of something about the world—mass-energy distribution, ripples in the quantum.
227. The truth of "Plato punched Socrates" supervenes on facts about atomic movements describable without mentioning Plato or Socrates.
228. The property of having the right "rippling" of mass-energy is more basic than the proposition it makes true.
229. There is no circularity in analyzing propositions in terms of properties of worlds when those properties are more basic.
230. Different propositions can share constituents: "Smith punches Jones" and "Plato punches Jones" share the "punches Jones" component.
231. A proposition has components corresponding to incomplete properties like "x punches Jones" and "Smith punches x."
232. Frege's analysis that propositions are built from relations and functions captures the structure of propositions correctly.
233. A proposition is a set of properties; it is true when all its members are instantiated.
234. Each discrete constituent of a proposition corresponds to one property in the set that constitutes it.
235. Fodor's argument for atomism fails because constitutive connections among concepts are not containment relations.
236. Fodor confuses the claim that concepts resist decomposition with the claim that they lack constitutive connections.
237. One's pink-concept is not composed of other color-concepts, yet one cannot have it without having other color-concepts.
238. Color-symbols are not mutually definable; color concepts are not decomposable into other color concepts.
239. If color concepts literally contained other color concepts, any color thought would consist of infinitely many color thoughts—absurd.
240. Any attempt to block the infinite regress through looping definitions makes concept-possession presuppose itself.
241. One's concept of 1,143 presupposes concepts of 1,142, 1,141, etc., but 1,143-thoughts are not cobbled together from these.
242. Fodor is right that most concepts resist decomposition, but wrong that this means they lack constitutive connections.
243. Inferential role semantics makes it impossible for two people to grasp the same proposition.
244. For IRS, differences in inferential role mean differences in content; but no two cognitive states have identical inferential roles.
245. IRS faces the "error objection": if inferential roles define concepts, misapplication of concepts becomes impossible.
246. If IRS is right, wrong applications of a concept collapse into correct applications of some other concept—but plainly this is false.
247. The distinction between reference-fixing and meaning-giving saves non-atomism from the objections Fodor raises.
248. To have a concept of a thing is to know some proposition that describes (uniquely individuates) that thing.
249. Knowledge of a proposition describing x suffices for ability to think about x—it qualifies as a concept of x.
250. Once you know a proposition describing a thing, you can attribute any property you grasp to that thing.
251. Your concept of the number two is your belief in a proposition like "there is some number n such that n=1+1."
252. Changes in what else you believe about the number two do not change your concept of it.
253. The error objection is sidestepped: wrong beliefs about two are still about two because they attribute properties to what satisfies n=1+1.
254. Grasping a thing consists in grasping a proposition about that thing; one cannot just think a thing without thinking something about it.
255. Whatever is thought—whatever is grasped—is some truth or falsity, never just a bare object.
256. Knowing who a name refers to is contextual: relative to some existence claims you may know it, relative to others not.
257. Understanding a sentence-token is contextual because knowing what a term refers to is contextual.
