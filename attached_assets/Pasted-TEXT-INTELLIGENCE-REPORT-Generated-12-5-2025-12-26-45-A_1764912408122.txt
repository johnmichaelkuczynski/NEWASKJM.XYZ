This is demonstrated through examples like "Plato snores," "Bill is taller than Mary," and "Bill is standing between Mary and John," which are all treated as functions assigning truth-values.\n\n2. **Argument 2: Overcoming Grammatical Surface Structure**\n   - **Explanation:** Pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which led them to treat different types of atomic sentences as having different forms. Frege's method, by contrast, looks beyond surface grammar to the underlying logical structure, allowing for a more unified and effective formalization of inferences.\n\n3. **Argument 3: Functionality of Sentences**\n   - **Explanation:** Frege's view of sentences as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects provides a clear and systematic way to understand the meaning of sentences. This is illustrated by the examples of ‹x snores›, ‹x is taller than y›, and ‹x is standing between y and z›, which are all seen as functions that assign truth or falsehood based on the properties of their arguments.\n\n### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims\n\n1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Distinction Between Atomic and Molecular Sentences**\n   - **Explanation:** The text distinguishes between atomic sentences, which do not consist of other sentences or contain quantifiers, and molecular sentences, which do. This distinction is crucial for understanding the scope of Frege's analysis, which focuses on atomic sentences.\n\n2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Importance of Truth-Value Assignment**\n   - **Explanation:** The assignment of truth-values to sentences is central to Frege's approach, as it allows for a clear and systematic way to evaluate the truth or falsehood of statements based on the properties of their arguments.\n\n### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments\n\n1. **Assumption 1: Logical Structure Over Grammatical Form**\n   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form, and that understanding this logical structure is essential for formalizing inferences.\n\n2. **Assumption 2: Objectivity of Truth-Values**\n   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that truth-values are objective and can be assigned based on the properties of objects or sets of objects, rather than being subjective or context-dependent.\n\n3. **Assumption 3: Universality of the Function Approach**\n   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that the function approach to sentences is universally applicable to all atomic sentences, regardless of their surface grammatical structure.\n\n### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument\n\n1. **Premise 1:** All atomic sentences can be represented as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which led them to treat different types of atomic sentences as having different forms.\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Frege's method looks beyond surface grammar to the underlying logical structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Frege's approach allows for a more unified and effective formalization of atomic sentences, overcoming the limitations of pre-Fregean logic.\n\n### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text\n\n1. **Introduction of Frege's Approach:** The text begins by introducing Frege's method of treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values, using the example of "Plato snores" to illustrate the concept of an open sentence.\n\n2. **Expansion to More Complex Sentences:** The text then expands this approach to more complex sentences, such as "Bill is taller than Mary" and "Bill is standing between Mary and John," showing how these can also be represented as functions that assign truth-values to ordered pairs or triples of objects.\n\n3. **Comparison with Pre-Fregean Logic:** The text contrasts Frege's approach with that of pre-Fregean logicians, highlighting how the latter were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Unified Form of Atomic Sentences:** The text concludes by emphasizing that Frege's approach allows for a unified form for all atomic sentences, ‹O has psi›, which overcomes the limitations of pre-Fregean logic and enables more effective formalization of inferences.\n\n## SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS\n\n### 3.1 Quotation 1: Frege's Main Position\n\n- **Quote:** \"According to Frege, the occurrence of 'snores' in (PS) 'Plato snores' is best represented as the open sentence ‹x snores›; and that open sentence is best thought of as expressing a function that assigns the truth-value true to each snorer and the truth-value false to each thing that doesn't snore.\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears at the beginning of the text, where the author introduces Frege's approach to treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values.\n- **Significance:** This quotation encapsulates Frege's core idea that sentences can be understood as functions that assign truth or falsehood based on the properties of their arguments. It sets the stage for the rest of the text, which elaborates on this concept and applies it to more complex sentences.\n\n### 3.2 Quotation 2: Key Supporting Argument\n\n- **Quote:** \"Frege sees the occurrence of 'is taller than' in (BTM) 'Bill is taller than Mary' as being identical with the open sentence ‹x is taller than y›, and he sees that open sentence as expressing a function that assigns truth-values to ordered pairs of objects.\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears in the middle of the text, where the author expands Frege's approach to more complex sentences involving relations between objects.\n- **Significance:** This quotation illustrates how Frege's approach can be applied to sentences involving relations, showing that the same functional approach can be used to assign truth-values to ordered pairs of objects. It supports the main thesis by demonstrating the universality of Frege's method.\n\n### 3.3 Quotation 3: Crucial Definition or Conceptual Distinction\n\n- **Quote:** \"An atomic sentence is one that, unlike 'Bill is tall and Sally is smart,' doesn't consist of other sentences and that, unlike 'someone snores,' doesn't contain quantifiers.\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears towards the end of the text, where the author distinguishes between atomic and molecular sentences.\n- **Significance:** This quotation provides a crucial definition that is necessary for understanding the scope of Frege's analysis, which focuses on atomic sentences. It clarifies the distinction between atomic and molecular sentences, which is essential for the text's argument.\n\n### 3.4 Quotation 4: Position Being Criticized or Refuted\n\n- **Quote:** \"Pre-Fregean logicians saw each of PS, BTM, and BJMP as having a different form from each of the other two, and this made it impossible for them to do anything meaningful in the way of formalizing inferences involving atomic sentences.\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears towards the end of the text, where the author contrasts Frege's approach with that of pre-Fregean logicians.\n- **Significance:** This quotation highlights the limitations of pre-Fregean logic, which Frege's approach aims to overcome. It supports the main thesis by showing how Frege's method allows for a more unified and effective formalization of atomic sentences.\n\n### 3.5 Quotation 5: Methodological Statement\n\n- **Quote:** \"Frege was able to show that, ultimately, all atomic sentences have the form ‹O has psi.›\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears towards the end of the text, where the author summarizes Frege's achievement in formalizing atomic sentences.\n- **Significance:** This quotation encapsulates Frege's methodological approach, which involves reducing all atomic sentences to a single form. It supports the main thesis by demonstrating how Frege's method allows for a consistent and systematic analysis of atomic sentences.\n\n### 3.6 Quotation 6: Pivotal Turn in the Argument\n\n- **Quote:** \"Contrary to first appearances, BTM has the form: the ordered pair <Bill, Mary> has psi, where psi is the property had by such a pair just in case its first member is taller than its second.\"\n- **Location/Context:** This quotation appears in the middle of the text, where the author applies Frege's approach to the sentence \"Bill is taller than Mary.\"\n- **Significance:** This quotation represents a pivotal turn in the argument, as it shows how Frege's approach can be applied to sentences involving relations between objects. It demonstrates the flexibility and universality of Frege's method, supporting the main thesis.\n\n## SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL MOVES DEPLOYED\n\n### 4.1 Conceptual Analysis and Distinctions Drawn\n\n1. **Conceptual Analysis:** The text engages in conceptual analysis by breaking down the structure of sentences into their constituent parts and examining how these parts function to assign truth-values.\n   - **Example:** The text analyzes the sentence \"Plato snores\" into the open sentence ‹x snores›, which is seen as a function that assigns truth or falsehood based on whether the argument is a snorer.\n\n2. **Distinctions Drawn:** The text draws several important distinctions, such as between atomic and molecular sentences, and between the grammatical surface structure and the underlying logical structure of sentences.\n   - **Example:** The text distinguishes between atomic sentences, which do not consist of other sentences or contain quantifiers, and molecular sentences, which do. This distinction is crucial for understanding the scope of Frege's analysis.\n\n### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies\n\n1. **Reductio ad Absurdum:** The text uses a form of reductio ad absurdum to critique the pre-Fregean approach to logic, showing that it leads to the inability to formalize inferences involving atomic sentences.\n   - **Example:** The text argues that pre-Fregean logicians, by treating different types of atomic sentences as having different forms, were unable to do anything meaningful in the way of formalizing inferences involving atomic sentences.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens:** The text employs modus tollens to argue that if pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, then their approach must be flawed.\n   - **Example:** The text states that pre-Fregean logicians saw each of PS, BTM, and BJMP as having a different form, and this made it impossible for them to formalize inferences involving atomic sentences. This implies that their approach, which was based on grammatical surface structure, must be flawed.\n\n### 4.3 Category Error Detection\n\n1. **Category Error Detection:** The text detects a category error in the pre-Fregean approach to logic, which conflates the grammatical surface structure of sentences with their underlying logical structure.\n   - **Example:** The text argues that pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which led them to treat different types of atomic sentences as having different forms. This is presented as a category error, as the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form.\n\n### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning\n\n1. **Counterfactual Reasoning:** The text uses counterfactual reasoning to argue that if pre-Fregean logicians had adopted Frege's approach, they would have been able to formalize inferences involving atomic sentences more effectively.\n   - **Example:** The text implies that if pre-Fregean logicians had looked beyond the grammatical surface structure of sentences to their underlying logical structure, they would not have faced the same limitations in formalizing inferences.\n\n### 4.5 Thought Experiments\n\n1. **Thought Experiments:** The text uses thought experiments to illustrate how Frege's approach can be applied to different types of sentences, such as those involving relations between objects.\n   - **Example:** The text uses the example of \"Bill is taller than Mary\" to show how Frege's approach can be applied to sentences involving ordered pairs of objects, and the example of \"Bill is standing between Mary and John\" to show how it can be applied to sentences involving ordered triples of objects.\n\n### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons\n\n1. **Analogies and Comparisons:** The text uses analogies and comparisons to explain Frege's approach and to contrast it with the pre-Fregean approach to logic.\n   - **Example:** The text compares the open sentence ‹x is even› to the open sentence ‹x snores›, showing how both can be seen as functions that assign truth or falsehood based on the properties of their arguments. It also contrasts Frege's approach with that of pre-Fregean logicians, highlighting the advantages of the former.\n\n### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition\n\n1. **Appeals to Intuition:** The text appeals to the reader's intuition about the meaning of sentences and the assignment of truth-values to support Frege's approach.\n   - **Example:** The text states that \"2 is even\" is true and \"3 is even\" is false, appealing to the reader's intuition about the truth-values of these statements to support the idea that ‹x is even› can be seen as a function that assigns truth or falsehood based on whether the argument is an even number.\n\n### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation\n\n1. **Inference to Best Explanation:** The text uses inference to the best explanation to argue that Frege's approach provides the most effective way to formalize atomic sentences and overcome the limitations of pre-Fregean logic.\n   - **Example:** The text argues that Frege's approach, which treats all atomic sentences as having a unified form, provides the best explanation for how to formalize inferences involving atomic sentences, as it overcomes the limitations of the pre-Fregean approach.\n\n### 4.9 Transcendental Arguments\n\n1. **Transcendental Arguments:** The text uses a form of transcendental argument to argue that Frege's approach is necessary for the formalization of atomic sentences.\n   - **Example:** The text argues that Frege's approach, which looks beyond the grammatical surface structure of sentences to their underlying logical structure, is necessary for the formalization of atomic sentences, as it allows for a more unified and effective approach.\n\n### 4.10 Dialectical Moves\n\n1. **Dialectical Moves:** The text engages in dialectical moves by presenting Frege's approach and then contrasting it with the pre-Fregean approach to logic, showing the advantages of the former.\n   - **Example:** The text presents Frege's approach to treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values, and then contrasts it with the pre-Fregean approach, which was hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences. This dialectical move highlights the advantages of Frege's approach.\n\n### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies\n\n1. **Deconstructive Strategies:** The text uses deconstructive strategies to challenge the pre-Fregean approach to logic, showing how it is based on a flawed understanding of the relationship between the grammatical surface structure and the underlying logical structure of sentences.\n   - **Example:** The text deconstructs the pre-Fregean approach by showing how it treats different types of atomic sentences as having different forms based on their grammatical surface structure, and argues that this approach is flawed because it fails to recognize the underlying logical similarities between these sentences.\n\n### 4.12 Hermeneutical Approaches\n\n1. **Hermeneutical Approaches:** The text uses hermeneutical approaches to interpret and explain Frege's approach to language, showing how it can be applied to different types of sentences and how it overcomes the limitations of pre-Fregean logic.\n   - **Example:** The text interprets Frege's approach as treating all atomic sentences as having a unified form, ‹O has psi›, and explains how this approach can be applied to sentences like \"Plato snores,\" \"Bill is taller than Mary,\" and \"Bill is standing between Mary and John.\" This hermeneutical approach helps to clarify and elucidate Frege's method.\n\n## SECTION 5: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK & METHODOLOGY\n\n### 5.1 Philosophical or Theoretical Commitments\n\n1. **Commitment to Logical Analysis:** The text is committed to the idea that logical analysis is essential for understanding the structure and meaning of sentences, and that this analysis should focus on the underlying logical structure rather than the grammatical surface structure.\n\n2. **Commitment to Truth-Value Semantics:** The text is committed to the idea that the meaning of a sentence can be understood in terms of the truth-values it assigns to objects or sets of objects, and that this approach provides a clear and systematic way to evaluate the truth or falsehood of statements.\n\n### 5.2 Methodological Approach\n\n1. **Analytical Approach:** The text adopts an analytical approach, focusing on the logical analysis of sentences and the assignment of truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n2. **Formal Approach:** The text uses a formal approach, treating sentences as functions that can be represented using formal notation and analyzed using the tools of formal logic.\n\n### 5.3 Epistemological Assumptions\n\n1. **Objectivity of Truth-Values:** The text assumes that truth-values are objective and can be assigned based on the properties of objects or sets of objects, rather than being subjective or context-dependent.\n\n2. **Clarity and Precision in Analysis:** The text assumes that clarity and precision in logical analysis are essential for understanding the structure and meaning of sentences, and that this can be achieved through the use of formal notation and the tools of formal logic.\n\n### 5.4 Ontological Commitments\n\n1. **Commitment to Objects and Properties:** The text is committed to the idea that sentences refer to objects and properties, and that the truth or falsehood of a sentence depends on the properties of these objects.\n\n2. **Commitment to Functions:** The text is committed to the idea that sentences can be understood as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects, and that this functional approach provides a clear and systematic way to analyze the meaning of sentences.\n\n### 5.5 Use of Formal Logic or Informal Reasoning\n\n1. **Use of Formal Logic:** The text uses formal logic to represent sentences as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects, and to analyze the logical structure of these sentences.\n\n2. **Informal Reasoning:** The text also uses informal reasoning to explain and illustrate Frege's approach, using examples and analogies to make the concepts more accessible to the reader.\n\n### 5.6 Relationship to Empirical Evidence\n\n1. **Limited Use of Empirical Evidence:** The text does not rely heavily on empirical evidence, as its focus is on the logical analysis of sentences and the assignment of truth-values. However, it does use examples of sentences and their truth-values to illustrate and support its arguments.\n\n## SECTION 6: INTELLECTUAL GENEALOGY\n\n### 6.1 Thinkers and Theories Explicitly Referenced\n\n1. **Gottlob Frege:** The text explicitly references Frege and his approach to treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n### 6.2 Implicit Influences and Philosophical Heritage\n\n1. **Leibniz:** Frege's approach to logic and semantics can be seen as building on the work of Leibniz, who developed a system of symbolic logic and emphasized the importance of clarity and precision in philosophical analysis.\n\n2. **Kant:** Frege's focus on the underlying logical structure of sentences and his use of the concept of functions can be seen as influenced by Kant's emphasis on the role of the mind in structuring experience and his use of the concept of categories.\n\n### 6.3 Positions Being Argued Against\n\n1. **Pre-Fregean Logicians:** The text argues against the approach of pre-Fregean logicians, who treated different types of atomic sentences as having different forms based on their grammatical surface structure.\n\n### 6.4 Historical Debates the Text Engages With\n\n1. **Debate Over the Nature of Logic:** The text engages with the historical debate over the nature of logic, particularly the question of whether logic should focus on the grammatical surface structure of sentences or their underlying logical structure.\n\n2. **Debate Over the Nature of Meaning:** The text also engages with the historical debate over the nature of meaning, particularly the question of whether the meaning of a sentence can be understood in terms of the truth-values it assigns to objects or sets of objects.\n\n### 6.5 Canonical Texts or Ideas Invoked\n\n1. **Frege's \"Begriffsschrift\":** The text invokes Frege's \"Begriffsschrift,\" which introduced the concept of treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n2. **Frege's \"Sense and Reference\":** The text also invokes Frege's \"Sense and Reference,\" which introduced the distinction between the sense and reference of a term and laid the groundwork for his approach to semantics.\n\n## SECTION 7: CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS\n\n### 7.1 Key Terms and Their Definitions\n\n1. **Atomic Sentence:** An atomic sentence is defined as a sentence that does not consist of other sentences and does not contain quantifiers. Examples include \"Plato snores,\" \"Bill is taller than Mary,\" and \"Bill is standing between Mary and John.\"\n\n2. **Molecular Sentence:** A molecular sentence is defined as a sentence that either consists of other sentences or contains a quantifier. Examples include \"Bill is tall and Sally is smart\" and \"someone snores.\"\n\n3. **Open Sentence:** An open sentence is defined as a sentence with a variable that can be replaced with an expression to form a true or false statement. Examples include ‹x snores›, ‹x is taller than y›, and ‹x is standing between y and z›.\n\n4. **Function:** A function is defined as a rule that assigns truth-values to objects or sets of objects based on their properties. For example, the open sentence ‹x snores› is seen as a function that assigns truth to each snorer and falsehood to each thing that doesn't snore.\n\n5. **Truth-Value:** A truth-value is defined as either true or false, which can be assigned to a sentence based on the properties of its arguments.\n\n### 7.2 Technical Vocabulary Introduced or Employed\n\n1. **Ordered Pair:** An ordered pair is a set of two objects in which the order of the objects matters. For example, the ordered pair <Bill, Mary> is used to represent the sentence \"Bill is taller than Mary.\"\n\n2. **Ordered Triple:** An ordered triple is a set of three objects in which the order of the objects matters. For example, the ordered triple <Bill, Mary, John> is used to represent the sentence \"Bill is standing between Mary and John.\"\n\n### 7.3 Distinctions Drawn Between Related Concepts\n\n1. **Atomic vs. Molecular Sentences:** The text distinguishes between atomic sentences, which do not consist of other sentences or contain quantifiers, and molecular sentences, which do.\n\n2. **Grammatical Surface Structure vs. Underlying Logical Structure:** The text distinguishes between the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which can vary, and their underlying logical structure, which is more fundamental and can be represented using a unified form.\n\n### 7.4 Theoretical Innovations or Neologisms\n\n1. **Unified Form of Atomic Sentences:** The text introduces the idea that all atomic sentences can be represented using a unified form, ‹O has psi›, where O is an object or set of objects, and psi is a property or relation.\n\n### 7.5 Repurposing of Existing Concepts\n\n1. **Function:** The text repurposes the mathematical concept of a function to apply it to the analysis of sentences, treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE\n\n### 8.1 Overall Organization of the Argument\n\n1. **Introduction of Frege's Approach:** The text begins by introducing Frege's method of treating sentences as functions that assign truth-values, using the example of \"Plato snores\" to illustrate the concept of an open sentence.\n\n2. **Expansion to More Complex Sentences:** The text then expands this approach to more complex sentences, such as \"Bill is taller than Mary\" and \"Bill is standing between Mary and John,\" showing how these can also be represented as functions that assign truth-values to ordered pairs or triples of objects.\n\n3. **Comparison with Pre-Fregean Logic:** The text contrasts Frege's approach with that of pre-Fregean logicians, highlighting how the latter were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Unified Form of Atomic Sentences:** The text concludes by emphasizing that Frege's approach allows for a unified form for all atomic sentences, ‹O has psi›, which overcomes the limitations of pre-Fregean logic and enables more effective formalization of inferences.\n\n### 8.2 Logical Dependencies Between Claims\n\n1. **Claim 1:** All atomic sentences can be represented as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the idea that sentences can be analyzed into their constituent parts and that these parts can be seen as functions that assign truth or falsehood based on the properties of their arguments.\n\n2. **Claim 2:** Pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which led them to treat different types of atomic sentences as having different forms.\n   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the idea that the grammatical surface structure of sentences can vary, and that pre-Fregean logicians focused on this surface structure rather than the underlying logical structure.\n\n3. **Claim 3:** Frege's method looks beyond surface grammar to the underlying logical structure of sentences.\n   - **Dependency:** This claim depends on the idea that the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form, and that understanding this logical structure is essential for formalizing inferences.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Frege's approach allows for a more unified and effective formalization of atomic sentences, overcoming the limitations of pre-Fregean logic.\n   - **Dependency:** This conclusion depends on all of the above claims, as it argues that Frege's approach, which focuses on the underlying logical structure of sentences, overcomes the limitations of the pre-Fregean approach, which focused on the grammatical surface structure.\n\n### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions\n\n1. **Premise 1:** All atomic sentences can be represented as functions that assign truth-values to objects or sets of objects.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Pre-Fregean logicians were hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences, which led them to treat different types of atomic sentences as having different forms.\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Frege's method looks beyond surface grammar to the underlying logical structure of sentences.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Frege's approach allows for a more unified and effective formalization of atomic sentences, overcoming the limitations of pre-Fregean logic.\n\n### 8.4 Use of Examples, Illustrations, or Case Studies\n\n1. **Example 1:** \"Plato snores\" is used as an example of an atomic sentence that can be represented as the open sentence ‹x snores›, which is seen as a function that assigns truth to each snorer and falsehood to each thing that doesn't snore.\n\n2. **Example 2:** \"Bill is taller than Mary\" is used as an example of an atomic sentence that can be represented as the open sentence ‹x is taller than y›, which is seen as a function that assigns truth to the ordered pair <x, y> if x is taller than y and otherwise assigns falsehood to that pair.\n\n3. **Example 3:** \"Bill is standing between Mary and John\" is used as an example of an atomic sentence that can be represented as the open sentence ‹x is standing between y and z›, which is seen as a function that assigns truth to the ordered triple <x, y, z> if x is standing between y and z and otherwise assigns falsehood to that triple.\n\n### 8.5 Anticipation and Response to Objections\n\n1. **Objection 1:** Some might object that Frege's approach is too abstract and removed from the actual use of language.\n   - **Response:** The text could respond by arguing that Frege's approach is not meant to replace the actual use of language, but rather to provide a systematic way to analyze the logical structure of sentences and formalize inferences.\n\n2. **Objection 2:** Some might object that Frege's approach cannot account for the nuances and complexities of natural language.\n   - **Response:** The text could respond by arguing that Frege's approach is focused on the logical structure of sentences, and that while it may not capture all the nuances of natural language, it provides a clear and systematic way to analyze the truth-values of sentences.\n\n### 8.6 Dialectical Structure\n\n1. **Thesis:** Frege's approach to language treats all atomic sentences as having a unified form, where each sentence can be represented as a function that assigns truth-values to objects or ordered sets of objects.\n\n2. **Antithesis:** Pre-Fregean logicians treated different types of atomic sentences as having different forms based on their grammatical surface structure, which made it impossible for them to formalize inferences involving atomic sentences effectively.\n\n3. **Synthesis:** Frege's approach, by looking beyond the grammatical surface structure to the underlying logical structure of sentences, overcomes the limitations of the pre-Fregean approach and allows for a more unified and effective formalization of atomic sentences.\n\n## SECTION 9: CRITICAL EVALUATION INDICATORS\n\n### 9.1 Strengths of the Argument\n\n1. **Clarity and Precision:** The text's argument is clear and precise, using formal notation

structure of sentences, showing how all atomic sentences can be represented using a unified form.\n\n3. **Overcoming Limitations:** The text effectively shows how Frege's approach overcomes the limitations of pre-Fregean logic, which was hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences.\n\n### 9.2 Potential Weaknesses or Gaps\n\n1. **Limited Scope:** The text focuses on atomic sentences and does not address how Frege's approach can be extended to molecular sentences, which may limit its applicability to more complex forms of language.\n\n2. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The text does not provide empirical evidence to support its claims, relying instead on logical analysis and examples, which may weaken its persuasiveness for some readers.\n\n3. **Neglect of Nuances:** The text's focus on the logical structure of sentences may neglect the nuances and complexities of natural language, which could be seen as a weakness by those who emphasize the importance of context and pragmatics in understanding meaning.\n\n### 9.3 Unstated Assumptions that Could be Challenged\n\n1. **Assumption of Objectivity:** The text assumes that truth-values are objective and can be assigned based on the properties of objects or sets of objects, which could be challenged by those who argue that truth-values are subjective or context-dependent.\n\n2. **Assumption of Universality:** The text assumes that Frege's approach is universally applicable to all atomic sentences, which could be challenged by those who argue that different types of sentences may require different approaches to analysis.\n\n3. **Assumption of Logical Structure:** The text assumes that the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form, which could be challenged by those who argue that the grammatical form of sentences is essential for understanding their meaning.\n\n### 9.4 Alternative Interpretations or Objections Not Addressed\n\n1. **Alternative Interpretation:** Some might argue that Frege's approach is not the only way to formalize atomic sentences, and that other approaches, such as those based on model theory or proof theory, could be equally effective.\n\n2. **Objection Not Addressed:** The text does not address the objection that Frege's approach may not be able to account for the nuances and complexities of natural language, such as ambiguity, context-sensitivity, and pragmatic factors.\n\n### 9.5 Scope and Limitations of the Claims\n\n1. **Scope:** The text's claims are limited to atomic sentences and do not extend to molecular sentences, which may limit their applicability to more complex forms of language.\n\n2. **Limitations:** The text's focus on the logical structure of sentences may neglect

have practical applications in fields such as computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\n2. **Clarity in Philosophical Analysis:** The text's argument suggests that Frege's approach can provide greater clarity and precision in philosophical analysis, particularly in the philosophy of language and logic.\n\n### 10.3 What Follows if the Thesis is Correct\n\n1. **Unified Formalization:** If the thesis is correct, then all atomic sentences can be formalized using a unified form, ‹O has psi›, which would provide a systematic way to analyze the logical structure of sentences.\n\n2. **Overcoming Pre-Fregean Limitations:** If the thesis is correct, then Frege's approach would overcome the limitations of pre-Fregean logic, which was hindered by the grammatical surface structure of sentences.\n\n3. **Foundation for Further Developments:** If the thesis is correct, then Frege's approach would provide a foundation for further developments in formal semantics and logical analysis, which could lead to new insights and applications.\n\n### 10.4 What's at Stake in Accepting or Rejecting the Position\n\n1. **Accepting the Position:** Accepting the position would mean accepting that the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form, and that understanding this logical structure is essential for formalizing inferences. It would also mean accepting that all atomic sentences can be represented using a unified form, which could have implications for the philosophy of language and logic.\n\n2. **Rejecting the Position:** Rejecting the position would mean rejecting the idea that the logical structure of sentences is more fundamental than their grammatical form, and that understanding this logical structure is essential for formalizing inferences.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also argues that the relationship between a sentence and its meaning is conventional and not purely causal, distinguishing it from natural signs like smoke and fire.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument 1: Distinction Between Linguistic and Psychological Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the meaning of a sentence (linguistic meaning) is not identical to what a speaker means by uttering that sentence (psychological meaning). This is supported by the example of the sentence "snow is white," where the linguistic meaning is fixed by convention, while the psychological meaning can vary based on the speaker's intentions.
2. **Argument 2: Psychological Meaning Depends on Linguistic Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that for a speaker to convey a psychological meaning, they must first understand the linguistic meaning of the sentence they are using. This is illustrated by the example where a speaker cannot sincerely and literally convey that snow is white if they believe the sentence "snow is white" means something else.

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text can be articulated in multiple formulations due to its complexity:

1. **Primary Formulation**: The text argues that sentences are structurally isomorphic to propositions, which are digital structures composed of discrete parts, and that the study of language can be divided into three branches: semantics, syntax, and pragmatics.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text posits that the meaning of a sentence is a proposition, which is distinct from the sentence itself but structurally similar, and that language use involves both literal and non-literal meanings, which are studied by semantics and pragmatics, respectively.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Sentences as Proposition-Isomorphs**:
   - The text argues that sentences express propositions, which are not themselves sentences but are structurally similar to them. This is supported by the example of different sentences expressing the same proposition, such as "schnee ist weiss" and "snow is white."
   - The argument is further developed by discussing how sentences like "John loves Mary" and "Sally punched John" share the word "John," indicating that propositions have discrete parts that correspond to parts of sentences.

2. **Propositions as Digital Structures**:
   - The text asserts that propositions, like sentences, are digital structures composed of discrete, isolable entities. This is contrasted with visual perceptions, which are analog structures.
   - The argument is supported by the example of the sentence "Sally punched Bob," which can be decomposed into minimal units of significance (morphemes), suggesting that propositions have a similar structure.

3. **Three Branches of the Philosophy of Language**:
   - The text divides the study of language into semantics, syntax, and pragmatics, each focusing on different aspects of language: literal meaning, structure of complex expressions, and use of language, respectively.
   - Each branch is exemplified: semantics with the literal meaning of a boss's statement, pragmatics with the non-literal use of language, and syntax with the structure of complex expressions like "the man who ate my cookie."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **The Absolute as a Sentence-Imposter**:
   - The text claims that "the absolute is one" is not a sentence but a sentence-imposter because the word "absolute" in this context is a mere homonym and lacks semantic assignment.
   - This argument is used to illustrate the importance of semantic rules in determining whether an expression is a linguistic expression.

2. **Propositions and Truths**:
   - The text asserts that propositions, when true, are truths and have existed as long as there have been truths, implying that propositions are not human creations.
   - This claim supports the idea that propositions are fundamental to understanding the nature of language and reality.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Semantic Realism**: The text assumes a form of semantic realism, where propositions exist independently of human language and are the bearers of truth values.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text can be articulated in multiple formulations due to its complexity:

1. **Primary Formulation**: The meaning of complex expressions in language is determined by the semantic structures of their constituent parts, and understanding these structures requires the discipline of semantics.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The literal meaning of a sentence can be distinguished from what a speaker intends to convey, and semantics is essential for clarifying the structure of literal meaning, especially in cases where this distinction is not immediately clear.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Semantic Structure of Complex Expressions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the meanings of complex expressions are derived from the meanings of their simpler components. For example, the sentence "Sally hates Bob" is analyzed in terms of the meanings of "Sally," "hates," and "Bob." This argument is supported by the assertion that the relationship between the meaning of "Sally hates Bob" and "hates" is identical to that between "Larry loves Julie" and "loves."
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples of sentences and their constituent parts to illustrate how the meanings of complex expressions are built from simpler ones. It states, "The discipline of syntax studies the relation that the meanings of complex expressions bear to the meanings of the simple expressions composing them."

2. **Argument 2: Need for Semantics to Clarify Metaknowledge**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that while speakers may understand the meaning of a sentence like "John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass," they do not necessarily know what it is that they know. Semantics is needed to provide this metaknowledge, which involves understanding the structure of the meaning.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses the example of "John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass" to show that the sentence does not refer to a specific fish but to a proposition about a property. It states, "Semanticists supply us with the missing metaknowledge," and provides a detailed analysis of the sentence's meaning.

3. **Argument 3: Distinction Between Literal and Non-Literal Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that semantics is necessary to distinguish between what is literally meant by an utterance and what the speaker intends to convey. This distinction is crucial in cases where the literal meaning is not immediately clear.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples of utterances where the literal meaning is clear (e.g., "the cops are coming") and others where it is not (e.g., "that man is a thief"). It states, "First of all, we must distinguish what is literally meant by an utterance from what it is that the speaker wishes to convey."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Syntax Studies Semantic Structure**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that syntax, while not directly studying the meanings of complex expressions, examines the structures of those meanings. This claim supports the primary argument about the importance of understanding semantic structures.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "Syntax doesn't study the semantics (meanings) of complex expressions. It studies the structures of the semantics of complex expressions. Syntax studies semantic structure."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Propositions and Properties in Sentence Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that sentences like "John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass" do not refer to specific entities but to propositions and properties. This claim supports the need for semantics to clarify the structure of meaning.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides a detailed analysis of the sentence, showing that it refers to a proposition about a property rather than a specific fish. It states, "(1) doesn't describe a relationship between John and some non-existent or quasi-existent fish. It affirms the existence of a relationship between John and a proposition."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Compositionality of Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that the meaning of a complex expression is composed of the meanings of its parts. This assumption underlies the argument about the semantic structure of complex expressions.

2. **Assumption 2: Distinction Between Knowledge and Metaknowledge**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that understanding a sentence's meaning is different from understanding the structure of that meaning. This assumption supports the argument about the need for semantics to provide metaknowledge.

3. **Assumption 3: Importance of Literal Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that distinguishing between literal and non-literal meaning is crucial for understanding language. This assumption underlies the argument about the role of semantics in clarifying literal meaning.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument follows a logical structure that can be outlined as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: The meanings of complex expressions are derived from the meanings of their simpler components.
2. **Premise 2**: Understanding the structure of these meanings requires the discipline of semantics.
3. **Premise 3**: Semantics is necessary to clarify the metaknowledge involved in understanding sentences.
4. **Premise 4**: There is a distinction between what is literally meant by an utterance and what the speaker intends to convey.
5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, semantics is essential for understanding the structure of meaning in language, particularly in distinguishing literal from non-literal meaning.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

The text's argument progresses through several stages:

1. **Introduction of Key Concepts**: The text begins by introducing the concepts of syntax and semantics, explaining how syntax studies the structures of meanings rather than the meanings themselves.

2. **Example Analysis**: It then provides examples of sentences ("Sally hates Bob," "Larry loves Julie") to illustrate how the meanings of complex expressions are derived from their parts.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the literal meaning of utterances can be obscured by the pre-semantic information through which they are grasped, necessitating the intervention of professional semanticists to uncover the true meaning.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument from Different Descriptions**: The text argues that the same literal meaning can be grasped through different perceptual descriptions, leading to a lack of awareness that the same meaning is being affirmed. For example, the utterances U1 and U2 both mean "x is a thief," but the speaker does not realize this because they are based on different visual descriptions of Steve.

   - **Explanation**: The text illustrates this with the example of Steve, who is described differently in two scenarios (wearing a ski-mask and running off vs. being a portly amicable fellow sitting in a chair). Despite the different descriptions, the literal meaning of both utterances is the same, but the speaker does not recognize this due to the different perceptual information.

2. **Argument from Contextual Relativity**: The text argues that the meaning of degree properties like "smart" is contextually relative, and this relativity can obscure the literal meaning of sentences.

   - **Explanation**: The example of Fido and Timmy being described as "smart" is used to show that the property of being smart is relative to a benchmark (smart for a dog vs. smart for a human). This relativity means that the literal meaning of "smart" in different contexts can be different, requiring semantic analysis to clarify.

3. **Argument from Semantic Rules**: The text argues that languages are sets of semantic rules that systematically pair sentences with meanings, and understanding these rules is crucial for uncovering literal meanings.

   - **Explanation**: The text explains that the English language assigns meanings to sentences and sentences to meanings through semantic rules. This systematic pairing is essential for understanding how literal meanings are determined and can be obscured by pre-semantic information.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim on Ambiguity**: The text addresses the claim that words like "smart" might be ambiguous, but rejects this as a solution to the problem of contextual relativity.

   - **Explanation**: The text argues that treating "smart" as ambiguous (like "dumb") is not a plausible solution because it does not account for the contextual relativity of degree properties.

2. **Subsidiary Claim on Implicit Relationality**: The text suggests that degree properties like "smart" are implicitly relational, meaning they are understood relative to a contextually determined benchmark.

   - **Explanation**: This claim is supported by the example of Fido being smart relative to other dogs, and Timmy being smart relative to other humans. The text argues that this implicit relationality affects the literal meaning of sentences.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption of Perceptual Influence**: The text assumes that perceptual information significantly influences the understanding of literal meaning, which is why different descriptions can lead to different interpretations of the same utterance.

2. **Assumption of Contextual Importance**: The text assumes that context plays a crucial role in determining the meaning of degree properties, which is why the same word can have different meanings in different contexts.

3. **Assumption of Semantic Complexity**: The text assumes that the literal meanings of sentences are often complex and obscured, requiring specialized knowledge to uncover them.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument follows a deductive structure, moving from specific examples to general conclusions about the nature of literal meaning and the role of semantics:

1. **Premise 1**: Different perceptual descriptions can lead to the same literal meaning being grasped differently (illustrated by the Steve example).
2. **Premise 2**: Degree properties like "smart" are contextually relative and can have different meanings in different contexts (illustrated by the Fido and Timmy example).
3. **Premise 3**: Languages are sets of semantic rules that systematically pair sentences with meanings (general statement about language).
4. **Conclusion**: The literal meaning of utterances can be obscured by pre-semantic information, necessitating the intervention of professional semanticists to uncover the true meaning.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

## SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL MOVES DEPLOYED

### 4.1 Conceptual Analysis and Distinctions Drawn

1. **Literal Meaning vs. Perceptual Description**: The text draws a distinction between the literal meaning of an utterance and the perceptual description through which it is grasped. This distinction is crucial for understanding how the same literal meaning can be affirmed without the speaker realizing it.

   - **Explanation**: The text uses the examples of U1 and U2 to illustrate this distinction. U1 and U2 both have the literal meaning "x is a thief," but they are based on different perceptual descriptions of Steve (wearing a ski-mask vs. being a portly amicable fellow).

2. **Degree Properties and Contextual Relativity**: The text analyzes the concept of degree properties like "smart" and argues that their meanings are contextually relative. This analysis is used to explain why the same word can have different meanings in different contexts.

   - **Explanation**: The text uses the example of Fido and Timmy being described as "smart" to illustrate how the property of being smart is relative to a benchmark (smart for a dog vs. smart for a human). This relativity means that the literal meaning of "smart" in different contexts can be different.

### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies

1. **Reductio ad Absurdum**: The text uses a reductio ad absurdum argument to reject the solution of treating words like "smart" as ambiguous.

   - **Explanation**: The text argues that if "smart" were ambiguous like "dumb," then "Timmy is smart" and "Fido is smart" would have different meanings. However, this leads to the absurd conclusion that "Timmy is smart" must be true if "Fido is smart" is true, which is not the case. Therefore, the text concludes that "smart" is not ambiguous.

2. **Modus Tollens**: The text uses a modus tollens argument to support the claim that degree properties are implicitly relational.

   - **Explanation**: The text argues that if degree properties were not implicitly relational, then the same word would have the same meaning in different contexts. However, this is not the case (as shown by the Fido and Timmy example). Therefore, the text concludes that degree properties must be implicitly relational.

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

1. **Category Error in Ambiguity**: The text detects a category error in the solution of treating words like "smart" as ambiguous.

   - **Explanation**: The text argues that treating "smart" as ambiguous is a category error because it does not account for the contextual relativity of degree properties.

This experiment is used to show how the same literal meaning can be affirmed without the speaker realizing it due to different perceptual descriptions.

2. **Thought Experiment with Fido and Timmy**: The text uses a thought experiment involving Fido and Timmy to illustrate the contextual relativity of degree properties.

   - **Explanation**: The thought experiment involves describing Fido and Timmy as "smart" in different contexts (smart for a dog vs. smart for a human). This experiment is used to show how the same word can have different meanings in different contexts due to contextual relativity.

### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons

1. **Analogy with "Dumb"**: The text uses an analogy with the word "dumb" to illustrate the implausibility of treating "smart" as ambiguous.

   - **Explanation**: The text compares the word "smart" to the word "dumb," which can mean both "unintelligent" and "mute." This analogy is used to show that treating "smart" as ambiguous (like "dumb") is not a plausible solution to the problem of contextual relativity.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects rather than to expressions, and that these rules are not mathematical functions in the strict logical sense.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Meaning Requires Animate Beings**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that something becomes an expression only when it is endowed with meaning by animate beings. This is supported by the example of a twig deposit forming the shape of "1 + 1 = 2," which would not be an expression in a world without animate beings.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it. In a world where there were no animate beings, but in which the forthcoming parenthetical ink deposit (1 + 1 = 2) was formed out of twigs, that twig deposit wouldn't be an expression of any kind."

2. **Argument 2: Semantic Rules Assign Meanings to Non-Expressions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that semantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions, specifically to properties of physical objects. This is illustrated by the example of creating a code name for Larry, where the semantic rule assigns the meaning "Larry" to the property of certain bursts of noise.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "Thus, semantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions. But which non-expressions? A story will give us the answer."

3. **Argument 3: Semantic Rules Are Not Mathematical Functions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that semantic rules are not mathematical functions in the strict logical sense. This is supported by the critique of the function-theoretic view, which posits that semantic rules are mathematical functions that assign meanings to expressions.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "The just-described view is false. The rule denoted by '+' has always existed and always will. Of course, the expression '+' hasn't always existed. But that's irrelevant, since things pre-exist the expressions we use to denote them."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Expressions Already Have Meanings**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that expressions already have meanings and do not need to be assigned them. This is supported by the argument that something becomes an expression only when it is endowed with meaning.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "Thus, expressions aren't assigned meanings. They already have them and don't need to be assigned them."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Semantic Rules Assign Meanings to Properties**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects, specifically morphological or acoustical properties. This is supported by the example of assigning the meaning "Larry" to the property of certain bursts of noise.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

1. Core thesis statement:
   1.1. The core thesis of the text is that semantic rules are not mathematical functions and cannot be understood solely in terms of speaker's meaning, as proposed by Grice and his followers.
   1.2. Instead, semantic rules are normative and compositional, determined by the meanings of their parts and their syntactic arrangement.

2. Primary arguments supporting the thesis:
   2.1. Semantic rules are not mathematical functions:
      2.1.1. Semantic rules have not always existed, unlike mathematical functions which are timeless.
      2.1.2. If semantic rules were mathematical functions, there would exist languages where terms like "Socrates" refer to Lincoln and "snow is white" means all horses weigh 18,000 lbs, which is not the case.
   2.2. Grice's theory of meaning as speaker's meaning is inadequate:
      2.2.1. Literal meaning cannot be reduced to what speakers mean when they utter an expression.
      2.2.2. The meaning of subsentential expressions like "or" cannot be captured by speaker's meaning alone.
      2.2.3. The meaning of sentences is compositional, determined by the meanings of their parts and their syntactic arrangement, not by speaker's intentions.
      2.2.4. Grice's theory fails to account for the normative nature of semantic rules, which dictate what is correct or incorrect in language use.

3. Secondary arguments and subsidiary claims:
   3.1. Wittgenstein's view that "meaning is use" is also inadequate, as it fails to capture the distinction between literal meaning and speaker's meaning.
   3.2. Neo-Gricean attempts to salvage Grice's theory by positing indirect determination of meaning by speaker's intentions are also flawed.

4. Implicit assumptions underlying the arguments:
   4.1. There is a clear distinction between literal meaning and speaker's meaning.
   4.2. Semantic rules are normative, prescribing what is correct or incorrect in language use.
   4.3. The meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its parts and their syntactic arrangement.

5. Logical structure of the overall argument:
   5.1. The text begins by establishing that semantic rules are not mathematical functions, using a reductio ad absurdum argument.
   5.2. It then critiques Grice's theory of meaning as speaker's meaning, using counterexamples and logical analysis to show its inadequacies.
   5.3. The text further refutes neo-Gricean attempts to modify Grice's theory, demonstrating their failure to account for the compositional and normative nature of semantic rules.

6. Argument progression and development throughout the text:
   6.1. The text starts with a broad critique of semantic rules as mathematical functions, setting the stage for a more focused critique of Grice's theory.
   6.2. It then systematically addresses different aspects of Grice's theory, from its inability to account for subsentential meaning to its failure to recognize the compositional nature of meaning.
   6.3. The text concludes by emphasizing the normative nature of semantic rules, which is incompatible with Grice's view of meaning as speaker's intention.

SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS

1. "rules, those semantic rules haven't always existed. Therefore, they haven't always existed. They came into existence quite recently. Therefore, those rules aren't mathematical functions."
   - Location/Context: Opening of the text, establishing the non-mathematical nature of semantic rules.
   - Significance: This quote sets up the initial argument that semantic rules are not timeless like mathematical functions, which is crucial for the overall thesis.

2. "Also, if the semantic rules of English were such functions, there would exist a language in which 'Socrates' referred to Lincoln and in which 'snow is white' meant all horses weigh 18,000 lbs, the reason being that the corresponding mathematical functions exist. But there is no such language."
   - Location/Context: Early in the text, as part of the argument against semantic rules as mathematical functions.
   - Significance: This quote uses a reductio ad absurdum to illustrate the implausibility of semantic rules as mathematical functions, reinforcing the initial argument.

3. "Understandably, many philosophers of language believe that semantic rules must be understood in psychological, not mathematical, terms."
   - Location/Context: Transition to the discussion of the Gricean approach.
   - Significance: This quote introduces the shift in focus from mathematical to psychological theories of meaning, setting up the critique of Grice's theory.

4. "According to Grice (1957), for expression E to have literal meaning M is for it to be the case that, when they utter E, M is what they mean."
   - Location/Context: Explanation of Grice's theory of meaning.
   - Significance: This quote provides a clear statement of Grice's position, which is the primary target of the text's critique.

5. "So 'snow is white' has the proposition snow is white for its literal meaning because what people generally mean when they say 'snow is white' is that snow is white."
   - Location/Context: Elaboration on Grice's theory using an example.
   - Significance: This quote illustrates how Grice's theory applies to specific cases, making the critique more concrete.

6. "Literal meaning is to be understood in terms of speaker's meaning. That's the main idea."
   - Location/Context: Summary of Grice's core idea.
   - Significance: This quote encapsulates the central claim of Grice's theory, which the text aims to refute.

7. "Wittgenstein (1958) advocated a version of this view. 'Roughly speaking,' he said, 'meaning is use.'"
   - Location/Context: Discussion of Wittgenstein's view on meaning.
   - Significance: This quote introduces Wittgenstein's perspective, which the text also critiques, broadening the scope of the argument.

8. "But whatever it is that 'or' means, it cannot, at least not by itself, be what a person means."
   - Location/Context: Critique of Grice's theory in relation to subsentential expressions.
   - Significance: This quote highlights a specific weakness in Grice's theory, showing its inability to account for the meaning of individual words.

9. "If Grice were right, the meaning of the sentence: (SF) 'Smith is now living in France' would be fixed by the intentions people have in using it. But its meaning is not fixed by those intentions."
   - Location/Context: Critique of Grice's theory in relation to sentence meaning.
   - Significance: This quote uses a specific example to illustrate the compositional nature of meaning, which Grice's theory cannot accommodate.

10. "Unlike scientific laws, semantic rules are normative. If, intending to affirm that Smith is female, you say 'Smith is male,' you've done something wrong."
    - Location/Context: Discussion of the normative nature of semantic rules.
    - Significance: This quote emphasizes the key distinction between semantic rules and scientific laws, which is crucial for the text's argument against Grice's theory.

   2.2. Modus tollens: The text employs this strategy to refute Grice's theory, arguing that if Grice were right, certain consequences would follow that are not the case.
      - Example: "If Grice were right, the meaning of the sentence: (SF) 'Smith is now living in France' would be fixed by the intentions people have in using it. But its meaning is not fixed by those intentions."

3. Category error detection:
   3.1. The text identifies a category error in Grice's theory, arguing that it conflates the psychological act of meaning something with the semantic property of having a meaning.

   7.2. It also appeals to the intuition that semantic rules are normative, prescribing what is correct or incorrect in language use.

8. Inference to best explanation:
   8.1. The text argues that the best explanation for the meaning of sentences is their compositional nature, determined by the meanings of their parts and their syntactic arrangement.
   8.2. It also suggests that the best explanation for the normative nature of semantic rules is that they prescribe what is correct or incorrect in language use, rather than merely describing what speakers mean.

9. Transcendental arguments:
   9.1. The text employs a transcendental argument to establish the necessity of semantic rules being normative, arguing that without this feature, language use could not be evaluated as correct or incorrect.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## SECTION 1: DOMAIN & DISCIPLINARY CONTEXT

### 1.1 Primary Academic Domain(s) and Subdomain(s)

The text primarily falls within the domain of philosophy, specifically within the subdomain of philosophy of language. It engages deeply with semantic theory, which is a central concern in the philosophy of language, focusing on the nature and function of meaning in language.

### 1.2 Interdisciplinary Connections and Influences

While the text is firmly rooted in philosophy, it also touches on linguistics, particularly in its discussion of semantic rules and their relation to speaker behavior. Additionally, there are connections to cognitive science, as the text considers the psychological reality of semantic rules and their role in guiding speech acts.

### 1.3 Historical Positioning Within the Field

The text positions itself within ongoing debates in the philosophy of language that have been prominent since the early 20th century, particularly those influenced by the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the subsequent development of semantic theories. It engages with contemporary discussions around semantic rules, conceptual role semantics, and the nature of meaning.

### 1.4 Relationship to Major Schools of Thought

The text aligns itself with a critical stance towards certain schools of thought within the philosophy of language, particularly those advocating for semantic rules as mere descriptions of speaker behavior (e.g., Nathan Salmon and Scott Soames) and conceptual role semantics (e.g., Hartry Field and Robert Brandom). It positions itself in opposition to these views, suggesting a more normative and psychologically active role for semantic rules.

### 1.5 Target Audience and Scholarly Community

The target audience for this text is primarily scholars and students within the philosophy of language and related fields such as linguistics and cognitive science. It is written at a level that assumes familiarity with key concepts and debates within these areas, making it suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students and professional academics.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that semantic rules are not merely idealized descriptions of speaker behavior but are normative and psychologically active, guiding speech acts. Additionally, the text argues against conceptual role semantics, asserting that meaning cannot be constituted by use alone.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Semantic Rules as Normative and Psychologically Active**
   - The text argues that semantic rules guide speech acts, as evidenced by the example of choosing the sentence "Smith is now living in France" to convey a specific belief. This choice is guided by knowledge of semantic rules, suggesting that these rules are not merely descriptive but normative and psychologically real.

2. **Critique of Semantic Rules as Descriptions of Speaker Behavior**
   - The text criticizes the view held by Nathan Salmon and Scott Soames that semantic rules are idealized descriptions of speaker behavior. It argues that if semantic rules were merely descriptive, they would be psychologically inert and unable to guide speech acts, which contradicts the normative nature of semantic rules.

3. **Incoherence of Conceptual Role Semantics (CRS)**
   - The text argues that CRS, which posits that meaning is determined by use, is incoherent. It contends that expressions must have meaning before they can be used, and thus, use cannot determine meaning. This argument is supported by the distinction between causal determination and identity of meaning and use.

4. **Critique of CRS's View on Inference and Meaning**
   - The text criticizes CRS's claim that a sentence's meaning is determined by what people infer from it. It argues that changes in beliefs affect inferences but not the meanings of sentences, using the example of learning that Aristotle wrote plays to illustrate this point.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

- **Normative Character of Semantic Rules**
  - The text asserts that semantic rules have a normative character, meaning that speaker behavior is answerable to these rules. This is a subsidiary claim supporting the primary argument that semantic rules are not merely descriptive.

- **Distinction Between Meaning and Use**
  - The text draws a clear distinction between meaning and use, arguing that while use can assign new meanings to expressions, it cannot constitute the meaning of an expression. This supports the critique of CRS.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

- **Psychological Reality of Semantic Rules**
  - The text assumes that semantic rules have a psychological reality, meaning that speakers are aware of and guided by these rules when they speak.

- **Normativity of Language**
  - There is an implicit assumption that language is normative, meaning that there are correct and incorrect ways to use language, which are governed by semantic rules.

- **Priority of Meaning Over Use**
  - The text assumes that meaning precedes use, which is crucial for its critique of CRS and its argument that use cannot determine meaning.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction of the Problematic View**
   - The text begins by presenting the view that semantic rules are idealized descriptions of speaker behavior, which it will critique.

2. **Critique of the Problematic View**
   - It then critiques this view, arguing that semantic rules must be normative and psychologically active to guide speech acts.

3. **Introduction of Conceptual Role Semantics**
   - The text introduces CRS as another problematic view, which it will also critique.

4. **Critique of Conceptual Role Semantics**
   - It then critiques CRS, arguing that meaning cannot be constituted by use and that inferences do not determine meaning.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The text concludes by reinforcing its thesis that semantic rules are normative and psychologically active, and that meaning cannot be reduced to use.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

The argument progresses from a critique of the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive to a critique of CRS. It begins with a specific example of how semantic rules guide speech acts, then broadens its critique to address the general nature of semantic rules and their relationship to speaker behavior. The text then shifts focus to CRS, using examples and logical arguments to demonstrate its incoherence. Throughout, the text builds a case for its thesis by systematically dismantling opposing views and providing supporting arguments for its own position.

## SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS

1. **The Author's Main Position**
   - **Quote**: "The most natural assumption is that they are idealized descriptions of what people mean when they speak and write (etc.). If this assumption is right, then, given the points just made, the view in question is wrong."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears early in the text, setting up the critique of the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive.
   - **Significance**: It encapsulates the author's main position that semantic rules cannot be merely descriptive, as this would render them psychologically inert and unable to guide speech acts.

2. **Key Supporting Argument**
   - **Quote**: "I know that Smith is now living in France. Wanting to tell you this, I say: 'Smith is now living in France.' Why do I choose this particular sentence? Because, first of all, I know the relevant semantic rules (viz. that 'Smith' refers to Smith, that 'living' refers to a certain property) and, secondly, because I believe that, given these facts about semantics, the sentence in question is the right one to express my belief."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive.
   - **Significance**: It provides a concrete example to support the argument that semantic rules are normative and psychologically active, guiding the choice of sentences in speech acts.

3. **Crucial Definition or Conceptual Distinction**
   - **Quote**: "Expressions have meanings. A meaningless burst of noise isn't an expression. If I cough or guffaw, the burst of noise I've produced doesn't have the sort of meaning had by bona fide expressions."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section discussing the incoherence of Wittgenstein's claim that "meaning is use."
   - **Significance**: It draws a crucial distinction between expressions with linguistic meaning and meaningless noises, which is essential for the critique of conceptual role semantics.

4. **Position Being Criticized or Refuted**
   - **Quote**: "This view is held by Nathan Salmon (2007) and also by Scott Soames (2002). This view is inconsistent with some obvious facts."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive.
   - **Significance**: It identifies specific proponents of the view being criticized, adding weight to the critique by naming influential figures in the field.

5. **Methodological Statement**
   - **Quote**: "If semantic rules are just idealizations of speaker-behavior, then speaker-behavior must pre-exist the semantic rules embodied in it."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive.
   - **Significance**: It outlines a methodological approach to understanding semantic rules, suggesting that if they are merely descriptive, they cannot guide behavior.

6. **Pivotal Turn in the Argument**
   - **Quote**: "Another problem with the Salmon-Soames view is that it's inconsistent with the normative character of semantic rules."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive.
   - **Significance**: It marks a pivotal turn in the argument, shifting from the psychological reality of semantic rules to their normative character.

7. **Critique of Conceptual Role Semantics**
   - **Quote**: "According to a doctrine known as 'conceptual role semantics' (CRS), whose exponents include Hartry Field (1977) and Robert Brandom (1994), for an expression to have a given meaning is simply for it to be used in a certain way. But this isn't correct as we just saw."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing conceptual role semantics.
   - **Significance**: It introduces CRS and immediately refutes it, setting the stage for a detailed critique of this view.

8. **Distinction Between Causal Determination and Identity**
   - **Quote**: "There is all the difference in the world between saying: (1) Expression E's having meaning M is causally determined by E's being used in such and such a manner, and (2) Expression E's having meaning M is identical with E's being used in such and such a manner."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing conceptual role semantics.
   - **Significance**: It draws a crucial distinction between causal determination and identity, which is central to the critique of CRS.

9. **Critique of CRS's View on Inference and Meaning**
   - **Quote**: "If we learn tomorrow that, contrary to what we previously thought, Aristotle wrote several plays, we'll infer 'somebody who wrote several plays wrote the Nichomachean Ethics' from 'Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics.' But it doesn't follow that 'Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics' would have undergone some change in its semantic meaning."
   - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing conceptual role semantics.
   - **Significance**: It provides a concrete example to refute CRS's claim that meaning is determined by inferences, showing that changes in beliefs affect inferences but not meanings.

10. **Implication of CRS's View**
    - **Quote**: "CRS entails that every inference is an analytic inference. Once it's learned that Aristotle wrote plays, it becomes, according to CRS, constitutive of the meaning of 'Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics' that one can infer from it that a playwright wrote the Nichomachean Ethics."
    - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the section critiquing conceptual role semantics.
    - **Significance**: It highlights an absurd implication of CRS, that every inference would be analytic, which supports the argument that CRS is incoherent.

## SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL MOVES DEPLOYED

### 4.1 Conceptual Analysis and Distinctions Drawn

- **Conceptual Analysis**
  - The text engages in conceptual analysis by examining the nature of semantic rules and their relationship to speaker behavior. It analyzes the concept of meaning and its relationship to use, particularly in the critique of Wittgenstein's claim that "meaning is use."
  - **Example**: The text analyzes the concept of semantic rules, arguing that they are not merely descriptive but normative and psychologically active.

- **Distinctions Drawn**
  - The text draws several important distinctions, such as between meaning and use, causal determination and identity, and expressions with linguistic meaning and meaningless noises.
  - **Example**: The distinction between causal determination and identity is crucial for the critique of conceptual role semantics, as it argues that use can causally determine meaning but cannot be identical with it.

### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies

- **Reductio ad Absurdum**
  - The text uses reductio ad absurdum to critique conceptual role semantics, showing that if CRS were true, it would lead to absurd consequences such as the non-existence of sentences.
  - **Example**: The text argues that if CRS were correct, it would entail that every inference is analytic, leading to the absurd consequence that no sentence could mean anything.

- **Modus Tollens**
  - The text employs modus tollens in its critique of the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive, arguing that if semantic rules were merely descriptive, they would be psychologically inert, which is false; therefore, semantic rules are not merely descriptive.
  - **Example**: "If semantic rules are just idealizations of speaker-behavior, then speaker-behavior must pre-exist the semantic rules embodied in it. But if that's the case, then the activity described by semantic rules isn't guided by them. An awareness of those rules is no part of what leads people to say the things they do. Those rules are psychologically inert. They have no 'psychological reality.'"

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

- **Category Error Detection**
  - The text detects a category error in the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive, arguing that this view conflates the descriptive with the normative and psychologically active nature of semantic rules.
  - **Example**: The text argues that semantic rules cannot be merely descriptive because they guide speech acts, which is a normative and psychologically active function.

### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning

- **Counterfactual Reasoning**
  - The text uses counterfactual reasoning to critique conceptual role semantics, imagining scenarios where beliefs change to show that inferences do not determine meaning.
  - **Example**: "If we learn tomorrow that, contrary to what we previously thought, Aristotle wrote several plays, we'll infer 'somebody who wrote several plays wrote the Nichomachean Ethics' from 'Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics.' But it doesn't follow that 'Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics' would have undergone some change in its semantic meaning."

### 4.5 Thought Experiments

- **Thought Experiments**
  - The text employs thought experiments to illustrate its points, such as the example of choosing the sentence "Smith is now living in France" to convey a belief.
  - **Example**: "I know that Smith is now living in France. Wanting to tell you this, I say: 'Smith is now living in France.' Why do I choose this particular sentence? Because, first of all, I know the relevant semantic rules (viz. that 'Smith' refers to Smith, that 'living' refers to a certain property) and, secondly, because I believe that, given these facts about semantics, the sentence in question is the right one to express my belief."

### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons

- **Analogies and Comparisons**
  - The text uses analogies and comparisons to clarify its points, such as comparing the meaning of expressions to the meaning of noises like coughs or guffaws.
  - **Example**: "If I cough or guffaw, the burst of noise I've produced doesn't have the sort of meaning had by bona fide expressions. It has, at most, meaning in irrelevant, purely evidential sense, e.g., the sense in which a cough may be evidence of a cold."

### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition

- **Appeals to Intuition**
  - The text appeals to intuition to support its arguments, such as the intuitive understanding that semantic rules guide speech acts.
  - **Example**: The text's example of choosing the sentence "Smith is now living in France" appeals to the reader's intuition that this choice is guided by knowledge of semantic rules.

### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation

- **Inference to Best Explanation**
  - The text uses inference to the best explanation to argue that the normative and psychologically active nature of semantic rules best explains how speakers choose their words.
  - **Example**: The text argues that the best explanation for why speakers choose certain sentences is that they are guided by semantic rules, which are normative and psychologically active.

### 4.9 Transcendental Arguments

- **Transcendental Arguments**
  - The text employs transcendental arguments to argue that semantic rules must be normative and psychologically active because without them, speech acts could not be guided.
  - **Example**: The text argues that if semantic rules were not normative and psychologically active, they could not guide speech acts, which is a necessary condition for language use.

### 4.10 Dialectical Moves

- **Dialectical Moves**
  - The text engages in dialectical moves by presenting and critiquing opposing views, such as those of Nathan Salmon, Scott Soames, Hartry Field, and Robert Brandom.
  - **Example**: The text presents the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive, critiques it, then presents and critiques conceptual role semantics.

### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies

- **Deconstructive Strategies**
  - The text uses deconstructive strategies to dismantle the views it critiques, showing how they are internally inconsistent or lead to absurd consequences.
  - **Example**: The text deconstructs conceptual role semantics by showing that it leads to the absurd consequence that no sentence could mean anything.

### 4.12 Hermeneutical Approaches

- **Hermeneutical Approaches**
  - The text employs hermeneutical approaches by interpreting and critiquing the views of other philosophers, such as Wittgenstein's claim that "meaning is use."
  - **Example**: The text interprets Wittgenstein's claim and critiques it, arguing that it is incoherent because expressions must have meaning before they can be used.

  - The text repurposes the concept of semantic rules from a descriptive to a normative and psychologically active role.

## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE

### 8.1 Overall Organization of the Argument

The text is organized into two main sections: a critique of the view that semantic rules are merely descriptive, and a critique of conceptual role semantics. It begins with a specific example to illustrate its point about semantic rules, then broadens its critique to address the general nature of semantic rules and their relationship to speaker behavior. The text then shifts focus to conceptual role semantics, using examples and logical arguments to demonstrate its incoherence.

1. **Primary Formulation**: The literal meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its simple parts and the way those parts are arranged.
   - This thesis is articulated throughout the text, particularly in sections discussing the relationship between simple and complex expressions.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The literal meaning of simple expressions coincides with what people take them to mean, while the literal meaning of complex expressions may diverge from what people understand them to mean.
   - This formulation is evident in the text's discussion of how systematic error is impossible with simple expressions but possible with complex ones.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Literal Meaning of Simple Expressions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the literal meaning of simple expressions is determined by what people take them to mean. This is because systematic, widespread error is impossible with simple expressions.
   - **Evidence**: The text uses the example of the word "red" to illustrate this point, stating that if people thought "red" meant what is meant by "blue," then "red" would have that meaning.

2. **Argument 2: Literal Meaning of Complex Expressions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the literal meaning of complex expressions is a function of the meanings of their simple parts and the order in which those parts are arranged.
   - **Evidence**: The text uses the example of the sentence "Socrates was more wise than Plato, but he was less sharp then Aristotle" to illustrate how the literal meaning of a complex expression is determined by its simple parts and their arrangement.

3. **Argument 3: Systematic Misinterpretation**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that systematic misinterpretations of sentences arise from people not knowing how to put the meanings of simple expressions together, not from failing to know what the simple parts mean.
   - **Evidence**: The text discusses how people may misunderstand the sentence about Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, but this misunderstanding is due to difficulty in combining the meanings of the simple parts, not in understanding the simple parts themselves.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the semantics of certain linguistic expressions, particularly indexicals and definite descriptions, are determined by context-sensitive rules that assign referents based on the circumstances of utterance. This can be formulated in multiple ways:

1. **Primary Formulation**: The meaning of indexicals and definite descriptions is determined by rules that systematically assign referents based on the context of utterance.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: Indexicals and definite descriptions have a two-dimensional semantic structure, where the meaning of a token is its referent, and the meaning of the type is the rule that assigns that referent.

3. **Tertiary Formulation**: Indexical-free languages are expressively impoverished because they cannot convey perspectival information that relies on context.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: The Semantics of Indexicals**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that indexicals like "I," "that guy," and "tomorrow" refer to different entities based on the context of utterance. The rule for "I" is that it refers to the person who produced the utterance, while "that guy" refers to a unique, salient individual in the context. This demonstrates that the meaning of indexicals is context-dependent.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples such as "I am tired" and "that guy is tall" to illustrate how the same expression can refer to different entities in different contexts.

2. **Argument 2: The Two-Dimensional Semantic Structure of Indexicals**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that indexicals have a two-dimensional semantic structure, where the meaning of a token is its referent, and the meaning of the type is the rule that assigns that referent. This structure allows for the same rule to apply across different contexts, resulting in different referents.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of "today" is used to show how the same rule can assign different referents (April 27, 2009, and April 28, 2009) based on the day of utterance.

3. **Argument 3: The Semantics of Definite Descriptions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that definite descriptions, like indexicals, have a two-dimensional semantic structure. The rule for "the current U.S. President" assigns different referents (Barack Obama and Bill Clinton) based on the time of utterance, but the rule itself remains constant.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples of how the same description can refer to different individuals at different times, illustrating the context-sensitivity of definite descriptions.

4. **Argument 4: The Expressive Limitations of Indexical-Free Languages**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that languages without indexicals are expressively impoverished because they cannot convey perspectival information that relies on context. This limitation is due to the inability to express information relative to the speaker's perspective.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses the example of expressing the weather in Richmond on a specific date to show how an indexical-free language would require cumbersome and less intuitive expressions.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Demonstratives vs. Indexicals**
   - **Explanation**: The text distinguishes between demonstratives and other indexicals, noting that demonstratives require an accompanying demonstration to eliminate ambiguity in reference.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of "that guy" is used to illustrate how pointing can disambiguate the referent when multiple salient individuals are present.

2. **Incomplete Definite Descriptions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that some definite descriptions are incomplete and require context to pick out a single referent. The context supplies the necessary information to enrich the mediating concept.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of "the bald guy" is used to show how context can determine which bald individual is being referred to.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Contextualism**: The text assumes that the meaning of linguistic expressions is heavily influenced by the context in which they are used. This assumption underlies the entire discussion of indexicals and definite descriptions.

2. **Semantic Rules**: The text assumes that the meaning of expressions can be captured by formal semantic rules that systematically assign referents based on context. This assumption is crucial for the two-dimensional semantic structure argument.

3. **Perspectival Information**: The text assumes that much of the information we convey is perspectival and relies on the speaker's context. This assumption supports the argument about the expressive limitations of indexical-free languages.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument follows a deductive structure, where the core thesis is supported by a series of sub-arguments and examples. The logical flow can be outlined as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: Indexicals refer to different entities based on the context of utterance.
2. **Premise 2**: Indexicals have a two-dimensional semantic structure, where the meaning of a token is its referent, and the meaning of the type is the rule that assigns that referent.
3. **Premise 3**: Definite descriptions, like indexicals, have a two-dimensional semantic structure and are context-sensitive.
4. **Premise 4**: Indexical-free languages are expressively impoverished because they cannot convey perspectival information.
5. **Conclusion**: The semantics of indexicals and definite descriptions are determined by context-sensitive rules that assign referents based on the circumstances of utterance.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

The text progresses through a series of sections, each building on the previous to develop the overall argument:

1. **Section 7.1**: Introduces the concept of indexicals and their context-sensitivity, laying the groundwork for the core thesis.
2. **Section 7.1.1**: Distinguishes between demonstratives and other indexicals, providing a more nuanced understanding of context-sensitivity.
3. **Section 7.1.2**: Develops the two-dimensional semantic structure argument for indexicals, using examples to illustrate the concept.
4. **Section 7.2**: Extends the two-dimensional semantic structure argument to definite descriptions, showing how they are also context-sensitive.
5. **Section 7.2.1**: Discusses incomplete definite descriptions and how context enriches the mediating concept, further supporting the context-sensitivity argument.
6. **Section 7.3**: Concludes with the argument about the expressive limitations of indexical-free languages, tying together the importance of context in language use.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text can be articulated in multiple formulations:

1. **Primary Formulation**: The meaning of a sentence token is a proposition, while the meaning of a sentence type is a rule that assigns propositions to its tokens based on the context of utterance.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: Context-sensitive expressions are essential for expressing perspectival thoughts and beliefs, and an indexical-free language would be severely impoverished.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Distinction Between Beliefs and Thoughts**: The text argues that different beliefs and thoughts can be held independently of each other, even when they are about the same state of affairs. For example, believing it's 60° in Richmond on Feb. 07, 2009, is different from thinking it's now 60° in Richmond, even if one is in Richmond at the time. This supports the thesis by illustrating the necessity of context-sensitive expressions to capture these nuances.

   - **Explanation**: The text uses the example of temperature beliefs to show that context-sensitive expressions like "now" and "here" are necessary to express specific thoughts and beliefs accurately. Without these expressions, the language would fail to capture the perspectival nature of these beliefs.

2. **Necessity of Indexicals for Perspectival Thoughts**: The text asserts that nothing perspectival can be expressed without using indexicals. This is because indexicals allow speakers to express thoughts about their immediate context, such as "I am thirsty" or "it's now 60° here."

   - **Explanation**: The argument is that indexicals are crucial for expressing thoughts that are tied to the speaker's perspective. Without them, language would be limited to third-person descriptions, which cannot capture the first-person perspective.

3. **Semantic Role of Sentence Types and Tokens**: The text argues that sentence types containing context-sensitive components do not bear truth values; instead, it is the tokens of these types that make statements and bear truth values based on the context of utterance.

   - **Explanation**: This argument supports the thesis by explaining how the meaning of a sentence token is a proposition determined by the context, while the meaning of a sentence type is a rule that assigns these propositions. This distinction is crucial for understanding how context affects meaning.

4. **Context-Sensitivity and Proposition Assignment**: The text posits that the semantic rule for context-sensitive expressions assigns propositions to tokens based on the context of utterance. For example, the truth of "I am tired" depends on who is speaking and when.

   - **Explanation**: This argument illustrates how context-sensitive expressions require a semantic rule that takes into account the context to assign the correct proposition to a token. This supports the thesis by showing the dynamic nature of meaning in context-sensitive language.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Rationality of Independent Beliefs**: The text claims that one can rationally hold any given belief about a state of affairs without holding others, even if they are about the same state of affairs. This supports the necessity of context-sensitive expressions to capture these rational distinctions.

2. **Impoverishment of Indexical-Free Language**: The text argues that an indexical-free language would be extremely impoverished because it could not express perspectival thoughts like "I am JM" or "I am that guy in the mirror."

3. **Non-Ambiguity of Context-Sensitive Sentences**: The text asserts that context-sensitive sentences are not ambiguous; they have one meaning, which is a rule that assigns propositions to their tokens based on context.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Contextual Dependence of Meaning**: The text assumes that the meaning of many expressions depends on the context in which they are used, which is a foundational assumption for the arguments about indexicals and context-sensitivity.

2. **Distinction Between Types and Tokens**: The text assumes that there is a meaningful distinction between sentence types and tokens, which is crucial for the argument about how meaning is assigned.

3. **Importance of Perspectival Thoughts**: The text assumes that perspectival thoughts are significant and that language should be capable of expressing them, which underlies the argument about the necessity of indexicals.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument can be broken down into the following logical structure:

1. **Premise 1**: Different beliefs and thoughts about the same state of affairs can be held independently.
2. **Premise 2**: Context-sensitive expressions are necessary to express these independent beliefs and thoughts accurately.
3. **Premise 3**: Sentence types containing context-sensitive components do not bear truth values; instead, tokens of these types make statements and bear truth values based on the context of utterance.
4. **Premise 4**: The semantic rule for context-sensitive expressions assigns propositions to tokens based on the context of utterance.
5. **Conclusion**: The meaning of a sentence token is a proposition, while the meaning of a sentence type is a rule that assigns propositions to its tokens based on the context of utterance.

1. **Distinction Between Beliefs and Thoughts**: The initial distinction between beliefs and thoughts sets the stage for the argument about the necessity of context-sensitive expressions.

2. **Necessity of Indexicals**: The argument about the necessity of indexicals depends on the initial distinction, as it shows how indexicals are needed to express the nuanced beliefs and thoughts introduced earlier.

3. **Semantic Role of Types and Tokens**: The argument about the semantic roles of types and tokens depends on the necessity of indexicals, as it explains how context-sensitive expressions work to convey meaning.

4. **Context-Sensitivity and Proposition Assignment**: The argument about how context-sensitive expressions assign propositions depends on the semantic roles of types and tokens, as it provides the mechanism for how context affects meaning.

5. **Non-Ambiguity and Context-Sensitivity**: The final argument about the non-ambiguity of context-sensitive sentences depends on all the previous claims, as it clarifies the nature of meaning in context-sensitive language.

### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions

The text progresses from premises to conclusions in a systematic manner:

1. **Premise 1**: Different beliefs and thoughts about the same state of affairs can be held independently.
2. **Premise 2**: Context-sensitive expressions are necessary to express these independent beliefs and thoughts accurately.
3. **Premise 3**: Sentence types containing context-sensitive components do not bear truth values; instead, tokens of these types make statements and bear truth values based on the context of utterance.
4. **Premise 4**: The semantic rule for context-sensitive expressions assigns propositions to tokens based on the context of utterance.
5. **Conclusion**: The meaning of a sentence token is a proposition, while the meaning of a sentence type is a rule that assigns propositions to its tokens based on the context of utterance.

### 8.4 Use of Examples, Illustrations, or Case Studies

The text uses several examples and illustrations to support its arguments:

1. **Temperature Beliefs**: The text uses the example of temperature beliefs to illustrate the distinction between beliefs and thoughts and the necessity of context-sensitive expressions.

2. **"I am tired"**: The text uses the example of the sentence "I am tired" to illustrate how the meaning of a token depends on the context of utterance.

3. **"That man is married to that woman"**: The text uses this example to illustrate how the semantic rule assigns a proposition to a token based on the context of utterance.

4. **"That person is a professor"**: The text uses this example to illustrate the non-ambiguity of context-sensitive sentences and how the meaning of a token depends on the context.

### 8.5 Anticipation and Response to Objections

The text anticipates and responds to potential objections:

1. **Ambiguity of Context-Sensitive Sentences**: The text anticipates the objection that context-sensitive sentences might be ambiguous and responds by arguing that these sentences have one meaning, which is a rule that assigns propositions to tokens based on context.

2. **Traditional Views on Meaning**: The text anticipates the objection that sentence types can bear truth values and responds by arguing that it is the tokens that bear truth values based on context.

### 8.6 Dialectical Structure

The text's argument has a dialectical structure, with the following elements:

1. **Thesis**: The meaning of a sentence token is a proposition, while the meaning of a sentence type is a rule that assigns propositions to its tokens based on the context of utterance.

2. **Antithesis**: Traditional views on meaning attribute truth values to sentence types, and context-sensitive sentences might be considered ambiguous.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text can be articulated in multiple formulations:

1. **Primary Formulation**: Semantic rules assign meanings to properties, and these meanings are themselves semantic rules that assign meanings to instances of those properties.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: All expressions, including those that appear context-insensitive, have a two-dimensional semantic structure where type-meaning diverges from token-meaning due to context-sensitivity.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Semantic Rules and Properties**:
   - The text argues that semantic rules assign meanings to properties, and these meanings are themselves semantic rules. For example, the property of having a morphology similar to the ink deposit "Barack Obama" is assigned a meaning that is a semantic rule, which in turn assigns Barack Obama to any instance of that property.
   - This argument is supported by the example of the ink deposit "Barack Obama," where the semantic rule assigns the meaning of the person Barack Obama to any instance of the property.

2. **Context-Sensitivity of All Expressions**:
   - The text asserts that all expressions, even those that appear context-insensitive, are context-sensitive due to the presence of tense-markers and other context-sensitive components.
   - This is supported by the example of the sentence "the U.S. economy is fairly stable," where the truth of the proposition depends on when the sentence is uttered.

3. **Distinction Between Type-Meaning and Token-Meaning**:
   - The text argues that the meaning of an expression-type (type-meaning) is distinct from the meaning of its tokens (token-meaning) due to context-sensitivity.
   - This is illustrated by the example of the sentence "the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°," where the tense-marker on "add" is context-sensitive, even though the sentence appears to express an atemporal proposition.

4. **Eternal Sentences and Context-Insensitivity**:
   - The text challenges the notion of eternal sentences, which are supposed to express the same proposition regardless of context, by arguing that even these sentences are context-sensitive at the level of literal meaning.
   - This is supported by the example of the sentence "the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°," where the tense-marker is argued to be context-sensitive, even if it is often treated as inert.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Pragmatics-Based Context-Insensitivity**:
   - The text claims that any apparent context-insensitivity of expressions is a result of pragmatics rather than semantics.
   - This is supported by the example of the sentence "the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°," where the context-insensitivity is attributed to our beliefs about mathematics rather than the sentence's literal meaning.

2. **Proper Names and Two-Dimensional Semantics**:
   - The text argues that even proper names, which might seem to have fixed referents, have a two-dimensional semantic structure.
   - This is illustrated by the example of "Bill Clinton," where the expression-token is a physical entity capable of transmitting information, while the expression-type is an abstract entity.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Semantic Rules as Fundamental**: The text assumes that semantic rules are the fundamental units of meaning assignment in language.
2. **Context-Sensitivity as Universal**: There is an implicit assumption that all expressions in natural languages are context-sensitive to some degree.
3. **Distinction Between Type and Token**: The text assumes a clear distinction between expression-types and expression-tokens, with the former being abstract and the latter being physical.
4. **Pragmatics and Semantics**: The text assumes that pragmatics can influence our perception of semantic context-sensitivity, even if the literal meaning remains context-sensitive.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument follows a deductive structure, moving from general principles about semantic rules and context-sensitivity to specific examples and conclusions:

1. **Premise 1**: Semantic rules assign meanings to properties, and these meanings are themselves semantic rules.
2. **Premise 2**: All expressions in natural languages contain context-sensitive components, such as tense-markers.
3. **Premise 3**: The meaning of an expression-type (type-meaning) is distinct from the meaning of its tokens (token-meaning) due to context-sensitivity.
4. **Conclusion**: All expressions, including those that appear context-insensitive, have a two-dimensional semantic structure where type-meaning diverges from token-meaning.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of Semantic Rules**: The text begins by introducing the concept of semantic rules and their role in assigning meanings to properties and instances.
2. **Context-Sensitivity of Expressions**: It then moves to discuss the context-sensitivity of all expressions, using examples like "the U.S. economy is fairly stable" to illustrate how context affects meaning.
3. **Analysis of Apparent Context-Insensitivity**: The text then addresses apparent counterexamples, such as "the interior angles of a Euclidean triangle add up to 180°," arguing that even these sentences are context-sensitive at the level of literal meaning.
4. **Eternal Sentences and Pragmatics**: It challenges the notion of eternal sentences and argues that any apparent context-insensitivity is a result of pragmatics rather than semantics.
5. **Proper Names and Two-Dimensional Semantics**: Finally, the text extends its analysis to proper names, arguing that even these have a two-dimensional semantic structure.

   - **Where it appears**: In the sections discussing the context-sensitivity of all expressions.
   - **How it functions**: By showing that all expressions contain context-sensitive components like tense-markers, the text argues that if an expression were truly context-insensitive, it would not contain such components, leading to the conclusion that no expressions are context-insensitive.

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

1. **Expression-Types vs. Expression-Tokens**: The text identifies a category error in treating expression-types and expression-tokens as the same kind of entity.
   - **Where it appears**: In the section discussing proper names and the nature of expression-types and expression-tokens.
   - **How it functions**: By highlighting that expression-tokens are physical entities capable of transmitting information, while expression-types are abstract entities, the text argues that proper names, like all expressions, have a two-dimensional semantic structure.

### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning

1. **Argument 1: Expression-Types as Properties**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that expression-types are properties, which are non-spatiotemporal entities. This is supported by the claim that properties per se, as opposed to their instances, are assigned meanings, and properties are non-spatiotemporal.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "expression-types, unlike expression-tokens, are properties and are therefore non-spatiotemporal entities."

2. **Argument 2: Non-Symbolic Nature of Types**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that non-spatiotemporal entities cannot mediate information or function as symbols. Since expression-types are non-spatiotemporal, they cannot be symbols.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "it makes no sense to suppose a nonspatiotemporal entity could mediate information or, therefore, could in any significant sense be a symbol."

3. **Argument 3: Semantic Functions of Types and Tokens**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that due to the profound metaphysical differences between tokens and types, it would be theoretically arbitrary to suppose that types could discharge the same semantic functions as their tokens.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "given the profound metaphysical differences between tokens and types, it would be theoretical arbitrariness of the worst kind to suppose that types could discharge the same semantic functions as their tokens."

4. **Argument 4: Two-Dimensional Semantics**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that proper names, indexicals, and definite descriptions have two-dimensional semantics, with semantic rules assigning meanings differently to types and tokens.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "In general, proper names, no less than indexicals and definite descriptions have two-dimensional semantics."

5. **Argument 5: Logical Form and Quantifiers**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that statements containing quantifiers are about properties rather than specific objects, and their logical form diverges from their grammatical form.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "Some statements that, given their grammatical forms, appear to be about objects are in fact about properties."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Semantic Rules for Types and Tokens**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that semantic rules assign meanings differently to properties (types) and their instances (tokens). The meaning assigned to a type is a rule, while the meaning assigned to a token is a proposition.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "the rules that assign meanings to properties are semantic rules, since anything that assigns meaning to anything is ipso facto a semantic rule."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Frege's Insight on Logical Form**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that Frege was the first to recognize the divergence between logical and grammatical forms, particularly in statements about properties.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text states, "Frege was the first to see clearly that logical and grammatical may diverge-he was the first to grasp the very idea of such a divergence."

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Quantified sentences in natural language are pseudo-objectual statements that appear to be about objects but are really about properties, necessitating a reparse to expose their logical forms.
   - This thesis is articulated in the opening sentence: "concerns properties. In natural language, quantified sentences are pseudo-objectual statements. They appear to be about objects, but are really about properties. That is why they must be reparsed if their logical forms are to be exposed."

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The divergence between a statement's grammatical form and its logical form is a consequence of the need to define certain expressions contextually.
   - This is evident in the passage: "The divergence between SS's grammatical and logical forms is obviously a consequence of the fact that 'someone' must be defined contextually."

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Quantified Sentences and Properties**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that quantified sentences, such as "someone snores," are not about specific individuals but about the instantiation of properties. This is supported by the claim that "someone" does not refer to any specific individual but rather to the instantiation of a property.
   - **Supporting Passage**: "So, for example, 'someone' doesn't refer to anyone. It doesn't refer to John or Sally or Jane. That is why, given any proper name N, the statement (NS) ‹N doesn't snore› is compatible with (SS) 'someone snores.'"

2. **Argument 2: Contextual Definition and Logical Form**
   - **Explanation**: The text asserts that the divergence between grammatical and logical forms is due to the need for contextual definitions. Expressions like "someone" must be defined in terms of how they affect the meaning of sentences containing them, rather than by direct reference to objects.
   - **Supporting Passage**: "The fact that grammatical and logical form sometimes diverge is related to the fact some expressions are to be defined contextually. To define an expression contextually is to how, in virtue of containing it, a sentence's meaning is affected."

3. **Argument 3: Frege's Contribution**
   - **Explanation**: The text credits Frege with discovering the divergence between grammatical and logical forms, which is foundational to modern analytic philosophy. This argument supports the thesis by establishing a historical and philosophical context for the analysis of logical forms.
   - **Supporting Passage**: "Frege discovered both facts and, therewith, created modern analytic philosophy."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Not All Contextual Definitions Lead to Divergence**
   - **Explanation**: The text acknowledges that not all expressions defined contextually lead to a divergence between grammatical and logical forms. This claim refines the primary argument by specifying the conditions under which such divergences occur.
   - **Supporting Passage**: "Nonetheless, it would be an overstatement to say that whenever a sentence contains an expression that must be defined contextually, it's grammatical form pulls apart from its logical form."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Denotative Definitions and Logical Form**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that expressions that can be defined denotatively, such as proper names like "Socrates," do not necessarily lead to a divergence between grammatical and logical forms. This claim further refines the primary argument by distinguishing between different types of definitions.
   - **Supporting Passage**: "Whenever an expression can be defined denotatively, a sentence's logical form will not, by virtue of that sentence's containing that expression, diverge from its logical form."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Logical Form as the True Structure**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that the logical form of a sentence is its true or underlying structure, which may differ from its surface grammatical form. This assumption underpins the entire analysis of quantified sentences and contextual definitions.

2. **Assumption 2: Importance of Context in Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that the meaning of expressions is heavily dependent on the context in which they are used. This assumption is crucial for the argument about contextual definitions and their impact on logical form.

3. **Assumption 3: Frege's Authority**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that Frege's insights into the divergence between grammatical and logical forms are authoritative and foundational to the field. This assumption supports the historical and philosophical context provided for the thesis.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1**: Quantified sentences in natural language are pseudo-objectual statements about properties rather than objects.

2. **Pseudo-Objectual Statements**: Statements that appear to be about objects but are actually about properties.
   - **Evidence**: "They appear to be about objects, but are really about properties."

3. **Logical Form**: The underlying structure of a sentence that reveals its true meaning, which may diverge from its grammatical form.
   - **Evidence**: "It immediately follows that a statement's grammatical form may diverge from its logical form."

4. **Grammatical Form**: The surface structure of a sentence as it appears in natural language.
   - **Evidence**: "It immediately follows that a statement's grammatical form may diverge from its logical form."

5. **Contextual Definition**: A definition of an expression in terms of how it affects the meaning of sentences containing it.
