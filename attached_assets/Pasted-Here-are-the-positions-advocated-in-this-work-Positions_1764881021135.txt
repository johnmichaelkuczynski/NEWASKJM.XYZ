Here are the positions advocated in this work:

---

## **Positions Extracted from *OCD and Philosophy: Short Papers on OCD, Psychopathy, and Psychopathology***

### **I. The Nature of OCD**

1. **OCD is fundamentally a defense mechanism.** It provides relief from anxiety so intense as to be "almost inconceivable" to those who haven't experienced it.

2. **OCD is ultimately a voluntary affliction—an affliction of the will.** Unlike cancer or asthma, OCD involves the integrity of one's will and can be overcome by exercising that will.

3. **OCD symptoms are only "involuntary" relative to a determination to remain disengaged from the world.** If one chooses re-engagement, the symptoms become voluntary and controllable.

4. **OCD can assume productive, non-pathological forms.** Beethoven and Einstein exemplify OCD channeled adaptively.

5. **OCD involves misdeployed intelligence and focus.** It represents heightened abilities directed maladaptively.

6. **OCD creates a psychological "safe-space."** Obsessions and compulsions encircle and protect the subject from a toxic, threatening environment.

7. **The obsessive-compulsive is a "crypto-criminal."** Their fundamental orientation toward others is anti-social, but strong superegos cause them to suppress their criminal side through legalistic preoccupations.

8. **Obsessive-compulsives are driven by rage, narcissism, and fear—not rationality.** Their intellectualism is a reaction to, and attempt to cloak, their "darkly retrograde psychological condition."

9. **The obsessive-compulsive's doubts about the external world are actually displaced doubts about the internal world.** They are uncertain about their own psychic contents, not about external reality.

10. **The obsessive-compulsive must accept his own sadistic sexuality.** (Title indicates this as a thesis, though the section is truncated.)

### **II. OCD and Philosophy—The Structural Parallel**

11. **Philosophers and obsessive-compulsives share the same psychological structure.** Both are compulsive doubters who doubt the obvious under the guise of rigor.

12. **Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are impotent—too fearful to engage the world directly.** Their potency lies only in manipulating symbolic proxies of reality.

13. **Both attempt to internalize the world into the sphere of their own thought, where they are dominant.** This is compensatory behavior for worldly impotence.

14. **Preoccupation with logical niceties and fine points of argumentation is derivative of a sense of impotence.** When one has no material of one's own, one preoccupies oneself with secondary, formal matters.

15. **Conditionalizing acceptance of hypotheses on subtleties of proof allows indefinite deferral of engagement with reality.** Logical and dialectical niceties are "incapable of being definitely resolved" by their very nature.

16. **Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are pathologically concerned with ethics.** This stems from their crypto-criminal nature combined with draconian superegos.

17. **Philosophical insistence on the "rationality of man" is merely an idealization—a projected self-image.** It does not describe actual human psychology.

18. **The Lockean/Cartesian denial of the unconscious is a "tendentious rationalization."** The claim that mind extends only as far as consciousness is "brazenly spurious."

19. **The obsessive-compulsive/philosopher believes himself a "logic-driven Cartesian ratiocinator" when his Cartesianism is only a thin veneer.** Beneath lies a "Nietzschean cesspool."

20. **Many obsessive-compulsives and philosophers go into law.** This follows from their preoccupation with legalistic technicalities.

### **III. Treatment and Prognosis**

21. **The way to beat OCD is to have a purpose in life.** Purpose-directed engagement with the world is therapeutic.

22. **CBT has limited, shallow, and short-lived effects on OCD.** It cannot work absent a deeper determination to grow and change.

23. **The prognosis for OCD is 100% positive if the patient sees OCD as the voluntary condition it is.** If seen as a "garden-variety pathology," the prognosis is negative.

24. **OCD is eliminated (or made adaptive) by exercising one's will in growth-oriented ways.** The obsessive-compulsive must choose: mere freedom from anxiety, or living and growing.

25. **Effective therapists must have and project inner strength.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

26. **"Structural therapy" is advocated as an approach.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

27. **"Turn OCD against itself" is a therapeutic strategy.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

### **IV. Mental Illness vs. Physical Illness**

28. **Mental illness is NOT "an illness like any other."** It differs categorically from physical illness.

29. **Mental illnesses are contextual in nature.** OCD is a liability in some contexts and an asset in others. Physical illnesses (asthma, lupus, cancer) are simply liabilities in all contexts.

30. **Mental illnesses serve a defensive/protective function.** Even gravely dysfunctional conditions like psychosis provide some measure of psychological safety.

31. **Psychosis is a chosen withdrawal from destructive negativity.** The psychotic retreats into delusion to escape threatening environments and assaults on self-worth.

32. **Some mental illnesses involve misdeployed strengths.** Schizophrenia involves misdeployed creativity and emotional sensitivity.

### **V. Psychopathy and Bureaucracy**

33. **Psychopaths are "rogue bureaucrats."** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

34. **Bureaucrats are "non-rogue psychopaths."** (Title indicates this as a thesis—i.e., bureaucratic psychology is structurally psychopathic.)

35. **There is a distinct "psychology of the bureaucrat."** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

36. **"Institutional psychopathy" exists as a phenomenon.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

37. **Psychopaths overachieve.** (Title indicates this as a thesis, with explanation presumably in truncated section.)

38. **Bureaucratic bloat is responsible for an OCD-spike.** (Title indicates this as a thesis—social/institutional factors cause increased OCD prevalence.)

### **VI. Social and Political Positions**

39. **Political philosophy has failed to engage reality.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

40. **"Submitting to feminism makes it more psychopathic."** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

41. **"Double-think" is psychologically possible and explicable.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

### **VII. Related Psychopathology**

42. **Social anxiety is fundamentally about rage.** (Title indicates this as a thesis—social anxiety masks underlying hostility.)

43. **Autism can be understood as "pseudo-self-containment."** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

44. **A healthy sex life has therapeutic significance.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

45. **There is such a thing as "psychiatric Munchausen's by proxy."** Parents (especially mothers) seek false psychiatric diagnoses for their children.

46. **False diagnoses of autism, Asperger's, and ADHD are forms of "cloaked child murder."** The mother, seeking attention from the husband, damages the child via psychiatric over-intervention.

47. **Psychiatrists and educational psychologists are generally unintelligent and willing to issue false diagnoses.** They need money and need to validate their profession.

48. **When a child is sent to a psychiatrist, the mother's psychology should be examined first.** The child's mind shows "fallout from the blast," not the epicenter.

49. **Intrusive thoughts in OCD have a specific explanation.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

50. **People with OCD have reading-related difficulties.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

51. **Compulsions without accompanying obsessions require distinct treatment.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)

### **VIII. Auto-Hypnosis vs. Rationalization**

52. **Auto-hypnosis is not inherently bad; it is essential for action.** Someone who only followed through on plans validated by critical judgment would be "the ultimate bureaucrat" and would never do anything.

53. **Auto-hypnosis is distinct from rationalization.** Auto-hypnosis generates attitude without deploying/misdeploying critical faculties; rationalization generates conviction from a warped understanding of reality.

54. **Negative auto-hypnosis (obsessing, ruminating, wallowing) is bad but easily reversed.** Once recognized as self-hypnosis, one can flip a mental switch to affirmative auto-hypnosis.

55. **Rationalization is inherently bad.** Unlike auto-hypnosis, it perverts one's faculty of judgment.

56. **Auto-hypnosis draws enthusiasm from within oneself; rationalization draws it from distorted cognition.**

### **IX. Intelligence and Intellectual Activity**

57. **There are two ways in which intellectual activity promotes intelligence.** (Title indicates this as a thesis.)
