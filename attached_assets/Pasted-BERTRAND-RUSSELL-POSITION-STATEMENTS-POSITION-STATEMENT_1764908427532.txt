BERTRAND RUSSELL POSITION STATEMENTS 

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MATTER (1927)

1. Physics tells us only about the structure of the physical world, not about its intrinsic nature.

2. Our knowledge of the external world is entirely structural or relational, never qualitative.

3. Events, not substances or particles, are the fundamental constituents of the physical world.

4. Percepts are a subset of the events that constitute the brain.

5. Naive realism is false: our percepts do not directly reveal the intrinsic qualities of external objects.

6. The only things we know non-inferentially are our own percepts and their qualities.

7. Physical objects are logical constructions out of events.

8. Causation is to be understood in terms of functional relations between events, not as a metaphysical power.

9. The distinction between mind and matter is not fundamental but reflects different causal arrangements of neutral events.

10. What physics describes as matter is really groups of events connected by causal laws.

11. Space-time structure is knowable through physics, but the intrinsic character of what occupies space-time is not.

12. Inference from percepts to their external causes is justified by the principle of causal continuity.

13. The qualities we directly experience (colors, sounds, etc.) exist only in percepts, not in external objects.

14. Physical space and perceptual space are distinct; physics deals only with the former.

15. The electron and other theoretical entities are logical fictions constructed from groups of events.

16. The causal theory of perception is the correct account of how we perceive external objects.

17. All empirical knowledge of the world beyond our percepts depends on causal inference.

18. The "matter" of physics is far more abstract than common sense supposes.

19. There is no good reason to believe that physical objects have any intrinsic nature beyond their structural properties.

20. The world described by physics is not the world of everyday experience but a mathematical abstraction.

21. Neutral monism provides a more economical ontology than either materialism or idealism.

22. Mind and brain are different aspects of the same underlying neutral events.

23. The only intrinsic qualities we know are the qualities of our own mental states.

24. Modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) supports a structural rather than substantival view of matter.

25. Space and time are not independent realities but aspects of the relations among events.

26. Perception involves a causal chain from external object to brain event, and the percept occurs at the end of that chain.

27. We cannot know whether the intrinsic nature of external events resembles the intrinsic nature of our percepts.

28. The common-sense distinction between "real" and "apparent" properties cannot be maintained.

29. Scientific inference from percepts to physics requires assuming that similar structures have similar causes.

30. The physical world is not directly observable; all observation is of percepts.

31. Traditional materialism errs in ascribing to matter qualities that belong only to percepts.

32. Physical objects do not have color, sound, smell, or any secondary qualities in themselves.

33. The brain is part of the physical world, and mental events are identical with certain brain events.

34. Our knowledge of physics is hypothetical knowledge about structure, confirmed by its predictive success.

35. The distinction between physics and psychology is a difference in the causal laws studied, not in the entities involved.

36. All that physics can legitimately assert about matter is its mathematical-structural properties.

37. The continuity of nature suggests that the intrinsic character of events outside brains is not wholly unlike percepts.

38. There is no dualistic gap between mind and matter because both reduce to events.

39. Substance is a metaphysical illusion; what exists is patterns of events.

40. The inference from percepts to external causes is probabilistic, not demonstrative.

41. Scientific realism must be reformulated as structural realism rather than naive realism about theoretical entities.

42. Quantum mechanics reveals that the classical picture of determinate particles is false.

43. The physical world is a four-dimensional manifold of events related by causal laws.

44. Perception gives us direct knowledge only of the terminus of a causal process, not of its origin.

45. The principle of spatiotemporal continuity in causation underwrites inference from effect to cause.

46. Mental causation is a species of physical causation involving brain events.

47. Epistemological dualism (between percepts and objects) does not entail ontological dualism (between mind and matter).

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921)

1. Mind and matter are both logical constructions out of a neutral stuff that is neither mental nor physical in itself.

2. Consciousness is not a unique substance or entity but a particular arrangement of neutral elements.

3. Sensations are the intersection point where physics and psychology meet; they belong to both domains.

4. Introspection is not a separate faculty revealing a private mental realm but simply attention directed at certain events.

5. The subject or ego is not a substantive entity but a logical fiction constructed from experiences.

6. Belief is a quality of certain mental occurrences, not a relation between a mind and a proposition.

7. Desire is to be analyzed in terms of behavior and discomfort cycles, not as a primitive mental act.

8. Images differ from sensations in their causes and effects, not in their intrinsic nature.

9. Memory is not direct acquaintance with the past but present images accompanied by a feeling of pastness.

10. Meaning is constituted by the causal relations between words and what they signify, not by mental acts of meaning.

11. Words acquire meaning through association with objects and situations, not through private definitions.

12. Thought can occur without language, though language greatly extends its scope and precision.

13. There is no act of consciousness distinct from its objects; consciousness is adverbial, not substantival.

14. The traditional distinction between mental acts and their contents is spurious.

15. Behaviorism is partially correct: much of what we call mental can be analyzed in behavioral terms.

16. Behaviorism is partially incorrect: it cannot account for images, which are genuine mental particulars.

17. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to present sensations and images.

18. Knowledge of the external world and other minds is entirely inferential.

19. Propositions are not entities; what exists are propositional attitudes, which are complex psychological facts.

20. Imagination consists of images that are copies of past sensations, operating under different causal laws.

21. The distinction between true and false beliefs lies in their correspondence or non-correspondence with facts.

22. Emotions are complex states involving sensations, images, and bodily feelings.

23. Will is not a special faculty but desire plus belief that action will achieve the desired end.

24. Habit, not reason, governs most human behavior.

25. Instinct is inherited habit, modified by experience but not created by it.

26. Perception is not passive reception but active construction involving inference and interpretation.

27. The "self" is a series of experiences connected by memory and causal continuity, not a persisting substance.

28. There is no pure ego or transcendental subject underlying experience.

29. Mental events are distinguished from physical events by their causal laws, not by their intrinsic nature.

30. Mnemic causation (where past events influence present behavior without intermediate links) is fundamental to psychology.

31. Association of ideas is a real psychological law but does not fully explain the structure of thought.

32. Attention is selective response, not a special mental power directed by a homunculus.

33. Pleasure and pain are qualities of sensations, not separate mental entities.

34. The "intentionality" of mental states (their aboutness) reduces to causal and associative relations.

35. Language is a social phenomenon; meaning is public, not private.

36. Understanding a word consists in having appropriate images or behavioral responses associated with it.

37. General ideas are not abstract entities but habits of response to similarities among particulars.

38. Judgment is a complex of sensations, images, and feelings, not a unique mental act relating a mind to a proposition.

39. Truth is a property of beliefs, consisting in their correspondence with facts.

40. Facts are not propositions but arrangements of particulars that make propositions true or false.

41. The unconscious exists: mental causation can occur without conscious awareness.

42. Dreams are wish-fulfillments, as Freud claimed, though his specific theories require modification.

43. The analysis of mind requires both introspective and behavioral data; neither alone suffices.

44. Physics and psychology study the same neutral events from different perspectives and with different groupings.

45. There are no purely mental substances; the mind is a construction out of events that also constitute the body.

46. Personal identity over time is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing affair.

47. The feeling of familiarity is a distinct mental quality that can attach to any object of experience.

48. Vagueness is essential to most thought and language; precision is the exception, not the rule.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903)

1. Pure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form "p implies q" where p and q contain only logical constants and variables.

2. Mathematics and logic are identical; mathematics is simply logic developed to a higher degree.

3. All mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of purely logical concepts.

4. All mathematical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms.

5. The natural numbers can be defined as classes of similar classes.

6. Zero is the class of all empty classes.

7. One is the class of all unit classes.

8. A cardinal number is the class of all classes similar (equinumerous) to a given class.

9. Similarity between classes is defined by the existence of a one-to-one correspondence.

10. The successor relation among numbers is definable in purely logical terms.

11. Mathematical induction is derivable from the definition of natural numbers, not an independent axiom.

12. Infinity is a logical possibility and presents no inherent contradiction.

13. The actual infinite exists in mathematics; potential infinity is an inadequate substitute.

14. Fractions and real numbers can be constructed from natural numbers using logical operations.

15. Real numbers are best defined as segments (Dedekind cuts) of the rational number series.

16. Continuity is a property of series, definable without appeal to intuition.

17. The calculus can be made rigorous through the arithmetization of analysis; infinitesimals are eliminable.

18. Limits involve no metaphysical notion of "approaching"; they are definable in static terms.

19. Geometry is a branch of pure mathematics when studied abstractly, apart from physical space.

20. Projective geometry is more fundamental than metric geometry.

21. Space as studied by geometry is not necessarily physical space.

22. Different geometries (Euclidean, non-Euclidean) are equally consistent; which describes physical space is empirical.

23. Points, lines, and planes are logical constructions, not intuited simples.

24. Order is a fundamental logical concept not reducible to anything simpler.

25. Asymmetrical relations are essential to mathematics and cannot be eliminated.

26. Relations are as fundamental as classes; neither can be reduced to the other.

27. A relation-in-intension is distinct from the class of ordered pairs that constitutes its extension.

28. Serial order depends on transitive, asymmetrical, and connected relations.

29. The concept of "between" is fundamental to the theory of order.

30. Dense series (between any two terms there is another) are central to analysis.

31. Compact series and continuous series must be carefully distinguished.

32. Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers is logically sound and mathematically indispensable.

33. There are different sizes of infinity; some infinite sets are larger than others.

34. The power set of any set has greater cardinality than the original set.

35. The continuum is larger than the set of natural numbers (uncountably infinite).

36. Ordinal numbers differ from cardinal numbers and are essential for well-ordered sets.

37. A well-ordered set is one in which every non-empty subset has a least element.

38. The theory of types is needed to avoid logical contradictions.

39. Classes and individuals belong to different logical types.

40. No class can be a member of itself without generating contradiction.

41. The class of all classes is an illegitimate totality.

42. Propositions about "all propositions" must be interpreted with care to avoid paradox.

43. Russell's paradox (the class of all classes not members of themselves) shows naive set theory is inconsistent.

44. Denoting concepts are essential to understanding how general propositions work.

45. "All," "some," "any," and "the" function differently and must be carefully distinguished.

46. Definite descriptions ("the so-and-so") denote even when nothing satisfies them (in a sense).

47. Propositional functions are more fundamental than propositions.

48. A propositional function becomes a proposition when a value is assigned to its variable.

49. Variables range over types; unrestricted variables lead to paradox.

50. Implication is the fundamental logical relation from which others are derivable.

51. Material implication differs from formal implication (which involves variables).

52. Logical constants include implication, negation, disjunction, and the notion of a propositional function.

53. Propositions are objective entities, not mental acts or sentences.

54. True and false are indefinable properties of propositions.

55. Facts are complexes consisting of terms united by relations.

56. Every proposition is either true or false (bivalence holds).

57. Identity is a relation, though a peculiar one that holds only between a thing and itself.

58. Classes are logical fictions; talk of classes is reducible to talk of propositional functions.

59. The null class exists and is unique.

60. The universal class for a given type includes all entities of that type.

61. Class membership and class inclusion are fundamentally different relations.

62. Arithmetic can be derived entirely from logic without appeal to intuition.

63. Peano's axioms for arithmetic can be proven from logical definitions.

64. Addition is definable as an operation on cardinal numbers without appeal to intuition.

65. Multiplication is definable logically in terms of one-many relations.

66. Exponentiation is the number of ways of correlating two classes.

67. Subtraction and division are not always possible within the natural numbers; this motivates extensions.

68. Negative numbers and rationals are constructed as ordered pairs of natural numbers.

69. Zero and one are not successive in any metaphysically deep sense; their relation is logical.

70. Mathematical existence means logical consistency; no other existence is required.

71. Existence in mathematics is not spatio-temporal existence.

72. Definitions in mathematics are always explicit; implicit definition is a confusion.

73. Axioms are not self-evident truths but primitive propositions from which others follow.

74. The choice of axioms is partly conventional but constrained by logical requirements.

75. Proof in mathematics is deduction from axioms and definitions using logical rules.

76. Symbolic logic is an essential tool for achieving rigor in mathematics.

77. Ordinary language is systematically misleading about logical form.

78. The subject-predicate form of ordinary grammar does not reveal logical structure.

79. Relational propositions cannot be reduced to subject-predicate form.

80. Plurality is a fundamental logical concept; monism about relations is false.

81. External relations are real; not all relations are reducible to properties of their terms.

82. Bradley's regress against relations fails; relations are genuine constituents of facts.

83. Wholes are not always prior to their parts; logical atomism is defensible.

84. Analysis does not falsify; complex entities are genuinely composed of simpler ones.

85. The part-whole relation differs from set membership and must not be confused with it.

86. Extensive magnitude is analyzable in terms of the part-whole relation.

87. Intensive magnitude presents philosophical difficulties not fully resolved by logic alone.

88. Motion is analyzable as a function from times to positions; Zeno's paradoxes are soluble.

89. Zeno's paradoxes rest on confusions about infinity and continuity that modern analysis resolves.

90. Time, like space, can be represented by a continuous series of instants.

91. Instants are logical constructions from events or other temporal relations.

92. Change is analyzable as different properties at different times; no contradiction arises.

93. Causation is not a logical relation; it is not part of pure mathematics.

94. Necessity in mathematics is logical necessity, not causal or metaphysical necessity.

95. Modality (possibility, necessity) in mathematics reduces to consistency and derivability.

96. Nominalism about universals is false; relations and properties are genuine entities.

97. Universals exist independently of their instances; Platonism about mathematical objects is correct.

98. Classes, numbers, and relations are abstract objects with genuine being.

99. Philosophy must use the methods of logic and analysis, not speculation or intuition.

100. The foundations of mathematics require philosophical clarification that only logic can provide.


POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921) [CONTINUED]

49. The word "mental" should be defined by the causal laws governing certain events, not by reference to a special substance.

50. Cognition is not a unique relation between mind and object but a complex of causally connected events.

51. The "given" in experience is not raw sensation but already contains interpretive elements.

52. Perception involves habits built up from past experience that shape how we respond to stimuli.

53. There is no sharp boundary between perception and hallucination; both are causally explicable.

54. The external reference of sensations is not intrinsic to them but added by belief and habit.

55. Sensations do not inherently point beyond themselves to external objects; this reference is constructed.

56. Images can be mistaken for sensations, particularly in cases of vivid imagination or hallucination.

57. The privacy of mental life is exaggerated; much of what we call private is publicly inferrable.

58. Other minds are known by analogy with our own case, supported by behavioral evidence.

59. Animals possess minds in the same sense humans do; the difference is one of degree, not kind.

60. Infant minds develop through the gradual organization of initially chaotic sensations.

61. Expectation is a present mental state with future reference, analyzable without postulating future entities.

62. Surprise occurs when expectations built from habit are violated by present sensation.

63. Recognition is a present feeling, not a comparison between present perception and stored memory image.

64. The feeling of knowing differs from actual knowledge; one can feel certain yet be wrong.

65. Concepts are not abstract objects grasped by intellect but habits of using words similarly.

66. Abstract ideas are verbal habits, not mental pictures of general qualities.

67. The meaning of a word is not an image but the entire system of reactions the word produces.

68. Sentences, not words, are the primary units of meaning.

69. A word in isolation has only "dictionary meaning"; full meaning requires sentential context.

70. Logical words ("not," "or," "all") cannot be understood through images; their meaning is functional.

71. Propositional attitudes differ in their behavioral and physiological manifestations, not in relating to different abstract entities.

72. Doubt is a genuine mental state distinct from both belief and disbelief.

73. Questioning is a mental state with its own distinctive feeling-tone and behavioral expression.

74. Error arises from treating images as sensations or from inappropriate habitual inferences.

75. Negative facts do not exist; negation is a feature of propositions and beliefs, not of reality.

76. True beliefs are those whose behavioral consequences succeed; false beliefs lead to surprise and frustration.

77. Inference is primarily a process of habit, not a conscious application of logical rules.

78. Reasoning is serial association constrained by habitual patterns of connection.

79. Logic describes ideal inference; psychology describes actual inference, which often departs from the ideal.

80. Instinct is modified by experience much more readily in humans than in lower animals.

81. The greater plasticity of human instinct explains the greater role of learning in human life.

82. Imitation is a fundamental mechanism by which habits spread through a community.

83. Sympathy is the tendency to feel emotions similar to those we perceive in others.

84. Social feeling develops from primitive sympathy modified by experience and habit.

85. Language is the primary vehicle by which individual experience becomes social.

86. Thought without language is imagistic and imprecise; language makes abstract thought possible.

87. Inner speech (verbal imagery) is central to adult human cognition.

88. Children think in images before they think in words; verbal thought is a later development.

89. The meaning of a word for an individual depends on that individual's history of associations.

90. Definitions in ordinary language differ from definitions in logic; the former are always somewhat vague.

91. Vague beliefs can be true; precision is not required for truth.

92. Emotional associations attach to words and color our beliefs about what the words denote.

93. Propaganda works by exploiting the emotional associations of words rather than their cognitive content.

94. Desire is essentially connected with discomfort and the activity aimed at removing it.

95. The object of desire is often unknown to the desiring subject until satisfaction is achieved.

96. Purpose is analyzable in terms of desire and belief without postulating a separate faculty of will.

97. Pleasure accompanies the satisfaction of desire; it is not itself the object of desire.

98. Displeasure accompanies the frustration of desire and drives behavior aimed at alleviating it.

99. The James-Lange theory of emotion is substantially correct: emotions are largely constituted by bodily feelings.

100. Fear, anger, and other emotions are best understood as patterns of bodily sensation plus behavioral tendency.

101. Consciousness admits of degrees; there is no sharp line between conscious and unconscious processes.

102. The unconscious influences behavior through habits and associations of which we are unaware.

103. Forgetting is not the destruction of memory traces but the inhibition of their influence.

104. Repression is a real phenomenon; some memories are actively prevented from influencing consciousness.

105. The "censor" of psychoanalysis can be understood in terms of conflicting habit systems.

106. Dreams draw on desires that are suppressed during waking life.

107. The apparent irrationality of dreams reflects the loosening of habitual constraints on association.

108. Sleep reduces the influence of present sensation, allowing memory and imagination freer play.

109. Attention involves the selective enhancement of certain stimuli and the inhibition of others.

110. Concentration is sustained attention maintained by interest or effort.

111. Fatigue in mental work is primarily fatigue of attention, not of any cognitive faculty.

112. The stream of consciousness is not a single unified flow but a complex of interacting processes.

113. The feeling of activity is a genuine component of experience, accompanying effortful mental work.

114. Conation (striving) is a real feature of mental life, not reducible to mere sensation.

115. The self is not the cause of mental processes but their result; it is constructed, not given.

116. Self-consciousness is awareness of certain mental events, not awareness of a substantial ego.

117. The unity of mind is functional, not substantial; it consists in the integration of habits.

118. Split personality cases show that the unity of mind can break down; it is not metaphysically guaranteed.

119. Personal identity is constituted by memory continuity and bodily continuity, not by a soul.

120. Death is the termination of the causal series that constitutes a mind; no further existence is implied.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921) [CONTINUED]

121. Sensations are caused by stimuli external to the nervous system; images are caused by processes within it.

122. The distinction between sensation and image is causal, not introspectively infallible.

123. Centrally-caused images and peripherally-caused sensations may be qualitatively indistinguishable.

124. Hallucinations are images mistaken for sensations due to their abnormal vividness or context.

125. The prototype of all images is the memory image, which copies past sensation.

126. Imagination operates by recombining elements derived from past sensations.

127. Creative imagination does not produce genuinely new elements but only novel combinations.

128. The laws of association (contiguity, similarity) govern the sequence of images in thought.

129. Association by contiguity is the fundamental law; association by similarity derives from it.

130. Similarity itself is not a simple relation but depends on partial identity of constituents.

131. Conditioned reflexes (Pavlov) illustrate the mechanism of association in its simplest form.

132. Learning is the modification of behavior through the formation of new associative connections.

133. Knowledge of universals reduces to the habit of responding similarly to similar particulars.

134. There are no abstract ideas over and above particular images used in a general way.

135. Berkeley was right that all ideas are particular; he erred in thinking this undermines general knowledge.

136. Generality resides in the use of an image, not in any intrinsic property of the image itself.

137. Words can function as substitutes for images, serving the same role in thought.

138. Much adult thought proceeds via words alone, without accompanying imagery.

139. Verbal thinking is more precise and controllable than imagistic thinking.

140. The behaviorist can explain verbal behavior but not the images that accompany it.

141. Images are the chief evidence against pure behaviorism as a complete psychology.

142. Introspective reports are behavioral data; they do not give privileged access to a private realm.

143. What introspection reports is influenced by theory and expectation; it is not infallible.

144. The existence of images is established by their causal efficacy, not by introspective certainty.

145. After-images prove that sensory experience can occur without external stimuli.

146. Eidetic imagery in some individuals shows that images can have sensory vividness.

147. The difference between imagining and perceiving lies in causal context, not phenomenal quality.

148. Beliefs are true when they are suitably related to facts that would verify them.

149. Verification is the behavioral test by which true and false beliefs are distinguished.

150. The pragmatic theory of truth captures something important but must be refined.

151. Truth is not constituted by usefulness but is reliably correlated with it.

152. False beliefs tend to produce actions that fail, which is why truth matters practically.

153. The correspondence theory of truth is correct but must be stated in terms of structural isomorphism.

154. A belief corresponds to a fact when there is a structural similarity between belief-components and fact-components.

155. Facts are not propositions but complexes of particulars in relation.

156. Negative propositions are made true by positive facts plus the non-existence of certain other facts.

157. General propositions are made true by conjunctions of particular facts.

158. Existence-propositions assert that a propositional function is sometimes true.

159. Knowledge is a species of belief but requires additional conditions beyond truth.

160. Knowledge requires appropriate causal connection between belief and fact.

161. True belief accidentally arrived at does not constitute knowledge.

162. Degrees of belief are psychologically real and influence behavior accordingly.

163. Assertion expresses a high degree of belief; questioning expresses suspended belief.

164. Memory-knowledge is as direct as any knowledge can be, though not infallible.

165. The pastness of a remembered event is not a relation we perceive but a quality we feel.

166. Memory can be mistaken about whether an event occurred, not just about its details.

167. Deja vu illustrates that the feeling of familiarity can attach to genuinely novel experiences.

168. Recognition-memory differs from recall; one can recognize without being able to recall.

169. Habit-memory (knowing how) differs from explicit memory (knowing that).

170. Skills are retained in habit-memory even when explicit memory of learning them is lost.

171. The past is not directly present to memory; what is present is a present image with past reference.

172. The reference to the past is constituted by belief, not by any intrinsic feature of the memory-image.

173. Expectation involves present imagery with future reference, structured analogously to memory.

174. The future-reference of expectation is also constituted by belief attached to present images.

175. Temporal orientation (past, present, future) is imposed on experience by belief, not directly sensed.

176. The specious present is the span of time experienced as "now," varying with attention and context.

177. Succession within the specious present is directly experienced; succession beyond it is inferred.

178. The feeling of duration is a genuine datum, though judgments of duration are often inaccurate.

179. Time perception depends on rhythm, change, and the fullness or emptiness of experienced content.

180. Boredom lengthens experienced time; interest shortens it.

181. Perception is never instantaneous; it always occupies a finite span of the specious present.

182. The construction of objective time from experienced temporal relations is a logical achievement.

183. Temporal relations in physics are inferred from, not directly given in, experience.

184. The privacy of temporal experience contrasts with the publicity of physical time.

185. Spatial perception is constructed from sensory cues interpreted through habit.

186. The correlation of visual, tactile, and kinaesthetic data creates the perception of external space.

187. Depth perception is learned, not innate; it results from experience with movement and touch.

188. The thing seen and the thing touched are identified through habitual correlation, not direct perception.

189. Perceptual constancy (size, shape, color) results from habitual interpretation, not raw sensation.

190. We perceive things, not sensations; sensations are discovered by subsequent analysis.

191. Common sense objects are logical constructions from sensory particulars.

192. The common sense world is a pragmatic construction useful for action, not a metaphysical given.

193. Science reconstructs the common sense world using inferences from sensory data.

194. Neither common sense nor science gives the ultimate reality; both are constructions.

195. Philosophy must analyze constructions to discover the elements from which they are built.

196. The method of logical analysis reveals the structure hidden beneath ordinary speech and thought.

197. Analysis does not destroy its object but clarifies its components and relations.

198. Synthesis from analyzed elements recreates the original whole with added understanding.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903) [CONTINUED]

101. The notion of "class" is fundamental to mathematics and cannot be defined in terms of anything more primitive.

102. A class is wholly determined by its members; classes with the same members are identical.

103. The null class is not nothing; it is a genuine class that happens to have no members.

104. The class of all entities is a legitimate notion within any single type but not across types.

105. Intensional and extensional definitions of classes must be carefully distinguished.

106. Two propositional functions may be materially equivalent yet intensionally distinct.

107. The extension of a propositional function is the class of arguments satisfying it.

108. Predicates do not name classes; the relation between predicate and class is indirect.

109. Not every grammatical predicate corresponds to a genuine propositional function.

110. Self-referential propositional functions must be excluded to avoid paradox.

111. The hierarchy of types applies to propositional functions as well as to classes.

112. A propositional function cannot take itself as argument without type violation.

113. Quantification ("all," "some") ranges over a determinate type, not over everything whatsoever.

114. Unrestricted quantification leads to the paradoxes that afflict naive logic.

115. The theory of types is the only known solution to the logical paradoxes.

116. The vicious circle principle forbids defining an entity in terms of a totality containing it.

117. Impredicative definitions are those violating the vicious circle principle and must be rejected.

118. The ancestral relation (transitive closure) is definable in purely logical terms.

119. Mathematical induction is a consequence of defining natural numbers via the ancestral of succession.

120. Finite and infinite are definable without appeal to intuition or counting.

121. A class is infinite if and only if it is similar to a proper subclass of itself (Dedekind's definition).

122. Finite classes cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with proper subclasses.

123. The axiom of infinity asserts the existence of at least one infinite class.

124. Whether the axiom of infinity is a logical truth is uncertain; it may be an empirical hypothesis.

125. The existence of infinite classes cannot be proven from pure logic alone.

126. Denumerable infinity (aleph-null) is the smallest infinite cardinal.

127. The rational numbers are denumerable; they can be counted by the natural numbers.

128. The real numbers are non-denumerable; no enumeration can exhaust them.

129. Cantor's diagonal argument proves the non-denumerability of the continuum.

130. The power of the continuum exceeds the power of the natural numbers.

131. Whether there is an intermediate infinity between aleph-null and the continuum is undecided (continuum hypothesis).

132. Ordinal arithmetic differs from cardinal arithmetic; order matters for ordinals.

133. The ordinal of the natural numbers is omega, the first transfinite ordinal.

134. Ordinals beyond omega are generated by the successor operation and limit operations.

135. Well-ordering is essential to the theory of ordinals; not all sets can be well-ordered without the axiom of choice.

136. The axiom of choice asserts that for any collection of non-empty sets, a selection function exists.

137. The axiom of choice is independent of the other axioms; its status is philosophically controversial.

138. Multiplicative axiom and axiom of choice are equivalent formulations of the same principle.

139. Many important mathematical theorems depend on the axiom of choice.

140. Zermelo's well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice.

141. The theory of selections and the theory of relations are intimately connected.

142. A relation is asymmetric if it never holds both ways between distinct terms.

143. A relation is transitive if whenever it holds from a to b and b to c, it holds from a to c.

144. A relation is connected if for any two distinct terms, it holds one way or the other.

145. Serial relations are transitive, asymmetric, and connected.

146. Every series determines an order among its terms.

147. Two series are similar if there is a one-one relation preserving order between them.

148. The ordinal number of a series is what all similar series have in common.

149. Between any two rational numbers there is another; the rationals are dense.

150. The real numbers fill the "gaps" among the rationals; they are continuous.

151. Dedekind's definition of continuity requires that every cut determines a real number.

152. Cantor's definition of continuity involves limits of sequences.

153. The two definitions of continuity are equivalent for the real number system.

154. Compact series are those where between any two terms there is a third; density plus other conditions.

155. Continuous series satisfy compactness plus Dedekind's cut condition.

156. The order type of the rational numbers is called eta.

157. The order type of the real numbers is called theta.

158. Distinct well-ordered series with the same ordinal number are similar.

159. Not every dense series is continuous; the rationals are dense but not continuous.

160. Limits are definable in terms of segments and their boundary elements.

161. The notion of limit involves no reference to motion or temporal approach.

162. Weierstrass's arithmetization of analysis eliminates geometric and kinetic intuitions.

163. Infinitesimals are logically unnecessary; limits accomplish all that infinitesimals were supposed to do.

164. The calculus is entirely explicable in terms of the theory of limits and real numbers.

165. Derivatives are limits of difference quotients, not ratios of infinitesimals.

166. Integrals are limits of sums, not sums of infinitely small quantities.

167. Continuous functions are those where small changes in input produce small changes in output.

168. Uniform continuity differs from pointwise continuity and is required for some theorems.

169. A function is a many-one relation assigning to each argument exactly one value.

170. Functions are not processes or operations but static correlations.

171. The domain of a function is the class of arguments; the range is the class of values.

172. Composition of functions is itself a function; functions are closed under composition.

173. Inverse functions exist only for one-one functions.

174. The identity function leaves every argument unchanged.

175. Functions can take functions as arguments; this generates a hierarchy of function types.

176. Predicative functions are those definable without reference to totalities of functions.

177. The ramified theory of types classifies functions by their order as well as their type.

178. Reducibility axiom asserts that every function is equivalent to a predicative function.

179. The reducibility axiom is philosophically dubious but mathematically convenient.

180. Arithmetic is independent of geometry; numbers do not depend on spatial intuition.

181. Geometry without arithmetic is possible; relational structures suffice.

182. The parallel postulate is independent of the other Euclidean axioms.

183. Non-Euclidean geometries are consistent if Euclidean geometry is consistent.

184. Which geometry describes physical space is an empirical, not a priori, question.

185. Pure geometry studies abstract structures; applied geometry studies physical space.

186. Metric geometry presupposes projective geometry; distance is definable projectively.

187. Projective geometry is the most fundamental form of geometry.

188. Descriptive geometry deals with order and betweenness without metrical notions.

189. Topology studies properties invariant under continuous deformation.

190. Dimensionality is a topological invariant; a line cannot be continuously mapped onto a plane bijectively.

191. Points may be defined as classes of nested volumes or as limits of convergent sequences.

192. Lines may be defined as classes of points satisfying certain order relations.

193. Planes and higher-dimensional spaces are constructed analogously.

194. Space is relational, not substantial; it consists of relations among objects.

195. Absolute space (Newton) and absolute motion are metaphysically indefensible.

196. Motion is change of spatial relations over time.

197. Zeno's dichotomy paradox is resolved by the mathematical theory of convergent series.

198. Zeno's Achilles paradox confuses the infinite number of steps with infinite time.

199. Zeno's arrow paradox confuses instantaneous velocity with lack of motion.

200. Zeno's stadium paradox rests on confusion about relative and absolute motion.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903) [CONTINUED]

201. The concept of magnitude is distinct from the concept of number; magnitudes may be non-numerical.

202. Extensive magnitudes have parts that are themselves magnitudes of the same kind.

203. Intensive magnitudes (like temperature or brightness) admit of degree but not of spatial addition.

204. Measurement assigns numbers to magnitudes by comparing them with a unit.

205. The choice of unit is arbitrary; what is objective is the ratio between magnitudes.

206. Equal magnitudes are those bearing the same ratio to the unit.

207. Comparison of magnitudes presupposes a serial order among them.

208. Not all magnitudes are commensurable; incommensurables require the theory of real numbers.

209. The discovery of incommensurables by the Greeks was a crisis for ancient mathematics.

210. Dedekind's theory of cuts resolves the problem of incommensurables rigorously.

211. Quantity and quality are not contradictory; qualities may vary in degree.

212. The distinction between quantity and quality is not absolute but relative to context.

213. Counting presupposes the ability to distinguish units and to correlate them one-to-one.

214. The act of counting is psychological; the numbers counted are not.

215. Numbers are discovered, not invented; they are independent of mental acts.

216. Nominalism about numbers is refuted by the objectivity of mathematical truth.

217. Psychologism in logic confuses the laws of thought with the laws of valid inference.

218. Logic is normative for thought but not constituted by thought.

219. The laws of logic hold independently of whether anyone thinks them.

220. Logical truths are true in all possible worlds; they have maximum generality.

221. Logical constants are topic-neutral; they apply to all subject matters.

222. Material implication is the weakest form of implication; it requires only truth-value connection.

223. Strict implication would require necessary connection, but necessity is problematic.

224. Paradoxes of material implication are merely counterintuitive, not genuinely paradoxical.

225. A false proposition materially implies any proposition; this is logically correct if odd.

226. A true proposition is materially implied by any proposition; equally correct and odd.

227. Formal implication generalizes material implication over all values of a variable.

228. "All A are B" is a formal implication: for all x, if x is A then x is B.

229. The existential import of universal propositions is zero; "all unicorns are white" is vacuously true.

230. Particular propositions ("some A are B") do have existential import.

231. The traditional square of opposition must be revised in light of modern logic.

232. Subalternation fails when the universal is vacuously true but the particular requires existence.

233. Contraposition is valid for material implication: if p implies q, then not-q implies not-p.

234. Transposition (contraposition) is a fundamental inference rule.

235. Modus ponens is the fundamental rule of detachment: from p and p-implies-q, infer q.

236. Modus tollens follows from modus ponens plus contraposition.

237. Hypothetical syllogism chains implications: if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r.

238. Disjunctive syllogism allows inference from "p or q" and "not p" to q.

239. Disjunction in logic is inclusive: "p or q" is true if either or both are true.

240. Exclusive disjunction is definable from inclusive disjunction and negation.

241. Conjunction is true only when both conjuncts are true.

242. Negation reverses truth value; double negation returns the original value.

243. The law of excluded middle holds: every proposition is either true or false.

244. The law of non-contradiction holds: no proposition is both true and false.

245. These laws are not psychological generalizations but logical necessities.

246. Logical necessity is distinct from causal necessity; logic does not depend on natural law.

247. Logical truths are analytic; they are true in virtue of meaning alone.

248. The analytic-synthetic distinction is fundamental to understanding mathematics.

249. Mathematical truths are analytic, not synthetic a priori as Kant held.

250. Kant was wrong that mathematics requires pure intuition; logic suffices.

251. Arithmetic does not depend on the intuition of time, contra Kant.

252. Geometry does not depend on the intuition of space when considered purely formally.

253. The synthetic a priori is an unnecessary hypothesis; logicism eliminates it.

254. Mill was wrong that mathematical truths are empirical generalizations.

255. Mathematical necessity cannot be explained by habitual association.

256. The certainty of mathematics exceeds that of any empirical science.

257. Mathematical truths are known a priori, though the process of discovery may be empirical.

258. Discovery is psychological; justification is logical—the two must not be confused.

259. Axioms are not self-evident starting points but propositions chosen for their deductive fertility.

260. Different axiomatizations of the same theory may be equally legitimate.

261. The primitives of a theory are those notions not defined within the theory.

262. Some notions must be taken as primitive to avoid infinite regress of definitions.

263. Definition is the introduction of a new symbol as shorthand for a complex expression.

264. Definitions are theoretically eliminable; they add convenience, not content.

265. Real definitions (of things) differ from nominal definitions (of words).

266. Mathematics deals primarily with nominal definitions; real definitions are philosophical.

267. Philosophical analysis seeks real definitions of fundamental concepts.

268. Analysis terminates in indefinables known by acquaintance.

269. Logical constants are among the indefinables; they cannot be further analyzed.

270. The concept of "term" is the most general concept; everything thinkable is a term.

271. Terms include things, concepts, relations, propositions, and classes.

272. Every term has being; not every term has existence (spatio-temporal location).

273. Being is wider than existence; numbers have being but do not exist in space and time.

274. The distinction between being and existence is metaphysically fundamental.

275. Existence in the logical sense means being the value of a variable satisfying a propositional function.

276. "There exists an x such that..." is the existential quantifier.

277. The existential quantifier is definable in terms of the universal quantifier and negation.

278. The universal quantifier is not a conjunction; it applies even to infinite domains.

279. Quantifiers bind variables; a bound variable is not a name.

280. Free variables make a proposition into a propositional function.

281. The substitution of constants for free variables yields a determinate proposition.

282. The scope of a quantifier must be precisely delimited to avoid ambiguity.

283. Scope distinctions resolve many apparent puzzles about quantification.

284. Descriptions ("the so-and-so") are incomplete symbols requiring contextual definition.

285. Descriptions do not function as names; they are quantificational constructions.

286. "The present King of France is bald" is false, not meaningless, because the description is empty.

287. Existence is not a predicate; "exists" is properly expressed by the existential quantifier.

288. The ontological argument fails because existence cannot be included in a concept.

289. Concepts are not in the mind; they are objective entities that minds can grasp.

290. Grasping a concept is a relation between a mind and an abstract entity.

291. Abstract entities are not created by abstraction; they exist independently.

292. Abstraction is a psychological process; what it discovers is not psychological.

293. Sets are not created by collecting; they exist prior to any mental act.

294. Mathematical objects are eternal and unchanging; they are outside time.

295. Mathematical truths are necessary truths; they could not have been otherwise.

296. Possible worlds are logical possibilities; the actual world is one among many.

297. Logical space contains all possible configurations of objects and relations.

298. Impossibilities are excluded from logical space; they are not even thinkable consistently.

299. Consistency is the criterion of logical possibility.

300. The actual world differs from merely possible worlds by some non-logical feature (existence).

INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL PHILOSOPHY POSITION STATEMENT 

1. Mathematics and logic have the same scope, dealing with objects having certain properties and relations.

2. Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions that if one thing has a certain property and implies another, then the latter has that property.

3. All pure mathematics is a priori and deducible from the general principles of logic.

4. The fact that mathematical propositions appear to deal with material objects is an accidental characteristic of historically contingent symbolism.

5. Mathematical knowledge is not obtained by induction from experience.

6. The solution to the contradictions that plagued traditional infinitesimal calculus lies in the logical theory of infinite number and continuity.

7. Philosophy must analyze the general nature of propositions, propositional functions, classes, and relations to clarify mathematics.

8. Modern mathematical philosophy begins with the realization that number is not a property of aggregates but applies to classes.

9. A philosophical account of number must avoid psychological elements and focus on logical definitions.

10. All traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the primitive ideas and propositions of Principia Mathematica.

11. Three different matters are lumped together under the name “number”: cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, and numbers as exponents (e.g., in “a²”).

12. Cardinal numbers are concerned with “how many” items are in a class.

13. Two classes have the same cardinal number if there is a one-to-one relation between their terms.

14. Cardinal numbers are themselves classes of similar classes.

15. The cardinal number of a class α is the class of all classes similar (equipotent) to α.

16. Zero is the class containing only the null-class.

17. Finite cardinal numbers are those belonging to every inductive class (starting from 0 and closed under the successor relation).

18. The successor of a cardinal number n is the number of the class obtained by adding one new member to a class with n members.

19. Addition of cardinal numbers is defined via disjoint classes and their union.

20. Multiplication of cardinal numbers is defined via the logical product (intersection) of classes and one-to-one correspondence.

21. Dedekind’s definition of infinite classes: a class is infinite if it is similar to a proper part of itself.

22. Reflexive classes (finite) are those not similar to any proper part of themselves.

23. The axiom of infinity is required to guarantee the existence of infinite classes in the actual world.

24. Ordinal similarity: two relations P and Q are ordinally similar if there is a one-to-one relation S correlating their fields such that if P holds between x and y, then Q holds between S(x) and S(y).

25. Ordinal numbers are relation-types under ordinal similarity.

26. The ordinal number of a well-ordered series is the class of all well-ordered series ordinally similar to it.

27. Every well-ordered series has a unique ordinal number.

28. Transfinite ordinal numbers exist beyond the finite ordinals.

29. ω is the ordinal number of the series of finite integers in their natural order.

30. Addition of ordinals is not commutative (e.g., 1 + ω = ω, but ω + 1 ≠ ω).

31. Multiplication of ordinals is also not commutative.

32. The series of ordinals is itself well-ordered and has no maximum.

33. The continuum hypothesis and the problem of finding the number of possible ordinals less than the continuum remain open.

34. A series has continuity if it is Dedekindian (every subclass with a first term has a successor) and compact (every subclass has both a first and last term or is endless in one direction).

35. The rational numbers in order of magnitude form a series that is Dedekindian but not compact.

36. The real numbers in order of magnitude form a perfect series (both Dedekindian and compact).

37. Zermelo’s theorem: every class can be well-ordered if the axiom of choice is assumed.

38. Description is a denoting phrase that denotes an object via a unique property, but the object itself is not a constituent of propositions containing the description.

39. A propositional function φx is any expression containing x that becomes a proposition when a definite value is assigned to x.

40. Propositional functions may be true for all values of x, some values, or no values.

41. The assertion “∃x . φx” means that φx is true for at least one value of x.

42. Formal implication “φx ⊃ ψx” means that for all x, if φx then ψx.

43. Classes are defined extensionally as the collection of all objects satisfying a given propositional function.

44. The null-class is the class of objects satisfying a contradictory propositional function.

45. The universal class is the class of objects satisfying a tautological propositional function.

46. Unit classes are classes containing exactly one member.

47. The relation of a member to its unit class is fundamental and indefinable.

48. Relations are extensional: two relations are identical if they hold between the same pairs.

49. The relative product R|S of two relations is the relation that holds when there is an intermediate term connected by both R and S.

50. The converse of a relation R is the relation that holds in the reverse order.

51. The domain of a relation is the class of terms that have the relation to something.

52. The converse domain is the class of terms to which something has the relation.

53. The field of a relation is the sum of domain and converse domain.

54. A relation is connex when for any two distinct terms in its field, one has the relation to the other or vice versa.

55. Series are relations that are transitive, asymmetrical, and connex in their field.

56. The principle of abstraction states that every many-one relation defines a class of equivalent terms.

57. The axiom of reducibility ensures the existence of predicative functions equivalent to any function.

58. Mathematical induction is valid for finite numbers because they are defined inductively.

59. Infinite collections require new axioms (e.g., axiom of infinity) beyond pure logic.

60. Geometry can be treated purely analytically without reference to space as a separate entity.

61. Points, lines, and planes are logical constructions from relations.

62. The apparent necessity of mathematical propositions is explained by their tautological character.

63. Kant’s synthetic a priori judgments in mathematics are rejected; all mathematical truths are analytic.

64. The philosophy of mathematics must distinguish between the psychological process of discovery and the logical structure of the finished science.

65. Definitions in mathematics are not arbitrary but must preserve the meaning of the defined term in its previous uses.

66. The vicious-circle paradoxes (e.g., Russell’s paradox) are resolved by the theory of types and the hierarchy of propositional functions.

67. Simple type theory arranges objects, functions of individuals, functions of functions, etc., into distinct types.

68. The ramified theory of types further distinguishes orders within each type to avoid impredicative definitions.

69. The no-classes theory eliminates classes as entities by treating statements about classes as statements about propositional functions.

70. Identity is not a relation between objects but a logical device for asserting that two names denote the same object.

71. The statement “Scott is the author of Waverley” expresses an identity, not a relation of predication.

72. Definite descriptions (“the so-and-so”) are incomplete symbols that disappear on logical analysis.

73. The theory of definite descriptions resolves puzzles like “the present King of France is bald.”

74. Scope distinctions in descriptions resolve ambiguities in negation and modality.

75. Mathematics is the science in which we never know what we are talking about nor whether what we say is true (in the sense of being about indefinable primitives).

76. The primitives of logic (e.g., negation, disjunction, universal quantification) suffice to define all mathematical concepts.

77. The reduction of mathematics to logic shows that mathematical certainty rests on logical certainty.

78. Empiricist attempts to derive mathematics from experience fail because mathematical propositions are necessary and universal.

79. The logistic thesis (Frege-Russell) that mathematics is an extension of logic is defended against Poincaré and other critics.

80. Infinity is not a single idea but a hierarchy: infinite cardinals, infinite ordinals, the continuum, etc.

81. The transfinite is as legitimate as the finite once the correct logical definitions are given.

82. The paradoxes of infinity (Galileo, Bolzano) are resolved by distinguishing cardinal and ordinal aspects.

83. Cantor’s theory of transfinite numbers is accepted and integrated into logic.

84. The power-class (set of all subsets) of an infinite set is larger than the set itself.

85. There is no greatest cardinal number.

86. The arithmetic of transfinite cardinals obeys different laws from finite arithmetic (e.g., ℵ₀ + 1 = ℵ₀).

87. The continuum has cardinality 2^ℵ₀, which may or may not equal ℵ₁.

88. Order-types provide a more refined classification than mere cardinality.

89. Well-ordering is not an intrinsic property of series but depends on the choice of ordering relation.

90. The multiplicative axiom (axiom of choice) is independent of other logical principles.

91. Mathematics without the axiom of choice is weaker but still consistent.

92. Physical applications of infinity (e.g., space, time) are philosophically problematic but mathematically legitimate.

93. The logical antinomies show the need for a rigorous theory of types.

94. Impredicative definitions are legitimate if confined within the same type and order via reducibility.

95. The future development of mathematical philosophy lies in further analysis of order, series, and continuity.

96. Mathematics is distinguished from empirical science by its independence from sensory observation.

97. The certainty of mathematics derives from its tautological nature once primitives are granted.

98. Philosophy benefits from mathematical logic by gaining precision and freedom from contradictions.

99. The ultimate primitives of logic remain indefinable, known by acquaintance.

100. The aim of mathematical philosophy is to exhibit mathematics as a consistent, purely deductive system built on the fewest possible primitive ideas and propositions.

HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ITS SCOPE AND LIMITS POSITION STATEMENT 

1. The aim of the book is to examine what can be genuinely known and the degrees of doubt or certainty attaching to different kinds of putative knowledge.

2. Knowledge is divided into two main kinds: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.

3. Knowledge by acquaintance is direct awareness without inference (e.g., sense-data, memory-images, introspection of mental states, and possibly universals).

4. Knowledge by description always depends ultimately on knowledge by acquaintance.

5. Sense-data are the immediate objects of perception; physical objects are inferred from them.

6. Physical objects (tables, chairs, stars) are not known by acquaintance but are logical constructions out of sense-data and sensibilia.

7. The external world is known only as the class of actual and possible sense-data satisfying certain causal laws.

8. Solipsism is logically irrefutable but psychologically incredible.

9. The principle of induction cannot be proved by experience, yet it is presupposed by all empirical knowledge.

10. There are five postulates of scientific inference needed to justify induction and the belief in an external world.

11. The first postulate: the postulate of quasi-permanence (things change slowly).

12. The second postulate: separate causal lines (events have relatively independent causal histories).

13. The third postulate: spatio-temporal continuity in causal chains.

14. The fourth postulate: the structural postulate (similar causes have similar effects).

15. The fifth postulate: the postulate of causality (every event has a cause).

16. These postulates are not logically necessary but are justified pragmatically by the success of science.

17. Memory is not infallible; it provides only probable knowledge.

18. Introspective knowledge of current mental states is the most certain kind of knowledge.

19. Universals (relations such as “before,” “greater than,” “resembles”) are known by acquaintance.

20. All a priori knowledge deals with relations of universals.

21. Logical principles (e.g., law of contradiction) are known by intuition of universals.

22. The law of contradiction is not known to hold in the empirical world with certainty.

23. Probability, not certainty, is the guide in most empirical beliefs.

24. There are two kinds of probability: mathematical (degree of credibility) and empirical (relative frequency).

25. The principle of induction itself has only probabilistic justification.

26. Scientific laws are not known to be true but to be increasingly probable as evidence accumulates.

27. Causality is not a relation between events but a functional relation between kinds of events.

28. Determinism is neither provable nor refutable by science.

29. The concept of “cause” in advanced science is replaced by functional laws.

30. Space and time are not absolute (as Newton thought) nor purely subjective (as Kant thought).

31. Physical space is a construction from perspectival spaces derived from different observers.

32. Einstein’s theory of relativity provides the best current account of space-time.

33. Matter is a logical construction from events and their causal relations.

34. The distinction between mind and matter becomes less sharp when both are constructed from neutral events.

35. Consciousness is not a datum for science; physics can be complete without mentioning it.

36. The causal efficacy of mind (mental causation) remains philosophically problematic.

37. Self-consciousness gives knowledge of the self only as the subject of current experience.

38. The continuity of the self through time is an inference, not a datum.

39. Other minds are known only by analogy from behavior.

40. Knowledge of other minds is probable but not certain.

41. Truth is not coherence nor correspondence in a naive sense.

42. A belief is true when it corresponds to a fact; a fact is whatever makes a belief true.

43. Negative facts and general facts must be admitted to account for false beliefs and general truths.

44. Logical truths are tautologies; they say nothing about the empirical world.

45. Ethical knowledge is not possible in the same sense as scientific knowledge.

46. Value judgments are expressions of desire or emotion, not statements of fact.

47. There is no objective knowledge of good or evil.

48. Aesthetic judgments are subjective in the same way.

49. The distinction between good and evil is rooted in human desires and feelings.

50. Traditional metaphysics (substance, absolute space, God) exceeds the limits of human knowledge.

51. Knowledge of the existence and nature of God is impossible.

52. The cosmological argument, ontological argument, and argument from design all fail.

53. Mystical experience does not yield objective knowledge.

54. Science is limited to structure, not intrinsic qualities.

55. The ultimate constituents of the world (events or whatever) have unknown intrinsic qualities.

56. We know the formal structure of the physical world but not its qualitative nature.

57. Language misleads us into false metaphysics (e.g., subject-predicate form suggests substance).

58. Proper logical analysis dissolves many traditional philosophical problems.

59. The problem of universals is resolved by admitting real universals known by acquaintance.

60. The problem of the one and the many is not a genuine problem once logical types are distinguished.

61. Most philosophical problems arise from confusion of logical types or improper symbolism.

62. Philosophy’s task is analysis, not the discovery of new empirical facts.

63. The value of philosophy lies in enlarging contemplation and diminishing dogmatic assurance.

64. Philosophy frees us from the tyranny of custom and narrow personal interests.

65. The ultimate aim of knowledge is to understand the world as much as possible without false beliefs.

66. Absolute certainty is confined to introspection, logic, and ethics (in a limited sense).

67. In all matters concerning the external world, only probability is attainable.

68. Dogmatism in science, politics, or religion is intellectually dishonest.

69. Intellectual humility is a virtue required by the limitations of human knowledge.

70. The growth of knowledge consists in replacing crude common-sense beliefs with more refined scientific ones.

71. Science progresses by increasing abstraction and generality.

76. Time in physics is a fourth dimension analogous to space.

77. The special theory of relativity abolishes absolute simultaneity.

78. General relativity treats gravitation as curvature of space-time.

79. Quantum mechanics introduces genuine indeterminacy (or at least unpredictability).

80. The principle of indeterminacy (Heisenberg) limits precise simultaneous knowledge of position and velocity.

81. Causality in the strict deterministic sense may not hold at the quantum level.

82. The wave-particle duality shows that ordinary concepts do not fully apply to microphysics.

83. Scientific knowledge is always provisional and subject to revision.

84. The history of science shows repeated overthrow of apparently certain theories.

85. There is no reason to believe that current theories are final.

86. Non-Euclidean geometry destroyed the Kantian view of space as synthetic a priori.

PHILOSOPHY OF LEIBNIZ POSITION STATEMENT 

1. Leibniz’s philosophy is a synthesis of the new mechanical science with the traditional demands of metaphysics.

2. The two fundamental works for understanding Leibniz are the Discourse on Metaphysics (1686) and the Monadology (1714).

3. Leibniz’s system is characterized by extreme rationalism: everything (except God’s free choice of the best) can in principle be demonstrated a priori.

4. The principle of sufficient reason: nothing happens without a sufficient reason why it should be so rather than otherwise.

5. The principle of contradiction: whatever involves a contradiction is false.

6. All analytic truths are governed by the principle of contradiction; all existential truths (except God’s existence) by the principle of sufficient reason.

7. Truths of reason (necessary, demonstrated by contradiction) vs truths of fact (contingent, resolved into identities by infinite analysis).

8. Every true predication is analytic: the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject.

9. In every true proposition the concept of the predicate is included in the concept of the subject (praedicatum inest subiecto).

10. Individual substances have complete individual concepts containing all their predicates past, present, and future.

11. From Adam’s complete concept one could in principle deduce that he would eat the apple.

12. Necessary truths are true in all possible worlds; contingent truths are true only in some.

13. This is the best of all possible worlds: God, being perfect, chose to create the world with the maximum variety compatible with the maximum order.

14. The principle of the identity of indiscernibles: no two substances can be exactly alike and differ only numerically (natura non facit saltus).

15. The principle of continuity: nature makes no leaps.

16. There are no atoms or void; the universe is a plenum.

17. Monads are the true substances: simple, unextended, windowless, indestructible metaphysical points.

18. Each monad is a “living mirror” of the entire universe from its own point of view.

19. Monads have no windows: no monad causally acts upon another.

20. The appearance of interaction is explained by pre-established harmony.

21. God synchronizes all monads from the beginning so that their states correspond perfectly.

22. Perception in monads is the representation of the many in the one.

23. Apperception is perception accompanied by consciousness or reflection.

24. Monads differ in clarity and distinctness of their perceptions.

25. Bare monads have only confused perceptions; animal souls have memory and sensation; rational minds have apperception and reason.

26. Appetition is the internal principle by which a monad passes from one perception to another.

27. Every monad expressesently unfolds its entire future series of states from its own nature.

28. Bodies are phenomena bene fundata: well-founded appearances resulting from the aggregate of monads.

29. Space and time are not substances or absolute containers but orders of phenomena (ideal relations).

30. Space is the order of co-existing phenomena; time the order of successive phenomena.

31. Extension, motion, and shape are only phenomenal, not ultimately real.

32. The vinculum substantiale (substantial chain) was a late, semi-official attempt to reconcile monads with Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist.

33. Leibniz distinguishes three levels of reality: metaphysical (monads), physical (mechanics), and moral (kingdom of grace).

34. The science of dynamics introduces the concept of force (vis viva = mv²) as more fundamental than Cartesian quantity of motion.

35. Active force and passive force correspond at the phenomenal level to the metaphysical perfection and limitation of monads.

36. Leibniz rejects absolute space and time; all motion is relative.

37. The relativity of space refutes Newton’s bucket argument.

38. God is a necessary being whose essence includes existence (ontological argument revived).

39. God’s understanding contains all possible worlds as ideas; His will chooses the best; His power creates it.

40. Possible worlds are infinite in number; only one is actualized.

41. Evil exists because a world containing certain goods necessarily contains some evils.

42. Metaphysical evil (imperfection), physical evil (suffering), and moral evil (sin) are all minimized in the best world.

43. Leibniz’s theodicy: this world has the optimum balance of good over evil.

44. Human freedom is compatibilist: the will is determined by the greatest apparent good, yet acts spontaneously.

45. Spontaneity: every state of a monad follows from its own nature.

46. Freedom requires intelligence, spontaneity, and contingency (inclination without necessity).

47. Leibniz rejects Cartesian mind-body interaction and occasionalism; both imply continual miracles.

48. Pre-established harmony is the most economical and perfect hypothesis.

49. Leibniz’s logic contains the ideal of a characteristica universalis: a universal symbolic language in which all truths could be calculated.

50. The ideal of an ars iudicandi: discovery of truth by mechanical computation from primitive concepts.

51. All concepts are ultimately resolvable into simple primitive ideas (though we do not know them).

52. Leibniz anticipates modern intensional logic by distinguishing necessary from contingent identity.

53. The relation of “inclusion” between concepts is the basis of all demonstration.

54. Leibniz’s mature metaphysics is occasionalist in appearance only; genuine causality is intra-monadic.

55. The monadology solves the continuum problem: there are no extended atoms, only unextended points.

56. Leibniz’s theory of truth is the first explicit correspondence theory based on concept-containment.

57. The New Essays on Human Understanding (written 1704) is a point-by-point critique of Locke.

58. Against Locke: there are innate truths (necessary truths known by the light of reason).

59. “Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi ipse intellectus” – the mind itself is innate.

60. Truths of fact require sensory input; truths of reason are independent of experience.

61. Leibniz defends the reality of substantial forms against the mechanists.

62. Corporeal substance = monad + organic body (secondary matter).

63. Every portion of matter contains infinitely many monads (dominant + subordinate).

64. Death and birth are only enfolding and unfolding of the same monad.

65. Leibniz’s optimism (“best possible world”) was satirized by Voltaire in Candide.

66. The principle of sufficient reason is the foundation of contingency and freedom.

67. Leibniz’s system is the most ambitious attempt to reconcile final causes with efficient causes.

68. The moral world (kingdom of spirits) is governed by God as moral ruler, not merely as architect.

69. Justice is “the charity of the wise” – universal benevolence regulated by reason.

70. Leibniz’s philosophy influenced later German idealism (especially the pre-critical Kant and Herder).

71. The monadology is the culmination of Leibniz’s lifelong attempt to unify Aristotle, Plato, and modern mechanism.

72. Leibniz’s metaphysics is panpsychist: every monad has perception and appetition.

73. The apparent mechanical world is the confused perception of infinitely many monads.

74. Leibniz’s system is deductive in ambition: from a few principles everything else follows.

75. The ultimate reason for the world lies in God’s choice of the richest (most varied) compossible system.

76. Compossibility: not all possibles can coexist in the same world.

77. Each possible world is a maximal compossible set.

78. God’s calculation of the best world is an infinite analysis.

79. Leibniz’s logic contains the distinction between truths whose denial is contradictory and those requiring infinite analysis.

80. The Discourse on Metaphysics marks the first full statement of the complete-concept theory.

81. The correspondence with Arnauld (1686–87) forced Leibniz to clarify the relation of substances to God.

82. Leibniz’s philosophy of language anticipates modern formal semantics.

83. The ideal of the universal characteristic remained unrealized but inspired later symbolic logic.

84. Leibniz’s metaphysics refuses both materialism and dualism by reducing bodies to phenomena.

85. The pre-established harmony extends to mind-body, body-body, and mind-mind relations.

86. Leibniz’s optimism is not naïve; he acknowledges real evil but claims it is outweighed.

87. The principle of sufficient reason forbids brute facts.

88. Every detail of the universe is justified by its contribution to the perfection of the whole.

89. Leibniz’s system is the last great example of Renaissance rationalism before the empirical turn.

90. The monadology offers a metaphysical foundation for the new science while preserving theology and freedom.

91. Leibniz’s philosophy is a grand synthesis: mechanistic physics, scholastic metaphysics, and Christian optimism united by the two great principles (contradiction and sufficient reason).

92. The monad is the modern substitute for the scholastic substantial form.

93. Leibniz’s metaphysics is pluralistic (infinitely many substances) yet tightly unified by divine pre-ordination.

94. The apparent contingency of the world is preserved because the choice of the best is morally necessary, not logically necessary.

95. Leibniz’s God is bound by logical impossibility but free within the realm of the compossible.

96. The system illustrates the power and the limits of rationalist metaphysics.

97. Leibniz’s optimism and theodicy represent the high-water mark of philosophical justification of evil.

98. The monadology remains one of the most ingenious and coherent metaphysical systems ever constructed.

99. Leibniz’s philosophy shows both the grandeur of seventeenth-century rationalism and the internal tensions that would lead to its eighteenth-century collapse.

100. The lasting contribution of Leibniz lies in his logical insights, his relational theory of space-time, his dynamics, and his uncompromising demand for sufficient reason in every domain of knowledge.

A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY POSITION STATEMENT

1. Philosophy arises from wonder and the desire to understand the world without myth.
2. The Milesian philosophers (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes) sought a single material principle underlying all things.
3. Pythagoras discovered the mathematical basis of musical harmony and taught the transmigration of souls.
4. Heraclitus held that everything is in flux (“you cannot step twice into the same river”) and that strife is the father of all things.
5. Parmenides argued that being is one, unchanging, and that plurality and motion are illusions.
6. Zeno’s paradoxes were designed to defend Parmenides by showing the contradictions in motion and plurality.
7. Empedocles introduced four elements (earth, air, fire, water) combined and separated by Love and Strife.
8. Anaxagoras posited Mind (Nous) as the ordering principle and infinitely divisible seeds.
9. The Atomists (Leucippus and Democritus) explained the world mechanically by atoms moving in the void.
10. Protagoras declared “man is the measure of all things” and introduced relativism.
11. Gorgias claimed that nothing exists, or if it does we cannot know it, or if we know it we cannot communicate it.
12. Socrates sought universal definitions, especially of ethical terms, and professed ignorance.
13. The Socratic method is dialectical questioning leading to refutation (elenchus).
14. Socrates was condemned for corrupting the youth and introducing new gods.
15. Plato was deeply influenced by Socrates’ life and death and by Pythagorean mathematics.
16. Plato’s theory of Forms: eternal, immutable, perfect archetypes of which sensible things are imperfect copies.
17. Knowledge is recollection (anamnesis) of the soul’s vision of the Forms before birth.
18. The tripartite soul: reason, spirit, courage.
19. The ideal state in the Republic has three classes (guardians, auxiliaries, producers) mirroring the soul.
20. Justice is each part performing its proper function.
21. Philosophers must become kings or kings philosophers for the state to be just.
22. The Form of the Good is the source of all reality and intelligibility (sun analogy).
23. The divided line distinguishes visible and intelligible realms, opinion and knowledge.
24. The allegory of the cave illustrates the ascent from illusion to knowledge of the Forms.
25. Later Plato (Parmenides, Sophist, Timaeus) modifies the theory of Forms and introduces the Demiurge.
26. Aristotle was Plato’s pupil for twenty years but became a systematic critic.
27. Aristotle rejects separate Forms; universals exist only in things (immanent realism).
28. The four causes: material, formal, efficient, final.
29. Substance is the individual composite of matter and form.
30. The unmoved mover is pure form, thought thinking itself, cause of all motion.
31. The golden mean is the ethical ideal between excess and deficiency.
32. Intellectual virtue (wisdom) is superior to moral virtue (practical wisdom).
33. Contemplation (theoria) is the highest human activity.
34. After Aristotle, philosophy splits into Epicureanism, Stoicism, Skepticism, and Neoplatonism.
35. Epicurus taught atomism, pleasure (ataraxia) as the highest good, and freedom from fear of gods and death.
36. Stoicism (Zeno of Citium, Chrysippus, later Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius) taught living according to nature and reason.
37. The Stoic cosmos is a living, rational, providentially ordered whole.
38. Virtue alone is sufficient for happiness; external goods are indifferent.
39. Skeptics (Pyrrho, Carneades) suspended judgment (epochē) because equal arguments exist on both sides.
40. The Cynics (Diogenes) rejected convention and lived according to nature.
41. Medieval philosophy is dominated by the synthesis of Christianity with Greek thought.
42. Augustine adapts Platonism: evil is absence of good, time is subjective, illumination by God.
43. The problem of universals begins the medieval period: realism vs nominalism.
44. Boethius transmits Greek logic and translates Aristotle’s Organon.
45. The early Middle Ages see the rise of scholasticism.
46. Anselm’s ontological argument: God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived; existence is a perfection.
47. Abelard stresses logic and conceptualism in the universals debate.
48. The twelfth-century Renaissance brings new translations of Aristotle via Arabic sources.
49. Aquinas synthesizes Aristotle with Christianity: faith and reason are compatible.
50. God’s existence proved by the five ways (motion, causation, contingency, degrees, teleology).
51. Essence and existence are distinct in creatures but identical in God.
52. Natural law is the rational creature’s participation in eternal law.
53. Duns Scotus defends the univocity of being and the primacy of will over intellect.
54. Ockham’s nominalism: only individuals exist; universals are mental signs.
55. Ockham’s razor: entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.
56. The late Middle Ages see the decline of scholasticism and the rise of mysticism (Eckhart).
57. The Renaissance revives Platonism (Ficino, Pico della Mirandola) and humanism.
58. The Reformation stresses individual conscience against ecclesiastical authority.
59. Modern philosophy begins with Descartes’s quest for certainty.
60. Descartes’s methodic doubt: doubt everything that can be doubted.
61. Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I am—the first indubitable truth.
62. Clear and distinct ideas are the criterion of truth.
63. God exists because the idea of perfection cannot originate from imperfect me (trademark argument).
64. Dualism: mind (res cogitans) and body (res extensa) are distinct substances.
65. Hobbes is a strict materialist: everything is body in motion.
66. Sensation is motion in the brain; imagination is decaying sense.
67. The state of nature is war of all against all; the social contract creates the sovereign.
68. Spinoza identifies God and Nature (Deus sive Natura).
69. One substance with infinite attributes; only thought and extension known to us.
70. Intellectual love of God is the highest blessedness.
71. Leibniz’s monads are windowless, each mirroring the universe from its own point of view.
72. Pre-established harmony replaces Cartesian interaction.
73. Locke is the founder of British empiricism: the mind at birth is a tabula rasa.
74. All ideas come from sensation or reflection.
75. Primary qualities (shape, motion) really exist in bodies; secondary (color, taste) are powers.
76. Personal identity is continuity of consciousness, not substance.
77. Berkeley denies matter: to be is to be perceived (esse est percipi).
78. Ideas exist only in minds; God guarantees continuity of the world.
79. Hume radicalizes empiricism: all ideas derive from impressions.
80. Causation is not necessary connection but constant conjunction and psychological expectation.
81. The self is a bundle of perceptions; no impression of a permanent self.
82. Reason is slave of the passions; morality is based on sentiment.
83. Kant is awakened from dogmatic slumber by Hume.
84. The Copernican revolution: the mind imposes form (space, time, categories) on experience.
85. Phenomena are appearances; noumena (things-in-themselves) unknowable.
86. The categories (causality, substance) are a priori conditions of experience.
87. The antinomies show that speculative metaphysics leads to contradictions.
88. The moral law is the categorical imperative: act only on maxims universalizable.
89. Postulates of practical reason: freedom, immortality, God.

95. Nietzsche announces the death of God and the advent of nihilism.
96. The will to power is the fundamental drive.
97. The Übermensch creates new values beyond good and evil.
98. Eternal recurrence is the ultimate affirmation of life.
99. Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill) defines good as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.
100. The analytic tradition (Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, logical positivism) seeks clarity through logical analysis and the dissolution of traditional metaphysics.

OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD POSITION STATEMENT

1. The chief thesis of the book is that the external world can be known, but only as a logical construction out of sense-data and sensibilia.

2. Traditional philosophy has failed to prove the existence of an external world independent of perception.

3. The problem of the external world arises from the fact that sense-data are private and dependent on the perceiver.

4. Sense-data are the immediate objects of sensation (colours, sounds, hardnesses, etc.).

5. Sensibilia are unsensed sense-data that exist when no one perceives them.

6. Physical objects (tables, stars) are not identical with sense-data but are logical functions of them.

7. The supreme maxim in scientific philosophising: wherever possible, substitute logical constructions for inferred entities.

8. Ockham’s razor is reinterpreted as the preference for constructions over inferences.

9. Matter is to be replaced by a complex system of perspectives of sense-data.

10. A “perspective” is the class of all sense-data that would be perceived from a given place at a given time.

11. The “place” of a perspective is defined by the similarity relations among its sense-data.

12. Private space (perspectival space) is constructed first from sense-data of one perceiver.

13. The common physical space is a logical construction out of all private spaces.

14. The thing (e.g., a table) is the class of its appearances (all actual and possible aspects).

15. Instantaneous things (momentary perspectives) are logically prior to persisting things.

16. The persisting physical object is the class of all momentary things that belong to its history.

17. Time in the physical world is constructed from the order of appearances within perspectives.

18. Causality is reduced to lawful correlations among sense-data.

19. The principle of causality is replaced by the search for functional laws between stimuli and sensations.

20. Induction is justified by the postulate that the world has a certain kind of uniformity expressible in mathematical form.

21. The external world, as known to science, is a six-dimensional manifold of “events” or “aspects”.

22. Space-time points are logical constructions from overlapping perspectives.

23. The apparent continuity of physical objects is an illusion; reality consists of discrete perspectives.

24. The distinction between mind and matter is replaced by the distinction between different arrangements of the same neutral material (sense-data).

25. Psychology and physics both deal with the same data but group them differently.

26. The self is a logical construction out of its experiences, not a separate substance.

27. Memory is the primary source of belief in past existence of sense-data.

28. Introspection gives us direct acquaintance with our own sense-data and thoughts.

29. Other minds are known by analogy and behavioural correlations.

30. The problem of solipsism is logically unanswerable but practically irrelevant.

31. Traditional realism, idealism, and phenomenalism all fail to solve the problem adequately.

32. Naive realism confuses sense-data with physical objects.

33. Subjective idealism wrongly denies the existence of anything beyond actual sense-data.

34. The new realistic theory avoids both extremes by treating physical objects as classes of appearances.

35. The method of logical constructions is analogous to the way mathematicians define points as classes of volumes.

36. Definition by description replaces inference to unobservable entities.

37. The theory dissolves the traditional dispute between realism and idealism.

38. Science does not need metaphysical matter; it needs only correlations among phenomena.

39. The belief in an independent external world is justified because it yields the simplest and most coherent system.

40. The external world is known only in its formal, structural properties, not in its intrinsic qualities.

41. Sensations are the only particulars we directly know; everything else is constructed.

42. The construction of matter from sense-data is the only way to avoid scepticism without dogmatism.

43. The philosophy of logical analysis (Russell’s own method) is the proper successor to traditional metaphysics.

44. Many traditional problems (substance, causality, the ego) dissolve when analysed correctly.

45. The aim of philosophy is not new positive knowledge but clarification of what science already knows.

46. The book marks the transition from Russell’s earlier Platonic atomism to neutral monism.

47. Neutral monism holds that the ultimate constituents of the world are neither mental nor material.

48. Both minds and physical objects are logical fictions built from the same neutral stuff (sensations and images).

49. Images (memory and imagination) are indistinguishable in quality from sensations but differ in causal origin.

50. The distinction between sensation and image is causal, not intrinsic.

51. The external world is public because different private worlds overlap in their correlations.

52. The “thing” is the set of all perspectives in which a certain similarity structure appears.

53. Motion is analysed as different qualities at different places in different perspectives.

54. The relativity of motion is compatible with the construction of absolute positions via perspectives.

55. Einstein’s special relativity is philosophically acceptable within the logical-construction framework.

56. Space-time is a four-dimensional continuum constructed from ordered relations of perspectives.

57. The traditional problem of the relation of sense-data to physics is solved by identifying physics with the study of perspective structures.

58. The book proposes a complete programme for rebuilding philosophy on the basis of modern logic and sense-data.

59. The external world, as constructed, is exactly what common sense believes in, but justified logically.

60. The new theory gives certainty where traditional arguments gave only probability.

61. The external world is not inferred but defined as the system that makes science possible.

62. Philosophy must adopt the methods of science: analysis, hypothesis, and verification by consequences.

63. The book is a manifesto for the application of logical techniques to traditional epistemological problems.

64. The ultimate goal is to exhibit all legitimate knowledge as derived from acquaintance with particulars (sense-data).

65. The external world is known to exist because its construction is the only way to systematise our sensations coherently.

66. The theory preserves the objectivity of physics while remaining strictly empiricist.

67. The external world is not a cause of sensations but a logical construction out of them.

68. The apparent causal dependence of sensations on objects is reversed: objects are defined in terms of sensations.

69. The book represents the high point of Russell’s “logical analytic” period (1911–1918).

70. The method of logical constructions is the twentieth-century successor to the seventeenth-century search for certainty.

71. The external world, when properly analysed, is neither mental nor material but a logical system of perspectives.

72. The theory dissolves the mind-body problem by constructing both from the same elements.

73. The book aims to place philosophy on a firm scientific foundation while avoiding materialism.

74. The external world is known with logical certainty once the correct definitions are adopted.

75. The entire programme is an application of the theory of definite descriptions and the logic of relations.

76. The construction of the external world is the most thorough attempt ever made to derive realism from pure empiricism.

77. The book marks the culmination of British empiricism in its logical phase.

78. The external world is public, permanent, and independent, yet entirely constructed from private, fleeting sense-data.

79. The theory satisfies both the demands of science and the rigour of philosophical analysis.

80. The ultimate message is optimistic: the external world can be known, and known with certainty, through logical construction.

PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA VOLUME 1 POSITION STATEMENT

1. The work aims to derive the whole of pure mathematics from a small number of primitive ideas and primitive propositions of logic alone.
2. All definitions are purely typographical abbreviations and introduce no new primitive ideas.

4. The theory of apparent variables (quantification) is central to the entire system.
5. A proposition containing an apparent variable is not a complete proposition but becomes one when the variable is given a determinate value.
6. The hierarchy of truth-values and falsity-values replaces traditional subject-predicate logic.
7. The theory of types (simple theory in Volume 1) is introduced to avoid the paradoxes.
8. Individuals, first-order functions, second-order functions, etc., belong to different logical types.
9. A function can only meaningfully take arguments of the next lower type.
10. The vicious-circle principle forbids a function from being defined in terms of a totality that already involves that function.
11. The order of a propositional function is the highest type of its arguments.
12. Predicative functions are those whose order is exactly one higher than their arguments.

31. The class of all x such that φx is defined by “x̂(φx).”

71. The logical construction of points avoids assuming them as primitive.
72. The entire system is free from contradictions discovered in earlier logicist attempts.
73. The ramified theory of types with orders is foreshadowed but not fully used in Volume 1.
74. The axiom of infinity is not asserted as a primitive proposition.

MATHEMATICAL LOGIC AS BASED ON THE THEORY OF TYPES POSITION STATEMENT 

Here is a pure numbered list of 72 distinct positions/claims/theses from Bertrand Russell’s paper “Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types” (1908):

1. All traditional metaphysical paradoxes arise from vicious-circle fallacies.  
2. A function can occur significantly only in its own values, never in the values of functions of lower type.  
3. Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection.  
4. Propositions containing apparent variables are not genuine propositions.  
5. Propositional functions, not propositions, are the fundamental entities of logic.  
6. Every propositional function has a range of significance and a range of truth.  
7. The doctrine of types is indispensable to solve the logical paradoxes.  
8. There is a hierarchy of types: individuals (type 0), classes of individuals (type 1), classes of classes of individuals (type 2), etc.  
9. Propositional functions themselves form a type-hierarchy parallel to the arguments.  
10. A propositional function φx is of type one higher than its argument x.  
11. The relation of an element to a class containing it is of a higher type than the element.  
12. No class can significantly be a member of itself.  
13. The class of all classes is meaningless.  
14. The relation of similarity between relations is of higher type than the related relations.  
15. The paradox of the liar is solved by distinguishing orders of truth and falsehood.  
16. A proposition about “all propositions” is always of higher order than the propositions it concerns.  
17. Propositions containing apparent variables are incomplete symbols with no meaning in isolation.  
18. The axiom of reducibility is required to recover classical mathematics.  
19. For every propositional function there exists a formally equivalent predicative function.  
20. Without the axiom of reducibility, analysis would be impossible.  
21. The axiom of reducibility is not self-evident but is justified by its consequences.  
22. The no-class theory is adopted: classes are incomplete symbols eliminated by contextual definition.  
23. Statements apparently about classes are in reality statements about propositional functions.  
24. The symbol “x ∈ u” is defined contextually via “there exists φ such that u = {x : φx} and φx”.  
25. Identity is defined as indiscernibility by all predicative functions.  
26. The description operator ι is contextual and governed by the theory of definite descriptions.  
27. A description “the so-and-so” has only contextual meaning and is eliminated by Russell’s 1905 method.  
28. The axiom of infinity (existence of infinitely many individuals) is required for arithmetic.  
29. The axiom of infinity is not logically necessary but empirically true.  
30. The multiplicative axiom (axiom of choice) is assumed.  
31. The multiplicative axiom is independent of the other axioms of logic.  
32. Mathematics is reducible to logic provided the axioms of infinity, choice, and reducibility are granted.  
33. The theory of types is ramified: orders within each type are distinguished.  
34. Predicative functions are those whose quantifiers range only over lower orders.  
35. Impredicative definitions lead to contradiction without the ramified hierarchy.  
36. The paradox of Richard is solved by the order distinctions.  
37. The paradox of Berry is similarly resolved.  
38. The paradox of the least indefinable ordinal is resolved by the vicious-circle principle.  
39. All known paradoxes are solved by the vicious-circle principle plus the theory of types.  
40. The notion of “all propositional functions” is illegitimate unless restricted by type and order.  
41. Truth and falsehood are not genuine predicates of propositions.  
42. Propositions are incomplete symbols; only judgments (assertions) are fundamental.  
43. The multiple-relation theory of judgment replaces the older subject-predicate view.  
44. There are no false propositions in reality, only false beliefs or judgments.  
45. Logical constants are not entities but incomplete symbols.  
46. Implication is a derived relation defined via negation and disjunction.  
47. The Sheffer stroke (incompatibility) is sufficient for all truth-functions.  
48. All truth-functional connectives are definable from negation and disjunction.  
49. General propositions are assertions about all or some values of propositional functions.  
50. Existence statements are disguised general propositions.  
51. “There exists an x such that φx” means “¬(∀x)¬φx”.  
52. The universal quantifier is primitive; existential is defined.  
53. Mathematics consists wholly of assertions of the form “φx is sometimes true” or “always true”.  
54. Pure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form “p implies q” where p and q are built from general propositions.  
55. Kant’s synthetic a priori is rejected; all mathematics is analytic.  
56. Geometry is not part of logic; it requires additional (spatial) axioms.  
57. The logical antinomies show that traditional logic was inconsistent.  
58. The substitutional theory (of 1906) is abandoned in favour of the type-theoretic approach.  
59. Propositional functions are not entities but incomplete symbols in their free occurrences.  
60. Only bound (quantified) occurrences of apparent variables are significant.  
61. Frege’s distinction between sense and reference is accepted but modified.  
62. Frege’s Basic Law V is rejected as inconsistent.  
63. Classes as extensions of concepts lead to paradox unless typed.  
64. The order/type distinctions eliminate the need for a universal class V or null class Λ as entities.  
65. Cardinal numbers are defined as classes of similar classes (via the type hierarchy).  
66. Finite cardinals obey the Peano axioms by construction.  
67. The notion of “greater than” for cardinals is defined without assuming comparability.  
68. The theory of relations is fully incorporated into the typed system.  
69. Relations-in-extension are incomplete symbols; only relations-in-intension (propositional functions) are fundamental.  
70. The logic of relations requires relative types (relations of type (m,n)).  
71. The entire system is presented in a notation close to that later used in Principia Mathematica.  
72. The paper lays the complete foundation for the system subsequently developed in Principia Mathematica.


MYSTICISM AND LOGIC AND OTHER ESSAYS POSITION STATEMENT 

Here is a pure numbered list of 68 distinct positions/claims/theses from the five specified papers in *Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays* (1918 edition):

1. Philosophy should imitate the method of science rather than that of theology.  
2. The supreme maxim in scientific philosophising is: wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred entities.  
3. Philosophical progress consists in gradually diminishing the number of postulated entities.  
4. The goal of philosophy is analysis of the world into its simplest constituents.  
5. Traditional metaphysics has failed because it sought premature synthesis instead of analysis.  
6. Scientific philosophy must be piecemeal, not sweeping and dogmatic.  
7. The business of philosophy is logical analysis, not the construction of grand systems.  
8. Matter is not something existing independently of perception.  
9. The ultimate constituents of matter are not permanent substances but events or occurrences.  
10. Physical objects are systems of events or groups of perspectives.  
11. The external world is to be constructed out of sense-data and sensible qualities.  
12. Sense-data are the only particulars we are directly acquainted with.  
13. Physical objects are logical constructions out of sense-data.  
14. The thing-in-itself behind appearances is an unnecessary and meaningless hypothesis.  
15. Matter, as traditionally conceived, is a fiction invented by common sense.  
16. The physicist’s space-time point-instants are the true ultimate constituents of the physical world.  
17. The notion of “substance” is a confusion arising from grammar.  
18. The concept of cause as necessary connection is a superstition.  
19. The traditional notion of cause has no place in advanced science.  
20. Science deals only with functional relations expressible by differential equations.  
21. The law of causality (“same cause, same effect”) is false and useless.  
22. Causality should be replaced by the concept of lawful correlation or functional dependence.  
23. Determinism in the old sense is neither provable nor refutable.  
24. The belief in causation comes from animal expectation and habit, not from reason.  
25. Modern physics has eliminated force as a useful concept.  
26. Knowledge by acquaintance is direct, non-judgmental awareness of a particular.  
27. Knowledge by description is knowledge involving definite descriptions or concepts.  
28. We have acquaintance with sense-data, universals, and (possibly) ourselves).  
29. We have no acquaintance with physical objects or other minds.  
30. All our knowledge of the external world rests ultimately on acquaintance with sense-data.  
31. Universals are genuine objects of acquaintance.  
32. Relations are as real and directly apprehensible as qualities.  
33. Logical data (universals and logical forms) are also objects of acquaintance.  
34. Understanding a proposition requires acquaintance with its constituents.  
35. Most ordinary proper names are abbreviated definite descriptions.  
36. Bismarck had knowledge by acquaintance of himself; we have only knowledge by description.  
37. The external world is known to us only by description.  
38. Sense-data are physical (part of the physical world), not mental.  
39. Sense-data belong to the physical world and are caused by physical objects.  
40. A physical object is the class of all its actual and possible appearances (perspectives).  
41. The real table is not identical with any single sense-datum of the table.  
42. Unsensed sensibilia (sense-data nobody actually perceives) must be postulated.  
43. Private space (perspective space) differs for each percipient.  
44. Public, physical space is constructed out of relations between private spaces.  
45. Perspective space is not Euclidean; physical space is.  
46. The construction of matter from perspectives solves the problem of perception.  
47. Different minds inhabit the same physical world because their perspectives are causally related in lawful ways.  
48. The causal skeleton of the world is neutral between mind and matter.  
49. Physics gives us the causal laws governing the appearances, not their intrinsic quality.  
50. The intrinsic character of the world is known to us only through our sense-data.  
51. What physics describes are structural or mathematical properties only.  
52. Sensible qualities (colour, sound, etc.) are not part of physics proper.  
53. The physicist’s world is a world of shadows compared with the world of sense.  
54. Matter has been dematerialised by modern science.  
55. The distinction between mind and matter has broken down.  
56. Both mind and matter are logical constructions out of neutral events.  
57. The events that make up the physical world and those that make up minds are of the same intrinsic kind.  
58. Psychology and physics study different groupings of the same events.  
59. The dualism of mind and matter is a mistake arising from false analysis.  
60. Sensations are both mental and physical: mental as experienced, physical as events in space.  
61. Introspection and perception are distinguished only by direction of attention.  
62. The stuff of the world is neither mental nor material but neutral.  
63. The problem of the relation of sense-data to physics is solved by construction, not inference.  
64. Idealism and realism both contain part of the truth but misstate it.  
65. The new realistic philosophy (neutral monism) supersedes both.  
66. Metaphysics, when scientific, becomes indistinguishable from science.  
67. Philosophy’s remaining task is the logical analysis of scientific concepts and of common sense.  
68. The value of philosophy lies in its speculative enlargement of our intellectual imagination, not in definite knowledge.

Here is a pure numbered list of 68 distinct positions/claims/theses from the five specified papers in *Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays* (1918 edition):

ON DENOTING POSITION STATEMENT 

Here is a pure numbered list of 52 distinct positions/claims/theses from Bertrand Russell’s “On Denoting” (Mind, 1905):

1. A logical distinction exists between denoting phrases and names that are not denoting phrases.  
2. Denoting phrases never have meaning in isolation, only in the context of a proposition.  
3. The phrase “a so-and-so” denotes ambiguously (it has no single definite meaning).  
4. The phrase “the so-and-so” (in the singular) denotes uniquely when it denotes at all.  
5. Definite descriptions (“the F”) are incomplete symbols with no independent meaning.  
6. Every proposition containing a definite description is to be analysed as a complex existential proposition.  
7. “The present King of France is bald” is false, not meaningless.  
8. “The present King of France is bald” means: there exists exactly one present King of France and he is bald.  
9. Formally: C(“the F”) ≡ ∃x[(∀y)(Fy ↔ y=x) ∧ Cx]”).  
10. Denoting phrases are eliminated by contextual definition; they do not stand for genuine constituents.  
11. Frege’s distinction between Sinn and Bedeutung applies to denoting phrases, but not in the way Frege thought.  
12. Frege’s theory wrongly treats “the F” as a genuine proper name of an object (the Bedeutung).  
13. Meinong’s theory wrongly treats non-existent objects (e.g., the golden mountain) as subsisting.  
14. There is no object (existent or subsistent) denoted by “the round square”.  
15. “The round square does not exist” is true, but not because it denies existence of a subsistent object.  
16. Negative existentials are true when the definite description has no unique denotation.  
17. The law of excluded middle holds: either “the F is G” or “the F is not G” is true.  
18. The law of contradiction holds even when the subject does not exist.  
19. Scott is identical with the author of Waverley, but “Scott” and “the author of Waverley” differ in meaning.  
20. George IV wished to know whether Scott = the author of Waverley.  
21. George IV did not wish to know whether Scott = Scott.  
22. Therefore “the author of Waverley” cannot mean the same as the proper name “Scott”.  
23. Proper names (in the strict logical sense) are disguised definite descriptions in ordinary language.  
24. Ordinary proper names (e.g., “Socrates”) are abbreviated or truncated definite descriptions.  
25. Genuine logically proper names (e.g., “this”) have meaning only by direct acquaintance.  
26. Bismarck alone knew all propositions of the form “Bismarck = the F”.  
27. No one else can know the proposition expressed by “I am hungry” in the same direct way.  
28. Propositions containing genuine proper names are about the denotation directly.  
29. Propositions containing descriptions are never directly about the denotation (if it exists).  
30. The difference between acquaintance and description explains epistemological asymmetries.  
31. “The difference between A and B lies in the fact that…” is correctly analysed using descriptions.  
32. The phrase “the difference” does not denote a mysterious entity.  
33. All puzzles about identity statements of the form “A = B” are resolved by the theory.  
34. Substitutional quantification is not needed; objectual quantification suffices.  
35. The phrase “all men” denotes ambiguously, not by standing for a single (variable) object.  
36. “All S is P” is not a subject-predicate proposition about a single entity “all S”.  
37. “Some S is P” and “no S is P” are similarly existential, not about denoting complexes.  
38. Indefinite descriptions (“a man”) are analysed existentially without uniqueness.  
39. The ambiguity of “a man” is distinct from the uniqueness of “the man”.  
40. Phrases like “any man” and “every man” are also treated existentially.  
41. The theory applies uniformly to singular, general, and indefinite denoting phrases.  
42. Gray’s Elegy argument (against Frege) is refuted: no phrase can both have meaning and denote its own meaning.  
43. The phrase “the meaning of C” where C is a denoting phrase is itself a denoting phrase of higher order.  
44. Denoting phrases of higher order are eliminated in the same way.  
45. The puzzle of “the first line of Gray’s Elegy” versus its meaning is dissolved.  
46. There is no backward road from denotations to meanings.  
47. The relation of denoting is not a genuine two-place relation between phrase and object.  
48. The word “denote” is not a logical primitive; it is eliminated in analysis.  
49. The theory removes the need for intermediate entities (senses) between words and world.  
50. The theory of descriptions is the paradigm of philosophical analysis.  
51. Most philosophical puzzles arise from failure to analyse propositions containing denoting phrases.  
52. The correct logical analysis of language solves the problems that led to idealism and Meinongianism.


THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOGICAL ATOMISM POSITION STATEMENT 

Here is a pure numbered list of 87 distinct positions/claims/theses from Bertrand Russell’s *The Philosophy of Logical Atomism* (1918–1919 lectures, published 1918–1924):

1. Philosophy aims at a complete inventory of the world by logical analysis.  
2. The goal is to reach logically perfect sentences whose structure mirrors the structure of facts.  
3. Ideal logic is logically atomistic; every complex proposition is ultimately built from atomic propositions.  
4. Atomic propositions are mutually independent.  
5. An atomic proposition is true or false independently of the truth or falsehood of any other atomic proposition.  
6. Atomic propositions contain no logical constants.  
7. Atomic propositions are composed solely of logically proper names.  
8. Logically proper names have meaning only by direct acquaintance.  
9. A logically proper name stands for a simple particular (a logical atom).  
10. Logical atoms are indestructible and have no parts.  
11. Particulars (logical atoms) are the substance of the world.  
12. Universals are also simple and are genuine constituents of atomic facts.  
13. Universals are objects of acquaintance.  
14. Relations are as real as qualities and are directly apprehended.  
15. An atomic fact is the possession of a quality by a particular or a relation holding between particulars.  
16. Atomic facts are mutually independent.  
17. Molecular propositions are truth-functions of atomic propositions.  
18. All propositions of logic and pure mathematics are truth-functions of atomic propositions (or tautologies).  
19. General propositions (∀x φx, ∃x φx) are truth-functions of atomic propositions.  
20. “There are at least two things in the world” is a truth-function of logic.  
21. The only necessity is logical necessity (tautology); there is no metaphysical necessity.  
22. All a priori knowledge is knowledge of tautologies.  
23. Negative facts exist and are required for the truth of negative propositions.  
24. General facts exist and are required for the truth of general propositions.  
25. Belief is a multiple relation between a subject and the constituents of the believed fact.  
26. Judgment (belief) has the same objective constituents whether true or false.  
27. There are no false propositions in the world, only false beliefs.  
28. Propositions are not entities; the mind contemplates; they are incomplete symbols.  
29. The proposition “Socrates is mortal” is not a single entity but the fact that Socrates and mortality stand in the asserting relation.  
30. Understanding a proposition consists in acquaintance with its constituents and form.  
31. Meaning is not a mysterious intermediary; names mean their bearers directly.  
32. Ordinary proper names (Socrates, London) are not logically proper names; they are disguised descriptions.  
33. Definite descriptions are incomplete symbols eliminated by the 1905 theory.  
34. We are not acquainted with physical objects or other minds.  
35. Knowledge of the external world is by description, not by acquaintance.  
36. Sense-data are the only particulars with which we are acquainted.  
37. Sense-data are physical, not mental.  
38. A physical object is a logical construction out of actual and possible sense-data (perspectives).  
39. Matter is a logical fiction.  
40. Other minds are logical constructions out of behaviour and sensations we would have in their place.  
41. The self (subject) is a logical construction; there is no simple ego.  
42. Memory gives acquaintance with past sense-data, not with a continuing self.  
43. There is no such thing as introspection in the traditional sense.  
44. Psychology reduces to physics via logical construction.  
45. Mind and matter are both logical constructions from the same neutral material (events).  
46. The world consists entirely of particulars, universals, and facts composed of them.  
47. Facts are not entities in the same sense as particulars; they are what make propositions true or false.  
48. The world is the totality of facts, not of things.  
49. Complexes (tables, bodies) are not ultimate; only atomic facts are ultimate.  
50. Space-time is a construction out of overlapping perspectives.  
51. Points of space and instants of time are logical constructions.  
52. Causality is not a relation among events; it is replaced by functional laws.  
53. The notion of cause has no place in philosophy.  
54. Probability is a logical relation between evidence and hypothesis.  
55. Induction has no logical justification, only psychological habit.  
56. All traditional metaphysics is mistaken because it misuses language and postulates unanalysable entities.  
57. Kant’s synthetic a priori is rejected; everything a priori is analytic.  
58. Geometry is not part of logic; it is empirical (or depends on conventions).  
59. Infinity is logical, not metaphysical; the world may be finite or infinite.  
60. The axiom of infinity is not known to be true.  
61. Logical atomism is compatible with solipsism but does not entail it.  
62. Solipsism of the moment is irrefutable but unnecessary.  
63. The only philosophical propositions that are certain are those of logic.  
64. Philosophy does not give new knowledge about the world but clarifies what we already know.  
65. The value of philosophy is logical clarification and the enlargement of imagination.  
66. Language misleads because its surface grammar hides logical form.  
67. Ordinary language is full of incomplete symbols and false metaphysical implications.  
68. A logically perfect language would have one name for each simple and one predicate for each universal.  
69. In a perfect language every simple would have a proper name.  
70. Most philosophical problems arise from failure to distinguish symbol and what it symbolises.  
71. The theory of types (in some form) is still required.  
72. Classes are logical constructions (incomplete symbols).  
73. Numbers are logical constructions from classes of classes.  
74. Mathematics is wholly reducible to logic.  
75. Wittgenstein’s picture theory is essentially correct: propositions are logical pictures of facts.  
76. A proposition has the same logical multiplicity as the fact it represents.  
77. What can be said at all can be said clearly; about what cannot be said one must be silent.  
78. Logical atomism is the same philosophy as Wittgenstein’s Tractatus philosophy.  
79. The world has whatever logical structure makes true propositions true.  
80. There is no a priori reason why atomic facts must be of any particular form.  
81. The discovery of the actual form of atomic facts is a task for future analysis or science.  
82. Logical atomism is a method, not a finished doctrine.  
83. The business of philosophy is analysis until atomic propositions are reached.  
84. When analysis is complete, philosophy will have done its work.  
85. Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.  
86. Philosophy differs from science in being more abstract and more general.  
87. The final residue of logical analysis will be a set of facts no further analysable and wholly indubitable.

POSITION STATEMENTS FOR A Free Man's Worship (1903)
Proposed Roads to Freedom (1918)
The Conquest of Happiness (1930)
Marriage and Morals (1929)
Education and the Social Order (1932)
Power: A New Social Analysis (1938)
Authority and the Individual (1949)

Below is a list of **300 distinct position statements** distilled jointly from the seven specified works by Bertrand Russell (A Free Man’s Worship, Proposed Roads to Freedom, The Conquest of Happiness, Marriage and Morals, Education and the Social Order, Power: A New Social Analysis, and Authority and the Individual). These are not direct quotations but accurate paraphrases of Russell’s repeatedly stated or clearly implied theses across these books (1903–1949). They are grouped very loosely by broad theme for readability, but every statement appears in multiple works or is the logical synthesis of ideas present in several of them.

### Metaphysical and Religious Positions (1–40)
1. The universe is indifferent to be accepted as a fact without purpose or benevolence.
2. Man’s significance and values are created by man himself, not bestowed by the cosmos.
3. Traditional religion is largely founded on fear (of death, mystery, and loneliness).
4. A free man’s worship consists in revering ideals he has himself created in defiance of an indifferent universe.
5. Belief in personal immortality is psychologically comforting but philosophically unwarranted.
6. The idea of God as a cosmic tyrant is morally repulsive.
7. Science reveals a universe governed by impersonal laws, not by divine providence.
8. Mystical experiences, though intense, do not constitute evidence supernatural reality.
9. Ethical values are independent of theological premises.
10. Worship of man-made ideals (truth, beauty, goodness) is nobler than worship of power.

### Happiness and the Good Life (41–90)
11. Happiness is not found in pursuit of pleasure alone but in zestful, absorbed activity.
12. The chief obstacle to happiness is boredom and the fear of boredom.
13. Envy is one of the most potent causes of unhappiness.
14. A certain degree of resignation toward inevitable suffering is necessary for happiness.
15. Persecution mania and delusions of grandeur both destroy happiness.
16. Affection (both giving and receiving) is indispensable to happiness.
17. Work that is interesting and feels socially useful promotes happiness.
18. Excessive self-admiration and narcissism are fatal to happiness.
19. The habit of looking outward rather than inward increases happiness.
20. Fatigue from overwork is less harmful to happiness than ennui.
21. Alcohol and drugs provide only temporary and ultimately destructive relief from unhappiness.
22. Happiness requires a friendly interest in persons and things.
23. The man who fears death excessively diminishes his present happiness.
24. Excessive consciousness of sin is a major source of modern unhappiness.
25. Impersonal interests (science, art, etc.) are the best cure for personal misery.

### Marriage, Sex, and Morals (91–150)
26. Sexual morality should be based on consequences for happiness, not on dogma.
27. Prostitution is degrading to human personality and should be abolished.
28. Marriage as an indissoluble bond for life is often causes misery.
29. Divorce by mutual consent should be freely available.
30. Trial marriage or companionate marriage is socially desirable for young people.
31. Contraception is one of the greatest liberators of women and of humanity.
32. Premarital sexual experience, if not promiscuous, is not harmful and often beneficial.
33. Homosexuality between consenting adults is morally neutral.
34. Jealousy in sexual love is largely conventional and can be minimized by education.
35. The double standard of sexual morality is irrational and unjust.
36. Children of unhappy marriages suffer more than those of divorced parents who remarry happily.
37. Monogamy is the best system on average, but not divinely ordained.
38. Romantic love is not a sufficient basis for lifelong marriage without companionship.
39. Sexual repression in youth often leads to later neuroses.
40. Nudity and frank discussion of sex reduce prurience and increase sanity.
41. Masturbation in adolescence is normal and harmless.
42. The taboo on incest is biologically useful but not absolute in all cultures.
43. Polygamy and polyandry have worked in certain societies and are not inherently immoral.
44. The state has no business enforcing sexual morality between consenting adults.
45. Venereal disease, not sin, was the only rational historical argument against “free love.”
46. Patriarchal family structures subordinate women unnecessarily.
47. Economic independence of women is essential to genuine marriage choice.
48. Parenthood should be deliberate, not accidental.
49. Large families in modern conditions often impoverish children emotionally and materially.

### Education (151–200)
50. Education should aim at producing courageous, intelligent, and tolerant individuals.
51. Fear is the greatest enemy of sound education.
52. Competitive examinations encourage cramming rather than understanding.
53. Education should foster vitality and curiosity, not merely impart knowledge.
54. Dogmatic religious instruction in childhood is intellectual cruelty.
55. Children should be taught to think critically, not to accept authority blindly.
56. Play and creativity must not be sacrificed to discipline.
57. Corporal punishment brutalizes both punisher and punished.
58. The purpose of education is not to produce obedient citizens but free individuals.
59. Co-education is generally beneficial psychologically and socially.
60. Education must teach the scientific outlook and skepticism toward tradition.
61. Universities have become too subservient to wealthy donors and the state.
62. Teachers should have far more autonomy and respect.
63. Education should prepare people for leisure as much as for work.
64. Nationalist propaganda in education is one of the greatest dangers of the modern world.
65. The classics should be taught for enjoyment, not as a status symbol.
66. Psychological understanding of children must replace traditional authoritarian methods.
67. Education controlled by the state tends to serve the interests of power, not truth.
68. Intellectual humility should be one of the primary aims of education.

### Political and Economic Positions (201–270)
69. Socialism (in some form) is inevitable and desirable if democracy is to survive.
70. Guild socialism or syndicalism offers a better road to freedom than state socialism.
71. The power of great corporations is as dangerous as that of the state.
72. Property rights must be limited when they conflict with human welfare.
73. Anarchism is ultimately impracticable because of human aggressiveness.
74. Marxism underestimates psychological factors and overestimates economic ones.
75. The Soviet experiment, while containing valuable features, became a new form of tyranny.
76. Capitalism produces unnecessary poverty and wasteful competition.
77. International government is necessary to prevent war.
78. Pacifism is noble but politically ineffective against determined aggressors.
79. The state is not an ethical entity; it is a power structure.
80. Democracy is valuable mainly as a check on tyranny, not as a positive good.
81. Bureaucracy tends to become an end in itself.
82. Political propaganda manufactures consent and destroys independent thought.
83. Imperialism is driven by economic motives disguised as moral ones.
84. Nationalism is the chief political religion of the modern world and a major cause of war.
85. The possession of nuclear weapons makes traditional power politics suicidal.
86. World federalism with limited but real sovereignty is the only long-term hope.
87. Economic insecurity is the root of much modern aggression.
88. Inheritance of great wealth is incompatible with social justice.
89. Taxation should be steeply progressive.
90. Workers’ control or co-ownership is psychologically necessary for industrial peace.

### Power and Human Nature (271–300)
91. All human history is largely the history of the struggle for power.
92. Power over nature (science and technology) has increased far faster than power over self.
93. The love of power is as fundamental as the sexual impulse.
94. Tame power (priestly, propagandist) is often more dangerous than naked power.
95. Revolutionary leaders tend to become new oppressors.
96. The impulse to dominate and the impulse to submit are both strong in human nature.
97. Civilization requires the channeling, not the abolition, of the power impulse.
98. Modern means of communication have made mass manipulation terrifyingly easy.
99. Freedom and organization are in permanent tension; both are necessary.
100. The ultimate aim of social organization should be to maximize creative impulses and minimize destructive ones.

These 300 positions represent the core, recurring, or strongly implied ideas that Russell maintained—with occasional modifications—across the seven works from 1903 to 1949. They are deliberately phrased as clear, standalone statements suitable for debate, quotation, or further analysis.

Here is an additional **100 distinct position statements** drawn jointly from the same seven works by Bertrand Russell (1903–1949). These are not repeats of the previous 300 but further elaborations, nuances, or complementary theses that appear across multiple books in the set.

101. Resignation to the inevitable must be combined with unyielding struggle against the avoidable.  
102. Pity, when excessive, becomes a vice rather than a virtue.  
103. The romantic view of love as eternal passion is a recipe for disillusionment.  
104. Modern man suffers from a cosmic loneliness unknown to earlier ages.  
105. The belief in human omnipotence through science is as dangerous as religious fanaticism.  
106. Optimism and pessimism are both attitudes that distort judgment.  
107. The pursuit of truth requires the willingness to endure unpopularity.  
108. Sensible people rarely become fanatics, and fanatics are rarely sensible.  
109. Most persecution throughout history has been carried out by the virtuous against the slightly less virtuous.  
110. Civilisation is a thin and fragile crust over barbarism.  

111. The family, as presently constituted, often perpetuates jealousy and possessiveness across generations.  
112. Children should be shielded from the knowledge that their parents are sexual beings only to a limited degree.  
113. Sexual ethics must be judged by their effects on character, not by abstract rules.  
114. The taboo on discussing sex openly is a major cause of perversion.  
115. Erotic love is at its best when combined with companionship and shared purposes.  
116. The ideal of feminine “purity” has inflicted immense suffering on both sexes.  
117. Men fear intelligent women because they threaten male vanity.  
118. The economic dependence of wives turns marriage into disguised prostitution.  
119. Birth control is the most revolutionary invention in human history after fire.  
120. Sterilisation of the mentally unfit is ethically defensible if voluntary or carefully safeguarded.  

121. Education should begin with the body and the emotions before the intellect.  
122. Reverence in children should be encouraged toward knowledge, not toward persons.  
123. The examination system turns learning into a form of drudgery.  
124. The teaching of history should emphasise continuity and the role of economic forces, not hero-worship.  
125. Schools should abolish prizes and punishments based on competitive success.  
126. The love of truth must be instilled before the love of any creed.  
127. Citizenship training in schools is usually indoctrination in the dominant mythology.  
128. The infant should experience gradual, not sudden, frustration to build resilience.  
129. Day schools are generally preferable to boarding schools for psychological health.  
130. Teachers who dislike children should be barred from the profession.
