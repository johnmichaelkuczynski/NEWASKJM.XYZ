--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: It is widely held that one can sometimes rationally accept propositions of the form P and not-P.
   EVIDENCE: "On the basis of arguments put forth by Kripke (1977a, 1980), it is widely held that one can sometimes rationally accept propositions of the form P and not-P"

2. VIEW: There are necessary a posteriori truths.
   EVIDENCE: "it is widely held that one can sometimes rationally accept propositions of the form P and not-P and also that there are necessary a posteriori truths"

3. VIEW: Kripke's arguments for these views appear probative only so long as one fails to distinguish between semantics and presemantics.
   EVIDENCE: "We will nd that Kripke's arguments for these views appear probative only so long as one fails to distinguish between semantics and presemantics"

4. VIEW: The distinction between semantics and presemantics is between the literal meanings of sentences and the information on the basis of which one identifies those literal meanings.
   EVIDENCE: "between the literal meanings of sentences, on the one hand, and the information on the basis of which one identi es those literal meanings, on the other"

5. VIEW: The failure to distinguish between semantics and presemantics underlies the popular thesis that intersubstituting co-referring terms sometimes turns true sentences into false ones and vice versa.
   EVIDENCE: "This same failure, it will be argued, underlies the popular thesis that intersubstituting co-referring terms sometimes turns true sentences into false ones and vice versa"

6. VIEW: The thesis that intersubstituting co-referring terms sometimes changes truth values has counterintuitive consequences.
   EVIDENCE: "Though seemingly plausible, this thesis has a number of counterintuitive consequences"

7. VIEW: One counterintuitive consequence of the thesis is that the occurrence of 'snow' in 'it is true that snow is white' doesn't refer to snow.
   EVIDENCE: "among them that the occurrence of ''snow'' in ''it is true that snow is white'' doesn't refer to snow"

8. VIEW: Understanding the distinction between semantics and presemantics suggests a way to develop a semantic system without the counterintuitive consequences.
   EVIDENCE: "An understanding of the distinction between semantics and presemantics suggests a way to develop a semantic system that doesn't have these consequences"

9. VIEW: The semantic system suggested can reconcile our intuitions concerning cognitive content with some powerfully argued theses of contemporary philosophy of language.
   EVIDENCE: "and that, moreover, reconciles our intuitions concerning cognitive content with some powerfully argued theses of contemporary philosophy of language"

10. VIEW: Some of the paper's main contentions are anticipated by Andrzej Boguslawski in his 1994 paper 'Sentential Complementation and Truth.'
   EVIDENCE: "Some of this paper's main contentions are anticipated by Andrzej Boguslawski in his 1994 paper ''Sentential Complementation and Truth.''"

11. VIEW: In at least some contexts, replacing a referring term with a co-referring term preserves truth-value.
   EVIDENCE: "In at least some contexts, replacing a referring term with a co-referring term preserves truth-value"

12. VIEW: The sentence 'Hesperus is closer to the Sun than the Earth' is true.
   EVIDENCE: "(1) ''Hesperus is closer to the Sun than the Earth'' is true"

13. VIEW: 'Phosphorous' and 'Hesperus' refer to the same thing.
   EVIDENCE: "''Phosphorous'' and ''Hesperus'' refer to the same thing"

14. VIEW: The sentence 'Phosphorous is closer to the Sun than the Earth' is also true.
   EVIDENCE: "So (2) ''Phosphorous is closer to the Sun than the Earth.'' is also true"

15. VIEW: If a context tolerates intersubstitutions of co-referring terms, that context is 'extensional.'
   EVIDENCE: "If a context tolerates intersubstitutions of co-referring terms-in other words, if intersubstituting co-referring terms in that context cannot change the truth-value of the host-sentence-that context is ''extensional.''"

16. VIEW: If an expression occurs in an extensional context, it occurs 'extensionally.'
   EVIDENCE: "If an expression occurs in an extensional context, let us say that it occurs ''extensionally.''"

17. VIEW: There seem to be cases where replacing a referring term with a co-referring term leads from truth to falsehood or vice versa.
   EVIDENCE: "There seem to be cases where replacing a referring term with a co-referring term leads from truth to falsehood or vice versa"

18. VIEW: Not all contexts are extensional.
   EVIDENCE: "It thus appears, at least at rst, that not all contexts are extensional"

19. VIEW: If a context is not extensional, it is 'intensional' and the expressions occurring in it do so 'intensionally.'
   EVIDENCE: "If a context is not extensional, we will say that it is ''intensional'' and that the expressions occurring in it do so ''intensionally.''"

20. VIEW: All contexts are extensional.
   EVIDENCE: "Nonetheless, I will argue in this paper thatallcontexts are extensional"

21. VIEW: The truth of 'I am tired' applies to all sentence-types with indexical or context-sensitive components.
   EVIDENCE: "true of ''I am tired'' is true of all sentence-types that contain indexical or otherwise context-sensitive components."

22. VIEW: Most, if not all, sentence-types of natural language contain tense-markers.
   EVIDENCE: "This includes most, if not all, sentence-types of natural language."

23. VIEW: The identity of the proposition meant by a token of a sentence-type with a tense-marker depends on the time of production.
   EVIDENCE: "if a sentence-type contains a tense-marker, the identity of the proposition meant by a given one of its tokens will typically depend on the time at which that token was produced."

24. VIEW: Kaplan and Soames elaborate and defend the view that sentence-types with tense-markers depend on the time of production for their meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "See Kaplan (1989a) and Soames (2002) for an elaboration and defense of this view."

25. VIEW: The function meant by a sentence-type can fail to assign a proposition to a particular token.
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, in some cases, the function meant by a sentence-type will fail to assign a proposition to a particular token of that sentence."

26. VIEW: An utterance about a non-existent pink elephant fails to encode a proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "if there is no pink elephant present, and somebody who is having a hallucination of a pink elephant points to an empty space and says ''that pink elephant is a threat to our way of life'', that utterance fails to encode a proposition"

27. VIEW: Strawson, Kaplan, Salmon, Soames, and others, including the author, believe that sentence-tokens typically have propositions for their literal meanings.
   EVIDENCE: "In any case, this is what Strawson (1950), Kaplan (1989a), Salmon (1986), Soames (2002) and others would say (and it is my own position)."

28. VIEW: Some philosophers deny that sentence-tokens typically have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings.
   EVIDENCE: "But a number of philosophers deny this very contention, holding that, with at most a few exceptions, sentence-tokens typically don't have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings."

29. VIEW: Even after setting aside cases of presupposition-failure, sentence-tokens do not have truth-evaluable entities for their meanings according to some philosophers.
   EVIDENCE: "So even after we set aside cases of presupposition-failure, such as the one earlier described, sentence-tokens don't have truth-evaluable entities for their meanings."

30. VIEW: Contextualists believe that sentence-tokens typically communicate propositions but require contextual facts to fill in semantic gaps.
   EVIDENCE: "Such authors don't deny that sentence-tokens (or, more accurately, the speech-acts of which those tokens are constituents) do typically communicate propositions; but they hold that, as a rule, facts about the context are needed to ll in gaps in what is semantically encoded in the sentence-tokens themselves."

31. VIEW: Recanati and Travis are proponents of contextualism or radical pragmatics.
   EVIDENCE: "Among such authors are Recanati (1989, 1993, 2004) and Travis (1975), and their viewpoint is sometimes known as ''contextualism'' or ''radical pragmatics.''"

32. VIEW: The meaning of 'Charles is ready' depends on knowing what Charles is ready for.
   EVIDENCE: "Suppose I say ''Charles is ready.'' Unless we know what Charles is ready for, we don't know what has been said."

33. VIEW: The literal meaning of 'that is red' leaves open what has been affirmed about the object's redness.
   EVIDENCE: "Similarly, if I say, indicating some de nite object, ''that is red'', the literal meaning of my sentence-token leaves it open precisely what has been af rmed."

34. VIEW: The standard of redness intended can vary based on the context, affecting the truth of the statement 'that is red'.
   EVIDENCE: "If I am in the house of somebody who abhors red objects and has thus made sure that nothing very red (e.g. a re-engine red balloon) is in her house, then my utterance of ''that is red'' may be true if the object in question is just slightly pinkish, whereas if I am in the house of somebody who loves red objects and has decorated her house with scarlet drapes, burgundy carpets, and so on, then my describing that same object as ''red'' will be false."

35. VIEW: Contextualism holds that these points about the need for context apply to all sentence-tokens, with few exceptions.
   EVIDENCE: "According to contextualism, these points (mutatis mutandis) hold of all sentence-tokens (with a few possible exceptions, e.g. tokens of ''1 + 1=2'')."

36. VIEW: Cappelen and Lepore provide a thorough discussion of contextualism.
   EVIDENCE: "For a thorough and powerful discussion of contextualism see Cappelen and Lepore (2005)."

37. VIEW: Pinker provides a brief but effective discussion of contextualism.
   EVIDENCE: "For a brief but effective discussion of it, see Pinker (2007:107-124)."

38. VIEW: Russell's Theory of Descriptions states that a sentence with the form 'the phi' has a meaning that is a quantified generalization.
   EVIDENCE: "The essence of that theory is given by the contention that: (TD) In virtue of having the form ''. . .the phi. . .'',2a sentence has for its meaning the proposition something x uniquely has phi and. . .x. . .or, if not that exact proposition, then some other, logically equivalent, quanti ed generalization."

39. VIEW: According to Russell's Theory of Descriptions, 'the king of France is bald' means a quantified generalization about the king of France being bald.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, according to Theory of Descriptions, ''the king of France is bald'' has for its meaning a quanti ed generalization that is either identical or equivalent with:something x is uniquely a king of France; moreover,x is bald."

40. VIEW: If Russell's Theory of Descriptions is correct, 'the king of France' is not a referring term but a quantifier.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, if that theory is correct, then ''the king of France'' is not a referring term and is instead a quanti er (or, in any case, a quanti er-like expression)."

41. VIEW: The conception of meaning advocated by Quine, Davidson, Dummett, Chomsky, Kaplan, and Soames is not confined to one tradition.
   EVIDENCE: "(It should be pointed out these authors are otherwise often in sharp disagreement with one another concerning foundational semantic matters and that this conception of meaning is therefore not con ned to some one tradition.)"

42. VIEW: Cappelen and Lepore have made a strong case against contextualism.
   EVIDENCE: "Also, as previously indicated, Cappelen and Lepore (2005) have made an extremely strong case against contextualism"

43. VIEW: Pinker has also made a strong case against contextualism.
   EVIDENCE: "as has Pinker (2007:107-124)"

44. VIEW: One can hold that sentence-tokens as a rule do have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings without being guilty of sheer dogmatism.
   EVIDENCE: "and therefore one can, without being guilty of sheer dogmatism, hold that sentence-tokens as a rule do have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings."

45. VIEW: Searle does not deny that many sentence-tokens typically have complete propositions for their literal meanings.
   EVIDENCE: "Searle (1970:117-136) doesn't deny that many sentence-tokens typically have complete propositions for their literal meanings"

46. VIEW: Searle denies the view that for every sentence the literal meaning can be construed as the meaning it has independently of any context.
   EVIDENCE: "but he does deny ''the view that for every sentence the literal meaning of the sentence can be construed as the meaning it has independently of any context whatever'' (Searle, 1970:117)"

47. VIEW: Searle holds that the notion of literal meaning only has application relative to a set of contextual or background assumptions.
   EVIDENCE: "holding that ''in general, the notion of literal meaning only has application relative to a set of contextual or background assumptions'' (Searle, 1970:117)."

48. VIEW: Some tokens of 'the cat is on the mat' do have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings, while others do not.
   EVIDENCE: "So, in Searle's view, even after cases of presupposition- and reference-failure are set aside, some tokens of ''the cat is on the mat'' do, whereas others do not, have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings."

49. VIEW: An utterance of 'the cat is on the mat' made in somebody's living room will probably have a determinately true or false proposition for its meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "An utterance, made in somebody's living room, in the presence of a certain cat and a certain mat, will probably have for its meaning a (determinately) true or false proposition"

50. VIEW: The same utterance of 'the cat is on the mat' made in outer space may not have a determinately true or false proposition for its meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "whereas (to use one of Searle's own examples) the same could well fail to hold of such an utterance made in outer space, in a rapidly rotating spaceship, in connection with a cat outside the spaceship that is barely contiguous with the edge of some mat."

51. VIEW: Searle's point is that sentence-tokens have truth-evaluable literal meanings only relative to certain background assumptions.
   EVIDENCE: "Searle's point is not that sentence-tokens don't ever have truth-evaluable literal meanings, but rather they have such meanings only relative to certain background assumptions"

52. VIEW: Searle is not denying that sentences have literal meanings, but that literal meaning is relative to background assumptions.
   EVIDENCE: "Similarly, when I say that the literal meaning of a sentence only has application relative to the coordinate system of our background assumptions, I am not denying that sentences have literal meanings. Literal meaning, though relative, is still literal meaning (Searle, 1970:132)."

53. VIEW: The argument in the paper is consistent with Searle's thesis.
   EVIDENCE: "The argument put forth in this paper is consistent with Searle's thesis"

54. VIEW: The question of whether or to what extent Searle's thesis is correct lies outside the scope of the present paper.
   EVIDENCE: "The question of whether or to what extent Searle's thesis is correct lies outside the scope of the present paper."

55. VIEW: The viewpoints of bona fide contextualists and authors with contextualist leanings have roots in the work of Wittgenstein and Austin.
   EVIDENCE: "Cappelen and Lepore point out that the viewpoints of bona de contextualists (e.g. Travis, 1975) and authors with contextualist leanings (e.g. Searle, 1970) have roots in the work of Wittgenstein (1958) (which was completed and disseminated, though not published, in 1949) and Austin (1953)."

56. VIEW: Proper names are mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "Supposing, if only for the sake of argument, that proper names are mere labels"

57. VIEW: There is no difficulty accounting for the dramatic communicative differences between sentences like 'Hesperus is identical with Phosphorous' and 'Hesperus is identical with Hesperus' if proper names are mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "there is no dif culty at all accounting for the dramatic communicative differences between, for example, ''Hesperus is identical with Phosphorous'' and ''Hesperus is identical with Hesperus.''"

58. VIEW: The differences in communication between sentences with different proper names are not due to differences in literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "But those differences are to be explained not by supposing that those sentences differ in respect of literal meaning."

59. VIEW: The differences in communication between sentences with different proper names are explained by how people ascertain the literal meanings of sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "Rather, those differences are to be explained in terms of facts about how people ascertain the literal meanings of the sentences that they encounter."

60. VIEW: For any predicate phi, there is no difficulty accounting for the fact that what is communicated by 'Hesperus has phi' may differ dramatically from what is communicated by 'Phosphorous has phi' if proper names are mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "First, for any predicate phi, supposing that ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorous'' are mere labels, there is no dif culty accounting for the fact that what is communicated by ''Hesperus has phi'' may differ dramatically from what is communicated by ''Phosphorous has phi.''"

61. VIEW: What was said about 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorous' is true for any two co-referring proper names.
   EVIDENCE: "Second, what was just said about ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorous'' is true mutatis mutandis of any two co-referring proper names."

62. VIEW: Many apparent threats to extensionality prove to be illusory given the truth of the contentions about proper names being mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "We will also see why, given the truth of these contentions, many (but not all) apparent threats to extensionality prove to be illusory."

63. VIEW: The remaining threats to extensionality will be dealt with in subsequent sections.
   EVIDENCE: "(The remaining threats will be dealt with in subsequent sections.)"

64. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by 'Smith is a great racquetball player' is 'O is a great racquetball player' if proper names are mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "Given our supposition that proper names are mere labels, it follows that, for some object O, the proposition literally meant by (7) is: (8) O is a great racquetball player."

65. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by 'Bob is a great racquetball player' is the same as the proposition meant by 'Smith is a great racquetball player' if 'Bob' and 'Smith' are mere labels for the same thing.
   EVIDENCE: "Given that ''Bob'' is a mere label, and that it labels the same thing as ''Smith'', the proposition literally meant by (9) is (8)."

66. VIEW: Sentences 'Smith is a great racquetball player' and 'Bob is a great racquetball player' tell different things under the circumstances described.
   EVIDENCE: "At the same time, under the circumstances, (7) and (9) tell me different things."

67. VIEW: What is learned from 'Smith is a great racquetball player' does not entail, and is not entailed by, what is learned from 'Bob is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "Indeed, what I learn in consequence of being told (7) does not entail, and isn't entailed by, what I learn in consequence of being told (9)."

68. VIEW: It is not possible for 'Smith is a great racquetball player' and 'Bob is a great racquetball player' to tell different things if they have the same literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "''But,'' it will be said, ''this isn't possible. (7) and (9) have the same literal meaning. Therefore what I learn from the one must coincide with what I learn from the other."

69. VIEW: The supposed paradox that 'Smith is a great racquetball player' and 'Bob is a great racquetball player' do and do not coincide in what they tell about the world is based on a fallacy.
   EVIDENCE: "The fallacy that underlies this supposed paradox is easily exposed."

70. VIEW: What a sentence communicates to somebody isn't always confined to its literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "What an occurrence of a sentence communicates to somebody isn't always con ned to its literal meaning"

71. VIEW: There is a certain person x who uniquely has specific properties and is named 'Smith'.
   EVIDENCE: "There is a certain person x such that x uniquely has such and such properties (viz. yesterday, from a considerable distance, I saw x leaping about in a decidedly athletic manner, and x was wearing a bright-red shirt. . .), and such that ''Smith'' is x's name;"

72. VIEW: Smith is a great racquetball player.
   EVIDENCE: "moreover, x is a great racquetball player."

73. VIEW: The content of the knowledge needed to assign the right meaning to (7) is given by (11).
   EVIDENCE: "the content of the knowledge that I must exploit to assign the right meaning to (7) is given by (11)."

74. VIEW: Sentence (7) communicates (11) to the speaker, despite having (8) as its literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "It is thus no wonder that (7) communicates (11) to me, even though it has (8) for its literal meaning."

75. VIEW: What was said about (7) applies to any sentence of the form 'Smith has phi'.
   EVIDENCE: "What we just said about (7) is true mutatis mutandis of any sentence of the form''Smith has phi.''"

76. VIEW: On the day in question, hearing 'Smith is also a ne chess-player' communicates a proposition similar to (12).
   EVIDENCE: "So if, on the day in question, I hear a token of ''Smith is also a ne chess-player'', what is communicated to me is some proposition at least approximately like: (12)"

77. VIEW: The existence-claim used to access the meaning of (7) changes over time.
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, as time passes, the existence-claim through which I access the meaning of (7) necessarily changes."

78. VIEW: Two days after first seeing Smith, the existence-claim for the utterance 'Smith has decided to become a professional chess-player' is not (13) but (14).
   EVIDENCE: "Given obvious extensions of the points already made, the existence-claim through which I assign the right literal meaning to that utterance is not: (13)"
   EVIDENCE: "Rather, it is: (14)"

79. VIEW: There are other reasons why the information used to access the literal meaning of (7) must change over time.
   EVIDENCE: "As we will discuss later, there are other reasons why, with the passage of time, there must be changes in the identity of the information through which I must access the literal meaning of (7)."

80. VIEW: What was said about (7) applies to (9).
   EVIDENCE: "What we just said about (7) is true mutatis mutandisof (9)."

81. VIEW: Hearing the noise 'Bob' and knowing what it refers to are different.
   EVIDENCE: "Hearing the noise ''Bob'' is one thing. Knowing what it refers to is another."

82. VIEW: To fix 'Bob' to the right person, background knowledge must be exploited.
   EVIDENCE: "To af x ''Bob'' to the right person, I must exploit background knowledge."

83. VIEW: The relevant background knowledge for 'Bob' is given by a proposition similar to (15).
   EVIDENCE: "Given the circumstances under which I am rst told to whom ''Bob'' refers (see p. 4), the relevant background knowledge is given by a proposition at least approximately like the following: (15)"

84. VIEW: At the level of semantics, 'Bob' merely labels an individual x without describing it.
   EVIDENCE: "even though there is some individual x such that, at the level of semantics, ''Bob'' merely labels x, and thus doesn't describe it,"

85. VIEW: The information through which the speaker learns that 'Bob' labels x does describe x.
   EVIDENCE: "the information through which I learn that ''Bob'' labels x does describe it."

86. VIEW: Just after shaking hands with Bob, hearing 'Bob is a great racquetball player' communicates a proposition similar to (16).
   EVIDENCE: "Once again, suppose that, just after shaking hands with Bob, I am told: (9) ''Bob is a great racquetball player.'' In that case, for reasons analogous to those given in connection with (7), what is communicated to me will be some proposition along the lines of: (16)"

87. VIEW: Any sentence of the form 'Bob has phi' would communicate a proposition similar to (17) under the described circumstances.
   EVIDENCE: "By obvious extensions of this reasoning, what would be communicated to me, under the circumstances just described, by any sentence of the form ''Bob has phi'' would be: (17)"

88. VIEW: Sentences (7) and (9) have entirely different cognitive values under the described circumstances.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus it is no mystery why, under these circumstances, (7) and (9) should have entirely different cognitive values."

89. VIEW: Sentence (7) communicates (11), while sentence (9) communicates (16).
   EVIDENCE: "(7)communicates(11), whereas (9)communicates(16)."

90. VIEW: Propositions (11) and (16) are completely different and do not entail each other.
   EVIDENCE: "(11) and (16) are completely different propositions. Indeed, neither so much as entails the other."

91. VIEW: The expression 'that snow is white' is neither true nor false.
   EVIDENCE: "But, unlike 'snow is white', 'that snow is white' is neither true nor false."

92. VIEW: The expression 'that snow is white' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in 'snow is white'.
   EVIDENCE: "The latter expression merely refers to a certain proposition, without taking a stand, so to speak, as to its truth or falsity. Just as 'that snow is white' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in 'snow is white'"

93. VIEW: The expression 'that Smith is a great racquetball player' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in 'Smith is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "so (18) 'that Smith is a great racquetball player' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in: (7) 'Smith is a great racquetball player.'"

94. VIEW: The expression 'that Bob is a great racquetball player' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in 'Bob is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "And the expression (19) 'that Bob is a great racquetball player' refers to the proposition semantically encoded in (9) 'Bob is a great racquetball player'"

95. VIEW: Proper names are mere labels.
   EVIDENCE: "Supposing, as we have been, that proper names are mere labels"

96. VIEW: The proposition referred to by both 'that Smith is a great racquetball player' and 'that Bob is a great racquetball player' is 'That O is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "there is some object O such that the proposition referred to by both (18) and (19) is: (20) That O is a great racquetball player."

97. VIEW: The sentence 'Fred believes that Bob is a great racquetball player' attributes the property of being believed by Fred to the proposition 'That O is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "(21) attributes a certain property to a certain proposition. The property is: being believed by Fred and the proposition is (20)."

98. VIEW: The sentence 'Fred believes that Smith is a great racquetball player' attributes the property of being believed by Fred to the proposition 'That O is a great racquetball player'.
   EVIDENCE: "(22) attributes a certain property to a certain proposition. As before, the property is: being believed by Fred and the proposition is (20)."

99. VIEW: The sentences 'Fred believes that Bob is a great racquetball player' and 'Fred believes that Smith is a great racquetball player' semantically encode the same proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, (21) and (22) semantically encode the very same proposition."

100. VIEW: The sentences 'Fred believes that Bob is a great racquetball player' and 'Fred believes that Smith is a great racquetball player' may differ in truth-value in terms of what they communicate.
   EVIDENCE: "But it is obvious that, under the circumstances earlier described, what (21) communicates may differ in truth-value from what (22) communicates."

101. VIEW: Semantically, 'Bob' is a name.
   EVIDENCE: "We know that semantically 'Bob' is a name."

102. VIEW: Under certain circumstances, sentences containing 'Bob' communicate propositions of the form 'there is a person x such that x uniquely has thus and such characteristics and 'Bob' is x's name'.
   EVIDENCE: "under the circumstances in question, sentences of the form '. . .Bob. . .' communicate propositions of the form: there is a person x such that x uniquely has thus and such characteristics(viz. x is a pudgy and unathletic looking person with whom I shook hands a moment ago...)and 'Bob' is x's name; moreover,...x..."

103. VIEW: Under certain circumstances, 'Bob' acts as a certain kind of existential quantifier.
   EVIDENCE: "Under those circumstances, then, 'Bob' is acting as a certain kind of existential quanti er."

104. VIEW: The quantifier 'Bob' can be given either wide-scope or narrow-scope with respect to 'Fred believes'.
   EVIDENCE: "That quanti er can be given either 'wide-scope' or 'narrow-scope' with respect to 'Fred believes.'"

105. VIEW: The sentence 'Fred believes that Bob is a great racquetball player' is ambiguous between two propositions regarding the scope of the quantifier 'Bob'.
   EVIDENCE: "So, speaking in terms of what (21) communicates (as opposed to what it literally mans), (21) is ambiguous between: (23) Fred believes that: there is a person x such that x uniquely has thus and such characteristics (viz. x is a pudgy and unathletic looking person with whom I shook hands a moment ago. . .) and 'Bob' is x's name and, moreover, x is a great racquetball player. and (24) There is a person x such that x uniquely has thus and such characteristics (viz. x is a pudgy and unathletic looking person with whom I shook hands a moment ago. . .) and 'Bob' is x's name and, moreover, Fred believes that: x is a great racquetball player."

106. VIEW: The expression 'for some king of France x, x is a king of France and such that, for any king of France y, y=x' is a quantifier.
   EVIDENCE: "Each of the underlined expressions is, uncontroversially, a quanti er."

107. VIEW: The expression 'for any object king of France z, z is bald' is a quantifier.
   EVIDENCE: "Each of the underlined expressions is, uncontroversially, a quanti er."

108. VIEW: Definite descriptions are quantifiers or quantifier-like, according to Russell's theory.
   EVIDENCE: "In this context, then, I will (when operating on the assumption that Russell's theory is correct), describe de nite descriptions as ''quanti ers.''"
   EVIDENCE: "It is to be understood that, in so doing, I am speaking elliptically, i.e. that I am saying of them that they are either quanti ers or quanti er-like (in a way that singular terms are not)."

109. VIEW: If Russell's theory is correct, there is much to be said for the view that definite descriptions are quantifiers.
   EVIDENCE: "That said, there is much to be said for the view that, if Russell's theory is right, de nite descriptions arequanti ers."

110. VIEW: The concept of indirect-reference will be discussed in Part III.
   EVIDENCE: "We will see why this is so when, in Part III, we discuss the concept of indirect-reference."

111. VIEW: If definite descriptions are not referring terms, the difference in truth-value between examples (5) and (6) is irrelevant to the question of extensionality.
   EVIDENCE: "If de nite descriptions are not referring terms, then the apparent difference in truth-value between, for example, (5) and (6) is irrelevant to the question whether extensionality is true."

112. VIEW: It cannot be taken for granted that definite descriptions are not referring terms.
   EVIDENCE: "But, of course, it cannot be taken for granted that de nite descriptions are not referring terms."

113. VIEW: To establish extensionality, one must establish either that definite descriptions are not referring terms or that intersubstituting co-referring definite descriptions does not change truth-value.
   EVIDENCE: "So, in order to establish extensionality, one of two contentions would have to be established, namely: (A) De nite descriptions are not referring terms. (B) Even if de nite descriptions are in fact referring terms, intersubstituting co-referring de nite descriptions does not, contrary to initial appearances, change truth-value."

114. VIEW: If contention (B) is correct, then the question of whether contention (A) is correct becomes irrelevant to the question of whether extensionality is correct.
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, if (B) is correct, then the question whether (A) is correct becomes irrelevant to the question whether extensionality is correct."

115. VIEW: The author will argue for contention (B).
   EVIDENCE: "We will thus argue for (B)."

116. VIEW: Even if (5) and (6) have the same literal meaning, there is no difficulty accounting for the fact that they may communicate propositions with different truth-values.
   EVIDENCE: "And we will see that, even if (5) and (6) have the very same literal meaning, there is no dif culty accounting for the fact that they may obviously communicate propositions that have (or might have) different truth-values."

117. VIEW: There are two kinds of referring terms: those that refer directly and those that refer indirectly.
   EVIDENCE: "It is widely held that there are two kinds of referring terms-those that refer ''directly'' and those that refer ''indirectly.''"

118. VIEW: According to Kaplan, when addressing Fred with 'you are tall', the literal meaning is the singular proposition that Fred is tall.
   EVIDENCE: "Suppose that, addressing Fred, I say ''you are tall.'' According to Kaplan (1989a), there is some object x such that x is identical with Fred and such that what is literally meant by my utterance is the singular proposition: x is tall."

119. VIEW: Kaplan's position generalized states that a token of an indexical expression that refers to an object O has a literal meaning that includes O itself as a constituent.
   EVIDENCE: "Appropriately generalized, Kaplan's position amounts to this. Let D be a token of an indexical expression that refers to O. (An indexical is an expression whose referent is a function of the circumstances in which it is uttered. Examples of indexicals are ''I'', ''you'', ''that car'', and ''this bird.'') In that case, in virtue of having the form ''. . .D. . .'', a sentence-token S has for its literal meaning a proposition that has as a constituent O itself-not some Fregean sense, not some concept under which O falls, and not some description that O satis es."

120. VIEW: When using 'you' in a sentence, the proposition encoded includes the person being addressed as a constituent, not a concept under which they fall.
   EVIDENCE: "So if, while speaking to you, I produce a sentence-token of the form ''. . .you. . .'', then in virtue of that fact my utterance encodes a proposition that has you-not a concept that you satisfy, but youper se-as a constituent."

121. VIEW: The concept 'person to whom I am speaking' does not enter into the proposition meant by the utterance of 'you'.
   EVIDENCE: "More exactly, there is some x such that x is identical with you and such that, if I say ''you are tall'', the proposition literally meant by my words is simply: x is tall. The concept person to whom I am speaking does not make it into that proposition; nor does any other concept under which you happen to fall."

122. VIEW: The utterance of 'you' is directly referential.
   EVIDENCE: "My utterance of ''you'' is thus ''directly referential.''"

123. VIEW: The concept 'person to whom I am speaking' plays an important semantic role but does not itself enter into the proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, the concept person to whom I am speaking plays an important semantic role in this context. But, if Kaplan is right, that role is only to pick out the entity that makes it into the relevant proposition-that concept does not itself do so."

124. VIEW: When pointing to a car and saying 'that must have cost a fortune', the literal meaning is that the car must have cost a fortune.
   EVIDENCE: "To take another example, suppose that I point to some car x and say ''that must have cost a fortune.'' In that case, supposing that Kaplan's position is correct, the literal meaning of my utterance is: x must have cost a fortune."

125. VIEW: The concept 'ostended object' is not part of the literal meaning of the utterance about the car.
   EVIDENCE: "The concept ostended object is no part of the literal meaning of my utterance."

126. VIEW: If definite descriptions are directly referential, intersubstituting them never changes the truth-value of what is literally meant by sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "see that, if de nite descriptions are directly referential, then intersubstituting them never changes the truth-value of what is literally meant by sentences."

127. VIEW: The term 'direct referentialism' refers to the position that definite descriptions are devices of direct reference.
   EVIDENCE: "Let us use the term ''direct referentialism'' to refer to the position that de nite descriptions are devices of direct reference."

128. VIEW: The term 'Russellianism' refers to the position that definite descriptions are not referring terms and are instead quantifiers or quantifier-like expressions as described by Russell.
   EVIDENCE: "And let us use the term ''Russellianism'' to refer to the position that de nite descriptions are not referring terms and are instead quanti ers (or quanti er-like expressions) of the kind that Russell described."

129. VIEW: Direct referentialists agree almost entirely with Russellians.
   EVIDENCE: "Direct referentialists agree almost entirely with Russell."

130. VIEW: Both Russellians and direct referentialists agree that 'the phi' is true if and only if something x uniquely has phi and x satisfies the rest of the sentence.
   EVIDENCE: "In general, Russellians and direct referentialists both agree that ''. . .the phi. . .'' is true iff: something x uniquely has phi and. . .x. . ."

131. VIEW: Russellians and direct referentialists disagree about the semantics of 'the phi'.
   EVIDENCE: "But Russellians and direct referentialists obviouslydodisagree about the semantics of ''. . .the phi. . .''"

132. VIEW: For Russellians, 'the phi' means there is exactly one object O that has phi and O satisfies the rest of the sentence.
   EVIDENCE: "For Russellians, the rule that assigns meaning to ''. . .the phi. . .'' is this: (29)''. . .the phi. . .'' means (30) there is exactly one object O that has phi; moreover,. . .O. . ."

133. VIEW: For direct referentialists, if there is exactly one object O that has phi, then 'the phi' means O satisfies the rest of the sentence.
   EVIDENCE: "For direct referentialists, the rule that assigns meaning to ''. . .the phi. . .'' is this: If there is exactly one object O that has phi, then (29) ''. . .the phi. . .'' means (31)...O..."

134. VIEW: If nothing uniquely has phi, then for direct referentialists, 'the phi' does not bear any proposition and is neither true nor false.
   EVIDENCE: "If nothing uniquely has phi, then (29) doesn't bear any proposition at all and, therefore, is neither true nor false."

135. VIEW: According to the direct referentialist, 'the inventor of bifocals snored' does not encode any proposition if nobody uniquely invented bifocals.
   EVIDENCE: "So according to the direct referentialist, (32) ''the inventor of bifocals snored'' doesn't encode any proposition if nobody uniquely invented bifocals."

136. VIEW: If exactly one person O invented bifocals, then for the direct referentialist, 'the inventor of bifocals snored' means O snored.
   EVIDENCE: "But if exactly one person O invented bifocals, then (32) means: (33) O snored."

137. VIEW: Given that Benjamin Franklin uniquely invented bifocals, the direct referentialist says that 'the inventor of bifocals snored' encodes the proposition that Benjamin Franklin snored.
   EVIDENCE: "So given that, in actuality, Benjamin Franklin uniquely invented bifocals, the direct referentialist says that (32) encodes the proposition: (34) Benjamin Franklin snored."

138. VIEW: According to the Russellian, the proposition encoded in 'the inventor of bifocals snored' is equivalent to 'exactly one object x invented bifocals; moreover, x snored'.
   EVIDENCE: "But according to the Russellian, the proposition encoded in (32) is identical (or at least equivalent) with: (35) exactly one object x invented bifocals; moreover, x snored."

139. VIEW: The direct-referentialist's position and the Russellian's position differ significantly because the propositions they encode do not entail each other.
   EVIDENCE: "Given that (34) doesn't entail (35), and that (35) doesn't entail (34), there thus turns out to be a signi cant difference between the direct-referentialist's position and the Russellian's."

140. VIEW: A consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that 'Fred believes that the inventor of bifocals snored' encodes the proposition 'Fred believes that O snored' for some object O identical with Benjamin Franklin.
   EVIDENCE: "A consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that, for some object O (such that, as it happens, O is identical with Benjamin Franklin), (36) ''Fred believes that the inventor of bifocals snored'' encodes the proposition: (37) Fred believes that O snored."

141. VIEW: For the direct referentialist, 'Fred believes that the first postmaster general snored' also has the meaning 'Fred believes that O snored'.
   EVIDENCE: "It follows that, for the direct referentialist, (38) ''Fred believes that the rst postmaster general snored'' also has (37) for its meaning."

142. VIEW: Another consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that 'Little Timmy believes that the whole number that comes immediately after one is less than three' has the literal meaning 'Little Timmy believes that O is one less than three' for some O identical with the number two.
   EVIDENCE: "Another consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that, for some O (such that O is identical with the number two), (5) ''Little Timmy believes that the whole number that comes immediately after one is less than three'' has for its literal meaning the proposition: (39) Little Timmy believes that O is one less than three."

143. VIEW: For the direct referentialist, 'Little Timmy believes that the number n such that n is a unique even prime if arithmetic is incomplete and is otherwise a unique positive square root of 71 is less than three' also has the meaning 'Little Timmy believes that O is one less than three'.
   EVIDENCE: "And it follows that, for the direct referentialist, (6) ''Little Timmy believes that the number n such that n is a unique even prime if arithmetic is incomplete and is otherwise a unique positive square root of 71 is less than three. also has (39) for its meaning."

144. VIEW: If direct referentialism is correct, then sentences (5) and (6) coincide in respect of literal meaning and truth-value, as do sentences (36) and (38).
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, if direct referentialism is correct, then (5) and (6) coincide in respect of literal meaning and, therefore, in respect of truth-value, the same being true of (36) and (38)."

145. VIEW: There is a glaring difference in cognitive value between sentences (36) and (38) and also between sentences (5) and (6).
   EVIDENCE: "But, of course, there is a glaring difference in cognitive value between (36) and (38) and also between (5) and (6)."

146. VIEW: An immediate consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that anyone who understands (32) knows that it isn't either true or false.
   EVIDENCE: "an immediate consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that anyone who understands (32) knows that it isn't either true or false"

147. VIEW: An immediate consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that (32) isn't true unless exactly one object x invented bifocals and x snored.
   EVIDENCE: "it isn't true, unless exactly one object x invented bifocals and, moreover, x snored"

148. VIEW: The italicized proposition is identical with (35).
   EVIDENCE: "Notice that the italicized proposition is identical with (35)."

149. VIEW: An immediate consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that an utterance of (32) will communicate (35).
   EVIDENCE: "an immediate consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that an utterance of (32) will communicate (35)."

150. VIEW: If the direct referentialist were right, then the semantic rule for (32) would be (NR).
   EVIDENCE: "if the direct referentialist were right, then the semantic rule for (32) would be: (NR) ''The inventor of bifocals snored'' means (or is true iff): Benjamin Franklin snored."

151. VIEW: (NR) is not the right semantic rule.
   EVIDENCE: "But (NR) obviously isn't the right semantic rule."

152. VIEW: What 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to is a function of who invented bifocals.
   EVIDENCE: "What ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to is a function of who invented bifocals."

153. VIEW: If Smith invented bifocals, then 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to Smith.
   EVIDENCE: "If Smith did so, then ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to Smith."

154. VIEW: If Jones invented bifocals, then 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to Jones.
   EVIDENCE: "If Jones did so, then it refers to Jones."

155. VIEW: If definite descriptions are devices of reference, then the semantic rule for 'the inventor of bifocals' is that if somebody O uniquely invented bifocals, then 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to O.
   EVIDENCE: "if somebody O uniquely invented bifocals, then ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to O."

156. VIEW: If definite descriptions are devices of direct reference, then the semantic rule for 'the inventor of bifocals' is that if somebody O uniquely invented bifocals, then 'the inventor of bifocals' refers directly to O.
   EVIDENCE: "if somebody O uniquely invented bifocals, then ''the inventor of bifocals'' refersdirectlyrefers to O."

157. VIEW: If definite descriptions are devices of direct reference, then the semantic rule for 'the inventor of bifocals snored' will be (RF).
   EVIDENCE: "if de nite descriptions are devices of directreference, then the semantic rule for ''the inventor of bifocals snored'' will be (RF)."

158. VIEW: If the direct referentialist is right, a token of (32) will communicate (35).
   EVIDENCE: "if the direct referentialist is right, a token of (32) will communicate (35)."

159. VIEW: When people understand sentences, they do so on the basis of a knowledge of the relevant semantic rules.
   EVIDENCE: "This assumes that, when people understand sentences, they do so on the basis of a knowledge (of some kind or other) of the relevant semantic rules."

160. VIEW: It is not an unreasonable assumption that people understand sentences based on knowledge of semantic rules.
   EVIDENCE: "But this is not an unreasonable assumption."

161. VIEW: People know what the sentence 'if there's an albatross in Greenland, then either coal is purple or owls speak Portuguese' means even if they have never heard it before.
   EVIDENCE: "Consider the sentence: ''if there's an albatross in Greenland, then either coal is purple or owls speak Portuguese.'' You know what that sentence means, even though (we may suppose) you have never heard it before."

162. VIEW: The most plausible way to explain understanding of the sentence about albatrosses, coal, and owls is that people know the relevant semantic rules.
   EVIDENCE: "The most plausible way to explain this is to say that you know the relevant semantic rules: you know the rules that assign meaning to ''Greenland'', ''purple'', and so on; and you also know the rules that assign meanings to complex expressions containing these terms on the basis of the meanings of the latter."

163. VIEW: Chomsky provides powerful arguments for the view that people understand sentences based on knowledge of semantic rules.
   EVIDENCE: "(See Chomsky (1980, 1988) for powerful arguments on behalf of this view.)"

164. VIEW: If the direct-referentialist's position is correct, what is communicated by (40) will be identical or at least equivalent with (41).
   EVIDENCE: "an argument exactly similar to that just given establishes that what is communicated (not literally meant) by: (40) ''the rst postmaster general snored'' will be identical or at least equivalent with: (41) exactly one object x was a unique rst postmaster general; moreover, x snored."

165. VIEW: The direct referentialist holds that for some object O, the bare singular proposition (33) is the literal meaning of (40).
   EVIDENCE: "the direct referentialist does indeed hold that, for some object O, the bare singular proposition: (33) O snored is the literal meaning of (40)"

166. VIEW: Exactly one thing x uniquely invented bifocals, and exactly one thing y was a unique first postmaster general, and x=y.
   EVIDENCE: "exactly one thing x uniquely invented bifocals, and exactly one thing y was a unique rst postmaster general; moreover, x=y."

167. VIEW: Direct referentialism can account for the fact that (42) is non-trivial in terms of what it communicates.
   EVIDENCE: "So direct referentialism has no trouble accounting for the fact that, in terms of what it communicates, (42) is non-trivial."

168. VIEW: According to Russell's theory, either (43) itself, or some proposition logically equivalent with (43), is what is meant by (42).
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, according to Russell's theory, either (43) itself, or some proposition logically equivalent with (43), is what is meant by (42)."

169. VIEW: Direct referentialism has many of the virtues that are ascribed to the Theory of Descriptions.
   EVIDENCE: "We are seeing that direct referentialism has many of the virtues that are ascribed to the Theory of Descriptions."

170. VIEW: Direct referentialism explains why (5) and (6) differ in respect of cognitive value.
   EVIDENCE: "Direct referentialism readily explains why (5) and (6) differ in respect of cognitive value"

171. VIEW: Direct referentialism explains why (42) is non-trivial.
   EVIDENCE: "and also why (42) is non-trivial."

172. VIEW: Direct referentialism accounts for the fact that (5) is ambiguous between wide-scope and narrow-scope readings in terms of what utterances of it communicate.
   EVIDENCE: "Further, direct referentialism readily accounts for the fact that, in terms of what utterances of it communicate, (5) is ambiguous between ''wide- scope'' (de re) and ''narrow-scope'' (de dicto) readings."

173. VIEW: The Theory of Descriptions cannot be preferred to referentialism on the grounds that the latter is inconsistent with the facts concerning what is communicated by sentences containing definite descriptions.
   EVIDENCE: "So if the Theory of Descriptions is to be preferred to referentialism, it cannot, contrary to what is widely assumed, be on the grounds that the latter is inconsistent with the facts concerning what is communicated by sentences containing de nite descriptions"

174. VIEW: Direct referentialism, if correct, is no threat to extensionality.
   EVIDENCE: "But what is important in this context is that direct referentialism, supposing it correct, is no threat to extensionality."

175. VIEW: If direct referentialism is correct, (5) and (6) coincide in respect of literal meaning and truth-value, as do (36) and (38).
   EVIDENCE: "As we saw earlier, if direct referentialism is correct, (5) and (6) coincide in respect of literal meaning, and therefore in respect of truth-value, as do (36) and (38)."

176. VIEW: The view that (5) and (6) must differ in respect of literal meaning due to their differences in what they communicate is misguided.
   EVIDENCE: "But such a view, we have just seen, is quite misguided."

177. VIEW: The direct-referentialist's view is that the sense of a definite description doesn't make it into the proposition meant by the sentence in which that definite description occurs.
   EVIDENCE: "We've considered the direct-referentialist's view, according to which the sense of a de nite description doesn't make it into the proposition meant by the sentence in which that de nite description occurs."

178. VIEW: Definite descriptions are quantifiers according to one view.
   EVIDENCE: "We've also considered the view that de nite descriptions are quanti ers."

179. VIEW: Substitution-failures involving definite descriptions don't threaten extensionality if we focus only on the direct-referentialist and quantifier views.
   EVIDENCE: "And we've seen that, if we focus only these two views, then substitution-failures involving de nite descriptions don't threaten extensionality."

180. VIEW: There is a third possibility to consider, that definite descriptions are devices of indirect reference, which was Frege's view.
   EVIDENCE: "But there is a third possibility to consider, viz. that de nite descriptions are devices of indirect reference. (This was Frege's view.)"

181. VIEW: The indirect referentialist says that 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to Benjamin Franklin.
   EVIDENCE: "First, ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to Benjamin Franklin."

182. VIEW: The indirect referentialist rejects Russell's Theory of Descriptions.
   EVIDENCE: "(Thus, the indirect referentialist rejects Russell's Theory of Descriptions.)"

183. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by (32) does not have Benjamin Franklin himself as a constituent but has a concept under which Benjamin Franklin uniquely falls.
   EVIDENCE: "But the proposition literally meant by (32) does not have Benjamin Franklin himself as a constituent. Rather that proposition has as a constituent some concept (or ''sense'', as Frege put it) under which Benjamin Franklin uniquely falls."

184. VIEW: If a sentence S has the form '...the inventor of bifocals...', then S encodes a proposition that has as a constituent a concept C such that the referent of 'the inventor of bifocals' satisfies C.
   EVIDENCE: "More generally, according to the indirect referentialist, if a sentence S has the form ''. . .the inventor of bifocals. . .'', then in virtue of that fact S encodes a proposition that has as a constituent a concept C such that the referent of ''the inventor of bifocals'' satis es C."

185. VIEW: If a sentence S has the form '...the phi...', then S encodes a proposition that has as a constituent a concept C such that the referent of 'the phi' satisfies C.
   EVIDENCE: "Even more generally, if a sentence S has the form ''. . .the phi. . .'',then in virtue of that fact S encodes a proposition that has as a constituent a concept C such that the referent of ''the phi'' satis es C."

186. VIEW: P is true in world w if O snored
   EVIDENCE: "world w, P is true in w just in case O snored"

187. VIEW: P is true if (33) is true
   EVIDENCE: "P is true just in case (33) is true"

   EVIDENCE: "the proposition meant by (44) is true in any possible world just in case Benjamin Franklin snored in that world"

   EVIDENCE: "the proposition meant by S is true in a world W just in case. . .O. . .(i.e. just in case O has property. . .x. . .)"

192. VIEW: 'Benjamin Franklin' refers to Benjamin Franklin
   EVIDENCE: "we know that ''Benjamin Franklin'' is a paradigm-case of an expression that refers to Benjamin Franklin"

193. VIEW: 'Benjamin Franklin' directly refers to Benjamin Franklin
   EVIDENCE: "It is also a paradigm-case of an expression that directly refers to Benjamin Franklin."

194. VIEW: The proposition meant by (32) is true in many worlds where (33) is false if the indirect referentialist is right

   EVIDENCE: "it is false in many worlds where (33) is true"

196. VIEW: PIR is true in exactly the same worlds as PTD
   EVIDENCE: "PIRis true in exactly the same worlds as PTD"

197. VIEW: PIR being true in the same worlds as PTD does not show they are identical
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, this last point does not by itself show that PIRis identical with PTD"

198. VIEW: PIR being true in the same worlds as PTD suggests PIR is a quantified generalization
   EVIDENCE: "But it does strongly suggest, if it doesn't outright entail, that PIRis identical with some quanti ed generalization"

199. VIEW: There are semantic similarities between indirect reference and quantification
   EVIDENCE: "there are many semantic similarities between indirect reference (so-called) and quanti cation"

200. VIEW: There are no significant semantic differences between indirect reference and quantification
   EVIDENCE: "in fact, there don't seem to be any signi cant semantic differences between them"

201. VIEW: There are semantic differences between expressions that directly refer and those that refer indirectly
   EVIDENCE: "there are clear semantic differences between, on the one hand, expressions that are clearly devices of reference (e.g. ''Benjamin Franklin'') and, on the other hand, expressions that refer ''indirectly.''"

202. VIEW: PIR is not significantly different from PTD from a proof-theoretic standpoint

206. VIEW: A quantifier is an expression that answers a question of the form 'how many phi's are psi's?'
   EVIDENCE: "general, a quanti er is an expression that, when embedded in a sentence, answers a question of the form ''how many phi's are psi's?''"

207. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, (32) is logically equivalent to the proposition that exactly one thing invented bifocals and any such thing is tall
   EVIDENCE: "If the indirect referentialist is right, (32) is logically equivalent with the proposition: exactly one thing invented bifocals, and any such thing is tall."

208. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, (32) answers the question 'how many things are bifocal-inventors?'
   EVIDENCE: "So, if the indirect referentialist is right, then (32) answers two questions of the form ''how many phi's are psi's?''It answers the question: ''how many things are bifocal-inventors?''"

209. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, (32) answers the question 'how many bifocal-inventors snored?'
   EVIDENCE: "and it also answers the question ''how many bifocal-inventors snored?''"

210. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, 'the inventor of bifocals' is quantifier-like in some important respects
   EVIDENCE: "So if the indirect referentialist is right, ''the inventor of bifocals'' would seem, at the very least, to be quanti er-like in some important respects"

211. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, the semantics of 'the inventor of bifocals' is extremely similar to the semantics that the Russellian ascribes to it
   EVIDENCE: "What we are seeing is that, if the indirect referentialist is right, the semantics of ''the inventor of bifocals'' is, at the very least, extremely similar to the semantics that the Russellian ascribes to it."

212. VIEW: If the indirect referentialist is right, 'the inventor of bifocals' is semantically very different from any instance of an expression that clearly refers to Benjamin Franklin
   EVIDENCE: "We are also seeing that, if the indirect referentialist is right, ''the inventor of bifocals'' is semantically very different from any instance of an expression that clearly refers to Benjamin Franklin"

213. VIEW: Clear-cut cases of reference have significant similarities with cases of indirect reference
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, it would be an overstatement to say that clear-cut cases of reference have no signi cant similarities with cases of indirect reference."

214. VIEW: Similarities between clear-cut cases of reference and clear-cut cases of quantification give no more weight to the position that definite descriptions are devices of reference than they do to the position that they are quantifiers
   EVIDENCE: "But to the extent that there are such similarities, those same similarities are also found between clear- cut cases of reference, on the one hand, and clear-cut cases of quanti cation, on the other. For that reason, those similarities give no more weight to the position that de nite descriptions are devices of reference than they do to the position that they are quanti ers."

215. VIEW: A complete sentence can be formed by replacing the variable 'x' in 'x snored' with either 'Benjamin Franklin' or 'the inventor of bifocals'
   EVIDENCE: "Given the open sentence ''x snored'',a complete sentence can be formed by replacing the variable with either ''Benjamin Franklin'' or ''the inventor of bifocals.''"

216. VIEW: The fact that a well-formed sentence results when 'Benjamin Franklin' replaces the variable is to be understood in terms of the semantics of 'Benjamin Franklin'
   EVIDENCE: "By parity of reasoning, the fact that a well-formed sentence results when ''Benjamin Franklin'' replaces the variable is to be understood, at least up to a point, in terms of the semantics of ''Benjamin Franklin.''"

217. VIEW: The semantic job of 'Benjamin Franklin' is to pick out some entity or other
   EVIDENCE: "More precisely, it is to be understood, up to a point, in terms of the fact that the semantic job of ''Benjamin Franklin'' is to pick out some entity or other."

218. VIEW: The exact identity of the entity picked out by 'Benjamin Franklin' is irrelevant in this context
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, it is relevant in this context is that ''Benjamin Franklin'' pick out some entity or other; the exact identity of that entity is irrelevant."

219. VIEW: Replacing the variable with a quantifier like 'some person' results in a meaningful sentence
   EVIDENCE: "After all, a meaningful sentence results if the variable is replaced with a quanti er (e.g. ''some person'')."

220. VIEW: The expression 'and snores' is meaningless when taken as a complete utterance
   EVIDENCE: "Taken as a complete utterance, the expression ''and snores'' is meaningless."

221. VIEW: The reason 'and snores' is meaningless is that 'and' doesn't combine with 'snores' in the right way
   EVIDENCE: "The reason is that ''and'' doesn't combine with ''snores'' in the right way: it has the wrong combinatorial properties-the wrong syntax, in other words."

222. VIEW: 'The inventor of bifocals' and 'Benjamin Franklin' have similar combinatorial-syntactic properties
   EVIDENCE: "And the reason that both ''the inventor of bifocals snored'' and ''Benjamin Franklin snored'' are meaningful is that ''the inventor of bifocals'' and ''Benjamin Franklin'' do have similar combinatorial-syntactic properties"

223. VIEW: The reason 'the inventor of bifocals snored' and 'Benjamin Franklin snored' are meaningful is not that they have similar semantic properties
   EVIDENCE: "the reason is not that they have the similar semantic properties."

224. VIEW: 'Some man' has the right syntactic properties to form a meaningful sentence like 'some man snored'
   EVIDENCE: "After all, ''some man'', no less than ''Benjamin Franklin'', has the right syntactic properties (''some man snored'' is no less meaningful than ''Benjamin Franklin snored'')."

225. VIEW: 'Some man' is semantically very different from any singular term
   EVIDENCE: "And if Russell and Frege have taught us anything, it is that ''some man'' is semantically very different from any singular term."

226. VIEW: If E occurs in S, then S contains a sentence that answers a question of the form 'how many phi's are psi's?'
   EVIDENCE: "if E occurs in S, then S ipso facto contains a sentence that answers a question of the form ''how many phi's are psi's?''"

227. VIEW: The definition of a quantifier, though an improvement on McCawley's, still falls short
   EVIDENCE: "This de nition, though an improvement on McCawley's, still falls short"

228. VIEW: The reason the definition falls short is that it deals only with sentences in the indicative mood
   EVIDENCE: "the reason being that it deals only with sentences in the indicative mood"

229. VIEW: The sentence 'are some people are happy?' doesn't answer any question of the form 'how many phi's are psi's?'
   EVIDENCE: "The sentence ''are some people are happy?'' doesn't answer any question of the form ''how many phi's are psi's?''"

230. VIEW: The sentence 'are some people are happy?' doesn't answer any question because it is itself a question
   EVIDENCE: "since it doesn't answer any question, given that it is itself a question"

231. VIEW: The proposition encoded in the sentence 'are some people are happy?' does answer a question of the form 'how many phi's are psi's?'
   EVIDENCE: "But the proposition encoded in (though not af rmed by) that sentence does answer such a question"

232. VIEW: The proposition encoded in the sentence 'are some people are happy?' is that some people are happy
   EVIDENCE: "that proposition being: that some people are happy"

233. VIEW: A quantifier is an expression E such that, if a sentence S contains E, S encodes a proposition that answers a question of the form 'how many phi's are psi's?'
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, a quanti er is an expression E such that, if a sentence S contains E, S ipso facto encodes (though it doesn't necessarily af rm) a proposition that answers a question of the form ''how many phi's are psi's?''"

234. VIEW: The similarities between 'the inventor of bifocals' and other expressions are syntactic, not semantic, in nature
   EVIDENCE: "''the inventor of bifocals'' seem to be syntactic, not semantic, in nature"

235. VIEW: Given that reference is a semantic function, the syntactic similarities do not support the contention that 'the inventor of bifocals' is anything other than a quantifier
   EVIDENCE: "But given that reference is a semantic function, those similarities don't support the contention that ''the inventor of bifocals'' (supposing, as we momentarily are, that it is a device of indirect reference) is anything other than a quanti er"

236. VIEW: Indirect referentialism is committed to an incoherent semantic view
   EVIDENCE: "Why indirect referentialism is committed to an incoherent semantic view"

237. VIEW: Indirect reference is identical with Russellian quantification
   EVIDENCE: "There is yet another reason to think that indirect reference (so-called) is identical with Russellian quanti cation"

238. VIEW: Indirect referentialism is merely a confused version of Russellianism
   EVIDENCE: "that, more precisely, indirect referentialism is merely a confused version of Russellianism"

239. VIEW: The essence of the indirect-referentialist's position is that a sentence S has for its meaning a proposition that has as one of its constituents a concept that O uniquely satisfies
   EVIDENCE: "Remember that the essence of the indirect-referentialist's position is as follows (it is to be supposed that O is the one and only object having property phi): In virtue of having the form ''. . .the phi. . .'', a sentence S has for its meaning a proposition that has as one of its constituents, not O itself, but rather some concept that O uniquely satis es, that concept being: unique instance of phi"

240. VIEW: Indirect referentialism, taken in conjunction with the principle of compositionality, has extremely counterintuitive consequences
   EVIDENCE: "We know from Frege that, taken in conjunction with an extremely plausible semantic principle, indirect referentialism has some extremely counterintuitive consequences"

241. VIEW: The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its constituents
   EVIDENCE: "The principle in question is this: the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its constituents"

242. VIEW: Special compositionality states that the referent of a complex referring term is a function of the referents of its constituents
   EVIDENCE: "A related principle is that the referent of a complex referring term is a function of the referents of its constituents"

243. VIEW: Compositionality and special compositionality are extremely plausible principles
   EVIDENCE: "Obviously compositionality and special compositionality are extremely plausible principles"

244. VIEW: The indirect referentialist holds that 'the inventor of bifocals' and 'the first postmaster general' are referring terms that co-refer given certain historical facts
   EVIDENCE: "The indirect referentialist (unlike the Russellian) holds that ''the inventor of bifocals'' and ''the rst postmaster general'' are referring terms and that, given certain facts about history, they therefore co-refer"

245. VIEW: If indirect referentialism is right, then 'Fred believes that the inventor of bifocals snored' and 'Fred believes that the first postmaster general snored' differ in meaning and potentially in truth-value
   EVIDENCE: "As we've noted, if indirect referentialism is right, then: (36) ''Fred believesthat the inventor of bifocals snored'' and (38) ''Fred believes that the rst postmaster general snored'' differ in meaning and also (potentially) in truth-value"

246. VIEW: Galileo's words mean the same in different contexts
   EVIDENCE: "'Galileo said that,' mean anything other than is their wont when they come in other environments.'"

247. VIEW: Davidson argues that Frege's view is inconsistent with the learnability of languages
   EVIDENCE: "Davidson argues (cogently, in my opinion) that Frege's view is inconsistent with the fact that languages are learnable."

248. VIEW: A sentence with the form '...the phi...' has a meaning related to something uniquely having phi
   EVIDENCE: "In virtue of having the form ''. . .the phi. . .'',a sentence has for its meaning the proposition something O uniquely has phi and. . .O. . .or, if that not exact proposition, then some other, logically equivalent, quanti ed generalization."

249. VIEW: The Theory of Descriptions has a single rule for the semantics of definite descriptions
   EVIDENCE: "One virtue of the Theory of Descriptions is that there is some one rule (namely TD) such that, given any occurrence of a given de nite description, the semantics of that occurrence is given by that rule."

250. VIEW: Russell's theory applies a single rule to the semantics of 'the inventor of bifocals' across different sentences
   EVIDENCE: "So, for example, Russell's theory has the virtue that there is some one rule such that the semantics of the occurrence of ''the inventor of bifocals'' in each of (32), (36), (46), and (47) is given by that rule."

251. VIEW: A sentence containing 'the phi' within the scope of an operator can be assigned multiple meanings by TD
   EVIDENCE: "In that case, (TD) assigns (at least) two different meanings to S and Russell's theory thus says that S is ambiguous between those two meanings."

252. VIEW: Russell's theory suggests that sentence (36) is ambiguous between two meanings
   EVIDENCE: "For example, as we've discussed, if Russell's theory is right, then (36) is ambiguous between (36WS) and (36NS)."

253. VIEW: There is a single rule for understanding the semantics of definite descriptions despite potential ambiguity
   EVIDENCE: "But this doesn't mean that, if Russell's theory is right, there is not some one rule in terms of which the semantics of occurrences of de nite descriptions can be understood."

254. VIEW: Indirect referentialism implies that 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to different things in different sentences
   EVIDENCE: "We've seen that, if that doctrine is right, then ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to one thing in (32), a second thing in (36), a third thing in (47), and so on."

255. VIEW: Indirect referentialism posits a single rule for how the truth-conditions of a sentence are affected by a definite description
   EVIDENCE: "If indirect referentialism is right, then given any occurrence O of ''the inventor of bifocals'' in any sentence S, there is somesinglerule saying how S's truth-conditions are affected by virtue of its containing O."

256. VIEW: A sentence with the form '...the phi...' under indirect referentialism has the concept phi as a constituent
   EVIDENCE: "As we've noted, if indirect referentialism is right, then in virtue of having the form ''. . .the phi. . .'' a sentence S has the conceptphias a constituent and, further, S is true just in case something O uniquely instantiatesphi and. . .O. . ."

257. VIEW: Indirect referentialism's rule (IR) states that a sentence's literal meaning is true if something uniquely has phi
   EVIDENCE: "(IR) In virtue of having the form ''. . .the phi. . .'',a sentence has for its literal meaning a proposition that is true just in case something O uniquely has phi and, moreover,. . .O. . ."

258. VIEW: Sentences containing definite descriptions can be ambiguous under indirect referentialism
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, if (IR) is a correct characterization of the semantics of de nite descriptions, then some sentences containing de nite descriptions are, in virtue of that fact, ambiguous."

259. VIEW: Indirect referentialism maintains a single rule for the semantics of definite descriptions despite potential ambiguity
   EVIDENCE: "But (to echo what we said a moment ago) this doesn't mean that, if indirect referentialism is correct, there is not some one rule in terms of which the semantics of any occurrence of a de nite descriptions is to be understood."

260. VIEW: Indirect referentialism implies that 'the inventor of bifocals' has the same semantic effect across different sentences
   EVIDENCE: "So if indirect referentialism is right, there is some one rule that correctly characterizes the semantics of the occurrence of ''the inventor of bifocals'' in (32), and that also correctly characterizes the semantics of the corresponding occurrences in (36), (46), and (47)."

261. VIEW: The propositions meant by (36) are identical with either (36WS) or (36NS), or any other quantified generalization.
   EVIDENCE: "the propositions that, in his view, are meant by (36) are identical with either (36WS) or with (36NS), or indeed with any other quanti ed generalization."

262. VIEW: The essence of the author's position is that definite descriptions are referring terms, not quantifiers.
   EVIDENCE: "For the essence of his position is that de nite descriptions are referring terms, not quanti ers."

263. VIEW: Indirect referentialists hold that the propositions meant by (36) are logically equivalent with quantified generalizations.
   EVIDENCE: "But, as we've observed, the indirect referentialist holds that, nonetheless, the propositions meant, in his view, by (36) are logically equivalent with quanti ed generalizations of the kind just described."

264. VIEW: No two of the sentences discussed have the same meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, no two of those sentences have the same meaning."

265. VIEW: The difference in meaning between sentences is not due to 'the inventor of bifocals' doing different semantic work in those sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "But that isn't because, semantically, ''the inventor of bifocals'' is doing different things in those sentences."

266. VIEW: The phrase 'the inventor of bifocals' does the same semantic work in all sentences despite shifts in the surrounding verbiage.
   EVIDENCE: "It is, on the contrary, because it is doing the same semantic work in all of those sentences despite the shifts in the verbiage anking it."

267. VIEW: The word 'Tom' has the same meaning in both 'Tom is tall' and 'Tom is lonely'.
   EVIDENCE: "The word ''Tom'' has the same meaning in both ''Tom is tall'' and ''Tom is lonely.''"

268. VIEW: It would be absurd to conclude that the semantics of 'Tom' in one sentence is different from its semantics in another sentence.
   EVIDENCE: "But it would be absurd to conclude on that account that the semantics of ''Tom'' in the one sentence wasn't identical with its semantics in the other."

269. VIEW: The semantics of 'the inventor of bifocals' is the same across sentences (32), (36), (47), and (48).
   EVIDENCE: "What we just said about ''Tom'' vis-a`-vis those two sentences holds with respect to ''the inventor of bifocals'' vis-a`-vis sentences (32), (36), (47) and (48)."

270. VIEW: Two expression-occurrences can be semantically identical but referentially distinct.
   EVIDENCE: "the referential facts: two expression-occurrences can be semantically identical but referentially distinct."

271. VIEW: The view that the semantics of an expression can change without changing is absurd.
   EVIDENCE: "But, given that reference is a semantic function par excellence, that amounts to the absurd view that the semantics of an expression can change without changing."

272. VIEW: For 'Benjamin Franklin' to refer to an object O, it is necessary that sentences of the form 'Benjamin Franklin has phi' attribute phi to O.
   EVIDENCE: "So for ''Benjamin Franklin'' to refer to O, it is surely necessary that sentences of the form ''Benjamin Franklin has phi'' attribute phi to O."

273. VIEW: For 'Benjamin Franklin' to refer to an object O, it is sufficient that sentences of the form 'Benjamin Franklin has phi' attribute phi to O.
   EVIDENCE: "It is also suf cient. Suppose (what is in fact true) that, in virtue of having the form, ''Benjamin Franklin has phi'' a sentence attributed phi to O."

274. VIEW: The concept of reference involves occurrences of an expression affecting the truth-conditions or meanings of sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "But they give some weight to the idea (implicit in the work of Frege (1956, 1974) and Tarski (1983), and explicitly stated by Dummett (1973), Tughendat (1970), and others) that for E to refer to O is for it to be the case that occurrences of E have certain effects on the truth- conditions (or meanings) of sentences comprising those occurrences."

275. VIEW: If indirect referentialism is correct, two expression-occurrences can have the same effect on the truth-conditions of their host-sentences but refer to different things.
   EVIDENCE: "We've seen that, if indirect referentialism is correct, then two expression-occurrences can have the very same effect on the truth-conditions of their host-sentences and yet refer to completely different things."

276. VIEW: If indirect referentialism is correct, what an expression refers to is independent of its semantic function.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, if indirect referentialism is correct, what an expression refers to is independent of what it is doing semantically, and reference therefore isn't xed by semantics."

277. VIEW: The position that reference is not fixed by semantics is absurd.
   EVIDENCE: "But, to echo what we said earlier, such a position borders on absurdity, given that nothing is more distinctively semantic than reference."

278. VIEW: Indirect referentialism is similar to Russell's Theory of Descriptions.
   EVIDENCE: "Notice how similar (IR) is to (TD). This is consistent with our point that indirect referentialism is really just a form of Russell's Theory of Descriptions."

279. VIEW: Russell's theory has a distinct advantage over indirect referentialism because it denies that 'the inventor of bifocals' is a referring term.
   EVIDENCE: "But Russell's theory has a distinct advantage over indirect referentialism. Russell's theory denies that ''the inventor of bifocals'' is a referring term."

280. VIEW: Russell's theory does not require special compositionality to hold that 'the inventor of bifocals' refers to different things in different sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "So Russell's theory is not required by special compositionality to hold that ''the inventor of bifocals'' refers to one thing in (32), a second thing in (36), and so on."

281. VIEW: The fact that terms would change meaning and truth-value does not threaten extensionality.
   EVIDENCE: "terms would change meaning and truth-value, that fact does not threaten extensionality."

282. VIEW: Indirect referentialism is a conflation of several distinct notions.
   EVIDENCE: "Indirect referentialism a con ation of several distinct notions"

283. VIEW: The idea that definite descriptions are devices of indirect reference is an incoherent synthesis of estimable views.
   EVIDENCE: "The idea that de nite descriptions are devices of indirect reference is an incoherent synthesis of a number of otherwise estimable views."

284. VIEW: The semantics of 'the king of France is bald' is such that an utterance is true if there is exactly one king of France who is bald at the time of utterance.
   EVIDENCE: "The semantics of ''the king of France is bald'' is obviously such that an utterance of that sentence is true just in case, at the time of utterance, there is exactly one king of France x and, moreover, x be bald."

285. VIEW: Anyone who understands the sentence 'the king of France is bald' knows that its truth depends on the italicized proposition being true.
   EVIDENCE: "So anyone who knows the semantics of that sentence, i.e. anyone who understands it, knows that an utterance of it is true just in case the same holds of the italicized proposition, a consequence being that such an utterance communicates that proposition."

286. VIEW: Utterances of the form '...the phi...' communicate a proposition that is true if the concept phi is uniquely instantiated by some object O.
   EVIDENCE: "In general, an utterance of ''. . .the phi. . .'' communicates a proposition that is true just in case the concept (or property) phi is uniquely instantiated by some object O and...O. . ."

287. VIEW: The fact that utterances of the form '...the phi...' communicate certain propositions has a semantic basis.
   EVIDENCE: "And this fact about what such utterances communicate obviously has a semantic basis."

288. VIEW: It is reasonable to take the view that what is literally meant by an utterance of the form '...the phi...' is equivalent to an existence-claim.
   EVIDENCE: "Given only these facts, it seems reasonable, if not positively de rigueur, to take the view that what is literally meant by such an utterance is equivalent with an existence-claim of the kind just described."

289. VIEW: A sentence of the form '...the phi...' has for its literal meaning a proposition with the property phi as a constituent.
   EVIDENCE: "And given that view, it readily follows that, in virtue of having the form of ''. . .the phi. . .'',a sentence has for its literal meaning a proposition having as a constituent the property phi."

290. VIEW: The sentence '(32)' has for its literal meaning a proposition with a property that Benjamin Franklin uniquely instantiates as a constituent, not Benjamin Franklin himself.
   EVIDENCE: "It follows, for example, that (32) has for its literal meaning a proposition having as a constituent, not Benjamin Franklin himself, but rather some property (or concept) that he uniquely instantiates."

291. VIEW: Definite descriptions seem very much to be devices of reference.
   EVIDENCE: "Then there is the fact that de nite descriptions seem very much to be devices of reference."

292. VIEW: It is hard to believe that 'the number that is identical with two' does not refer to the number two.
   EVIDENCE: "It is hard to believe that ''the number that is identical with two'' (or simply ''the number two'') doesn't refer to the number two."

293. VIEW: The facts described rule out direct referentialism.
   EVIDENCE: "The facts described in the second to last paragraph seem to rule out direct referentialism."

294. VIEW: The fact described rules out Russell's Theory of Descriptions.
   EVIDENCE: "The fact described in the paragraph just before this one rules out Russell's Theory of Descriptions."

295. VIEW: Out of the three possibilities for what definite descriptions could be, only indirect reference seems to be on the right side of the points made.
   EVIDENCE: "Out of the three possibilities as to what de nite J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2314-23462331 descriptions could be-devices of direct reference, devices of indirect reference, and quanti ers-only the second seems to be on the right side of the points made in the last two paragraphs."

296. VIEW: Indirect referentialism seems to be a highly reasonable semantic position.
   EVIDENCE: "Indirect referentialism thus seems to be a highly reasonable semantic position."

297. VIEW: Indirect referentialism, so far as it isn't incoherent, collapses into Russell's theory.
   EVIDENCE: "But we saw that, so far as it isn't incoherent, indirect referentialism collapses into Russell's theory."

298. VIEW: There must be a non-sequitur in the argument presented.
   EVIDENCE: "This shows that there must be a non-sequitur in the argument just presented."

299. VIEW: The non-sequitur in the argument is not hard to identify.
   EVIDENCE: "Given what we said earlier, that non-sequitur is not to hard to identify."

300. VIEW: While a sentence S communicates a proposition, it does not follow that such a proposition is what is literally meant by S.
   EVIDENCE: "While it is true that S communicates a proposition of the kind earlier described, and while it is true that this fact has a basis in the semantics of that sentence, it doesn't follow such a proposition is what is literally meant by S."

301. VIEW: (49) does entail (51)
   EVIDENCE: "We have seen that, contrary to what Quine assumes, (49) does entail (51)."

302. VIEW: There is some x such that x is identical with Venus and is therefore identical with each of Hesperus and Phosphorous
   EVIDENCE: "After all, there is some x (such that x is identical with Venus and is therefore identical with each of Hesperus and Phosphorous)"

303. VIEW: Both sentences encode the proposition: x is lovely
   EVIDENCE: "such that both sentences encode the proposition: x is lovely."

304. VIEW: (49) and (51) may communicate propositions that differ in truth-value
   EVIDENCE: "We have also seen why, that fact notwithstanding, (49) and (51) may communicate propositions that differ in truth-value."

305. VIEW: Kaplan had in mind points similar to these when he wrote about Fregean sinn
   EVIDENCE: "I believe that Kaplan (1989b:560) had in mind points similar to these when he wrote: Fregean sinn con ates elements of two quite different notions of meaning."

306. VIEW: Fregean sinn con ates elements of two quite different notions of meaning
   EVIDENCE: "Fregean sinn con ates elements of two quite different notions of meaning."

307. VIEW: One notion of meaning is character, which is close to the idea of linguistic meaning
   EVIDENCE: "One, which I called character, is close to the idea of linguistic meaning (and perhaps of cognitive content)."

308. VIEW: Another notion of meaning is content, which is what is said by an expression in a particular context of use
   EVIDENCE: "Another, which I call content, is what is said by an expression in a particular context of use."

309. VIEW: The content of an utterance of a complete sentence-token is a truth-bearing proposition
   EVIDENCE: "The content of an utterance of a complete [sentence-token] is a truth-bearing proposition."

310. VIEW: Where indexicals are involved, the difference between character and content is quite clear
   EVIDENCE: "Where indexicals are involved, the difference between character and content is quite clear."

311. VIEW: Quine does not adopt the Fregean view that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorous' refer to their respective senses in epistemic and modal contexts
   EVIDENCE: "Quine does not, at least not in this context, adopt the Fregean view that ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorous'' refer to their respective senses, and thus don't co-refer, in epistemic and modal contexts."

312. VIEW: Kaplan's alternative to Quine's analysis depends on the assumption that names are synonymous with definite descriptions
   EVIDENCE: "Kaplan's (1968) alterative to Quine's analysis depends on the assumption, shown by Kripke (1980) to be false, that names are synonymous with de nite descriptions."

313. VIEW: The assumption that names are synonymous with definite descriptions is false
   EVIDENCE: "shown by Kripke (1980) to be false, that names are synonymous with de nite descriptions."

314. VIEW: Kaplan's attempt to produce a Kripke-friendly alternative to Quine's analysis is not only false but also incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "Kaplan's (1986)attempt to produce a Kripke-friendly alternative to Quine's analysis is not only false but also incoherent, since an essential part of it is the tautologically false contention that extensional contexts are substitution-intolerant."

315. VIEW: An essential part of Kaplan's attempt is the tautologically false contention that extensional contexts are substitution-intolerant
   EVIDENCE: "since an essential part of it is the tautologically false contention that extensional contexts are substitution-intolerant."

316. VIEW: Quine believes that modal concepts are incoherent and that the use of modal connectives has no place in coherent discourse
   EVIDENCE: "Quine believes that modal concepts (e.g. the concept of necessity) are incoherent and that the use of modal connectives (e. g. ''necessarily'') therefore has no place in coherent discourse."

317. VIEW: If (52) is meaningful, it is true
   EVIDENCE: "There is little doubt that, if it is meaningful, (52) is true."

318. VIEW: (52) is true because 9 has the property expressed by the open sentence (53)
   EVIDENCE: "Supposing that (52) is in fact true, that is because 9 has the property expressed by the open sentence: (53) ''necessarily, x is larger than 7.''"

319. VIEW: A true sentence results if we replace the variable in (53) with any expression that co-refers with '9'
   EVIDENCE: "Presumably, a true sentence results if we replace the variable with any expression (of English) that co-refers with ''9.''"

320. VIEW: (54) is a false sentence that results from substituting 'the number of planets' for '9' in (52)
   EVIDENCE: "But this is not the case, given that (54) ''necessarily, the number of planets is greater than 7'' is a false sentence that results from just such a substitution."

321. VIEW: There is no language satisfying the condition in question.
   EVIDENCE: "as a matter of empirical fact, there is no language satisfying the condition in question."

334. VIEW: Pierre understands the English sentence 'it is not the case London is pretty.'
   EVIDENCE: "Pierre understands (58)."

335. VIEW: Pierre rationally assents to both a proposition and its negation.
   EVIDENCE: "Pierre assents both to a proposition and its negation and he is not in the slightest bit irrational."

336. VIEW: To be irrational is to countenance some inconsistent set of propositions.
   EVIDENCE: "to be irrational just is to countenance some inconsistent set of propositions."

337. VIEW: The sense/reference distinction cannot solve the problem of Pierre's rational assent to contradictory propositions.
   EVIDENCE: "we cannot use the sense/reference distinction to solve the problem."

338. VIEW: 'London' and 'Londres' cannot differ in sense because they are translations of each other.
   EVIDENCE: "Being translations of each other, ''London'' and ''Londres'' cannot differ in sense."

339. VIEW: Frege's semantics cannot solve the problem of Pierre's rational assent to contradictory propositions.
   EVIDENCE: "So even if Frege's semantics is correct, it won't solve the problem."

340. VIEW: 'London' and 'Londres' cannot differ in quantificational content because they are translations of each other.
   EVIDENCE: "Being translations of each other, ''London'' and ''Londres'' cannot differ in quanti cational content."

341. VIEW: Russell's semantics cannot solve the problem of Pierre's rational assent to contradictory propositions.
   EVIDENCE: "So even if Russell's semantics is correct, this won't solve the problem."

342. VIEW: Kripke has shown that Frege's and Russell's views on the semantics of proper names do not settle the problems they are meant to settle.
   EVIDENCE: "Kripke has thus shown that, even if Frege's views and Russell's views concerning the semantics of proper names are correct, this does not settle the problems those views are meant to settle."

343. VIEW: Kripke has identified an important puzzle regarding Pierre's rational assent to contradictory propositions.
   EVIDENCE: "Kripke has also identi ed an important puzzle: Pierre rationally assents to sentences that he correctly understands and that negate each other."

344. VIEW: The semantic value of both 'London' and 'Londres' is London.
   EVIDENCE: "The semantic value of each of ''London'' and ''Londres'' is London."

345. VIEW: Both 'London' and 'Londres' refer directly to London.
   EVIDENCE: "each expression refers to directly to London"

346. VIEW: The wide-scope reading of the proposition is that it is not the case that there is an awful place x with certain characteristics and that x is pretty.
   EVIDENCE: "The wide-scope reading is: (61) it is not the case that: there is an awful place x such that I am currently imprisoned in x, and such that there is rotting garbage in x's streets, and such that the occupants of x are surly; moreover, x is pretty."

347. VIEW: The narrow-scope reading of the proposition is that there is an awful place x with certain characteristics, but it is not the case that x is pretty.
   EVIDENCE: "The narrow-scope reading is: (62) there is an awful place x such that I am currently imprisoned in x, and such that there is rotting garbage in x's streets, and such that the occupants of x are surly; moreover, it is not the case that x is pretty."

348. VIEW: Under the circumstances, the narrow-scope reading is more likely to be the proposition Pierre associates with 'it is not the case that London is pretty.'
   EVIDENCE: "It is clear that, under the circumstances, (62) is more likely than (61) to be the proposition that Pierre associates with ''it is not the case that London is pretty.''"

349. VIEW: Pierre does not deny the existence of an awful place x with certain characteristics; he denies that x is pretty.
   EVIDENCE: "After all, Pierre doesn't deny that there is an awful place x such that the people in x are surly (and so on)-what Pierre denies is that x is pretty."

350. VIEW: The conjunction of (60) and (62) is not a self-contradiction.
   EVIDENCE: "The conjunction of (60) and (62) is not a self-contradiction, and neither, for that matter, is the conjunction of (60) and (61)."

351. VIEW: The conjunction of (60) and (61) is not a self-contradiction.
   EVIDENCE: "The conjunction of (60) and (62) is not a self-contradiction, and neither, for that matter, is the conjunction of (60) and (61)."

352. VIEW: Pierre associates the proposition (60) with 'Londres est Jolie.'
   EVIDENCE: "The proposition that Pierre associates with ''Londres est Jolie'' is (60), and the proposition that he associates with ''it is not the case that London is pretty'' is either (61) or (62)."

353. VIEW: Pierre associates either (61) or (62) with 'it is not the case that London is pretty.'
   EVIDENCE: "The proposition that Pierre associates with ''Londres est Jolie'' is (60), and the proposition that he associates with ''it is not the case that London is pretty'' is either (61) or (62)."

354. VIEW: Pierre is not guilty of self-contradiction in accepting both 'Londres est jolie' and 'London is not pretty.'
   EVIDENCE: "Given what the propositions are that, under the circumstances in question, Pierre associates with ''Londres est jolie'' and ''London is not pretty'', he is obviously in no way guilty of self-contradiction in virtue of accepting both of them."

355. VIEW: There is no need to posit 'propositional guises' or other dubious entities to understand Pierre's situation.
   EVIDENCE: "We don't need to posit ''propositional guises'' or other dubious entities to understand what is going on."

356. VIEW: The sentences 'London is pretty' and 'Londres est jolie' have the same literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "We don't deny that ''London is pretty'' and ''Londres est jolie'' have the same literal meaning."

357. VIEW: Assenting to inconsistent propositions constitutes irrationality.
   EVIDENCE: "And we don't reject the age-old view that assenting to inconsistent propositions constitutes irrationality."

358. VIEW: The proposition (62) is not inconsistent with (60), and neither is (61).
   EVIDENCE: "After all, (62) is not inconsistent with (60), and neither is (61)."

359. VIEW: Kripke's story initially seems to require jettisoning or qualifying the presumption that the proposition 'x has phi and x does not have phi' is analytically false.
   EVIDENCE: "At rst, Kripke's story seems to make it de rigueur to jettison, or at least qualify, the deeply entrenched presumption that, given an arbitrary object x and an arbitrary property phi, the proposition x has phi and x does not have phi, is analytically false and therefore such that it cannot be rationally accepted."

360. VIEW: It is not necessary to qualify or jettison the presumption that the proposition 'x has phi and x does not have phi' is analytically false.
   EVIDENCE: "Fortunately, it isn't necessary to qualify that presumption, let alone jettison it."

361. VIEW: It is necessary to give due weight to the fact that the information through which Pierre assigns meaning to 'London is pretty' differs from that for 'Londres est Jolie.'
   EVIDENCE: "All that is necessary, we have seen, is to give due weight to the fact that the information through which Pierre assigns meaning to the sentence ''London is pretty'' differs from the information through which he assigns meaning to the sentence ''Londres est Jolie.''"

362. VIEW: According to Nathan Salmon, under some circumstances, it is rational to accept the proposition 'x has phi and x does not have phi.'
   EVIDENCE: "According to Nathan Salmon, however, Kripke's parable does show that, under at least some circumstances, it is rational to accept the proposition xhasphiandxdoesnothavephi."

363. VIEW: A consequence of Salmon's view is that the information at a person's disposal may give them as much reason to accept 'x ≠ x' as 'x = x.'
   EVIDENCE: "Given that phi may be the property of not being identical with x, a consequence of Salmon's view is that the information at a given person's disposal may give that person as much reason to accept the proposition that x6¼x as it does to accept the proposition that x=x."

364. VIEW: Salmon accepts the consequence that there do exist objects that are not self-identical.
   EVIDENCE: "Salmon duly accepts this consequence. Given the presumption that x=x has an epistemic probability of 100%, a consequence of this consequence is that there do exist objects that are not self-identical. True to his own premises, Salmon duly holds that, indeed, there do exist objects that aren't self-identical."

365. VIEW: If Salmon is right and logic is revised accordingly, it would be hard to deny the existence of square circles, even primes greater than two, or other 'surds.'
   EVIDENCE: "Supposing Salmon to be right about this, and supposing the principles of logic to be correspondingly revised, it's hard to see on what grounds one could deny the existence of square circles, even primes greater than two, or of anything else that (relative to pre-Salmonian logic) quali es as a ''surd'', to use the medieval term."

366. VIEW: Revisions of deeply entrenched principles of logic are unnecessary.
   EVIDENCE: "such revisions of deeply entrenched principles of logic...prove to be quite unnecessary"

367. VIEW: People must sometimes exploit semantic information to know what is semantically encoded in the words they use.
   EVIDENCE: "to know what is semantically encoded in the words they use, people must sometimes exploit information that is, in and of itself, semantic"

368. VIEW: Arguments like (EP) are widely seen as cogent in post-Kripke days.
   EVIDENCE: "arguments like the following (in boldface) are widely seen as cogent: (EP)"

369. VIEW: The proposition 'Hesperus is lovely' does not entail the proposition 'Phosphorous is lovely'.
   EVIDENCE: "(NE) The proposition Hesperus is lovely doesn't entail the proposition Phosphorous is lovely"

370. VIEW: Given that Hesperus is Phosphorous, it is impossible for one to be lovely if the other is not.
   EVIDENCE: "given that Hesperus is Phosphorous, it is impossible that one could be lovely if the other were not"

371. VIEW: It is epistemically possible that Hesperus is lovely and Phosphorus is not lovely, but not metaphysically possible.
   EVIDENCE: "while it is epistemically possible that Hesperus is lovely should differ in truth-value from Phosphorus is lovely...it is not actually or, as it is usually put, metaphysically possible"

372. VIEW: There is a distinction between epistemic and metaphysical possibility and necessity.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, there is a distinction between epistemic and metaphysical possibility and, therefore, between epistemic and metaphysical necessity"

373. VIEW: There is reason to question the cogency of the argument distinguishing epistemic and metaphysical necessity.
   EVIDENCE: "we have reason to question the cogency of this argument and, more speci cally, to question at least some (though not necessarily all) of the reasons adduced in favor of the view that metaphysical and epistemic necessity do not coincide"

374. VIEW: The expressions 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorous' both label the same object, the planet Venus.
   EVIDENCE: "There is some object O (such that O is identical with the planet Venus) such that ''Hesperus'' and ''Phosphorous'' both label O"

375. VIEW: At the level of semantics, 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorous' do not bear Fregean senses or Russellian quantifiers.
   EVIDENCE: "those expression do nothing but label O. (So, at the level of semantics, those expressions do not bear Fregean senses and they aren't Russellian quanti ers.)"

376. VIEW: The sentences 'Hesperus is lovely' and 'Phosphorous is lovely' are synonymous at the level of semantics.
   EVIDENCE: "In terms of their semantics, (63) and (64) must therefore be synonymous"

377. VIEW: The claim (EP*) is obviously false.
   EVIDENCE: "But (EP*) is obviously false."

378. VIEW: Sentences with 'Hesperus' or 'Phosphorous' typically communicate existence claims.
   EVIDENCE: "We've seen that, in virtue of having the form ''. . .Hesperus. . .'',sentences typically communicate (as opposed to semantically encode) existence claims"

379. VIEW: The existence claims communicated by 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorous' depend on the circumstances in which one is told what they refer to.
   EVIDENCE: "what those existence-claims are is a function, not only of what these terms refer to, but also of what the circumstances are in which one is told what they refer to"

380. VIEW: It is epistemically and metaphysically possible that both (66) and (67) could be true.
   EVIDENCE: "Obviously it is epistemically-and also, for that matter, metaphysically-possible that (66) and (67) should both be true."

381. VIEW: The propositions (66) and (67) are compatible with each other and with their negations.
   EVIDENCE: "(66) and (67) are compatible with each other. (Moreover, each is compatible with the negation of the other.)"

382. VIEW: The proposition (70) is false given certain background assumptions.
   EVIDENCE: "Given these assumptions, it follows that (70), taken as a whole, is false."

383. VIEW: The underlined part of (70) is true.
   EVIDENCE: "What's important here is that the underlined part of (70) is true."

384. VIEW: There is no longer any proposition that is both necessary and epistemically contingent (or a posteriori).
   EVIDENCE: "But-and this is equally important-notice that there is no longer any proposition that is both necessary and epistemically contingent (or a posteriori)."

385. VIEW: The underlined part of (69) is possible in both the epistemic and the metaphysical senses.
   EVIDENCE: "The underlined part of (69) is possible in both the epistemic and the metaphysical senses."

386. VIEW: There is nothing metaphysically impossible about a world where something x is uniquely a celestial body to appear in the evening sky, and where something y, distinct from x, is a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and where x is lovely and y is not.
   EVIDENCE: "(Obviously there is nothing metaphysically impossible about a world where something x is uniquely a celestial body to appear in the evening sky, and where something y, distinct from x, is a last celestial body to disappear from the morning sky, and where x is lovely and y is not.)"

387. VIEW: The underlined part of (70), though necessary, is also analytic.
   EVIDENCE: "And the underlined part of (70), though necessary, is also analytic."

388. VIEW: There is some one object z (such that z is identical with Venus) such that the underlined part of (70) is true just in case the proposition z is lovely cannot possibly differ in truth-value from the proposition z is lovely.
   EVIDENCE: "There is some one object z (such that z is identical with Venus) such that the underlined part of (70) is true just in case the proposition z is lovely cannot possibly differ in truth-value from the proposition z is lovely."

389. VIEW: It is analytic, for any object z, that z is lovely has the same truth-value as z is lovely.
   EVIDENCE: "And, of course, it is analytic, for any object z, that z is lovely has the same truth-value as z is lovely."

390. VIEW: There appears to be a distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity only if one fails to distinguish between literal meaning and the information through which it is identified.
   EVIDENCE: "What we are seeing is that, in at least some cases, there appears to be a distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity only if one fails to distinguish between literal meaning, on the one hand, and the information through which it is identified, on the other."

391. VIEW: What is literally meant by 'Hesperus is lovely' coincides with what is literally meant by 'Phosphorous is lovely.'
   EVIDENCE: "For some O, what is literally meant by ''Hesperus is lovely'' coincides with what is literally meant by 'Phosphorous is lovely.'"

392. VIEW: Both sentences 'Hesperus is lovely' and 'Phosphorous is lovely' mean 'O is lovely.'
   EVIDENCE: "For some O, both sentences mean: O is lovely."

393. VIEW: It is analytic that, if 'O is lovely' is true, so is 'O is lovely.'
   EVIDENCE: "But it is obviously analytic that, if O is lovely is true, so is O is lovely."

394. VIEW: The necessity that the proposition meant by 'Hesperus is lovely' is true, given the truth of the proposition meant by 'Phosphorous is lovely', is analytic.
   EVIDENCE: "So while it is indeed necessary that the proposition meant by ''Hesperus is lovely'' is true, given the truth of the proposition meant by ''Phosphorous is lovely'', that necessity is analytic: we aren't dealing with some kind of non-epistemic, a posteriori necessity."

395. VIEW: A person could rationally assent to 'Hesperus is lovely' while not assenting to 'Phosphorous is lovely.'
   EVIDENCE: "At the same time, it is indeed true that a person could rationally assent to ''Hesperus is lovely'' while not assenting to ''Phosphorous is lovely.''"

396. VIEW: The relationship between (66) and (67) is a posteriori.
   EVIDENCE: "The relationship between (66) and (67) is indeed a posteriori: given only that the one is true, it is an open empirical question whether the other is true."

397. VIEW: The relationship between (66) and (67) is contingent.
   EVIDENCE: "But not only is that relationship a posteriori: it is also contingent, as we discussed."

398. VIEW: Given the truth of the proposition meant by 'Hesperus is lovely', it is necessary that the proposition meant by 'Phosphorous is lovely' is also true.
   EVIDENCE: "Given the truth of the proposition meant by ''Hesperus is lovely'', it is necessary that the proposition meant by ''Phosphorous is lovely'' is also true."

399. VIEW: The necessity that the proposition meant by 'Phosphorous is lovely' is true, given the truth of the proposition meant by 'Hesperus is lovely', is analytic.
   EVIDENCE: "But that necessity is analytic, the reason being that both sentences encode the same proposition."

400. VIEW: Given only an acceptance of 'Hesperus is lovely', a person may need additional empirical information to determine whether 'Phosphorous is lovely' is true.
   EVIDENCE: "At the same time, given only an acceptance of ''Hesperus is lovely'', a person may need additional empirical information to determine whether ''Phosphorous is lovely'' is true."

401. VIEW: Given that the proposition through which one identifies the literal meaning of 'Hesperus is lovely' is true, it is not analytic that the proposition through which one identifies the literal meaning of 'Phosphorous is lovely' is also true.
   EVIDENCE: "The reason is that, given that the proposition through which one identifies the literal meaning of the one is true, it is not analytic (or otherwise epistemically necessary) that the proposition through which one identifies the literal meaning of the other is also true."

402. VIEW: Given the truth of one proposition, it is metaphysically possible that the other is false.
   EVIDENCE: "But not only is not analytic: it is not necessary at all. Given the truth of the one proposition, it is metaphysically (and not just epistemically) possible that the other is false."

   EVIDENCE: "we mustn't be led astray by the fact that the expressions anking the identity-sign in (72) are different"

412. VIEW: The information to the left of the underlined part of (72) should not be telescoped into the proposition corresponding to the underlined part.
   EVIDENCE: "And we mustn't be led astray by the information to the left of the underlined part-we mustn't telescope that information into the proposition corresponding to the underlined part"

413. VIEW: There is some one object z such that the proposition P is true just in case z=z.
   EVIDENCE: "There is some one object z such that P is true just in case z=z"

414. VIEW: The proposition z=z is metaphysically necessary.
   EVIDENCE: "for any object z, the proposition z=z is metaphysically necessary"

415. VIEW: The proposition z=z is also analytic and epistemically necessary.
   EVIDENCE: "but it is also analytic and therefore epistemically necessary"

416. VIEW: The literal meaning of (71) is the necessary proposition x=x.
   EVIDENCE: "There is some object x such that the literal meaning of (71) is the necessary-but also the analytic and, indeed, trivial- proposition x=x"

417. VIEW: When we say that (71) is a posteriori, we are not talking about the proposition semantically encoded in that sentence.
   EVIDENCE: "When we say that (71) is a posteriori (i.e. epistemically contingent), we are talking, not about the J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2314-23462338 proposition semantically encoded in that sentence"

418. VIEW: The proposition that is necessary is distinct from the proposition that is epistemically contingent.
   EVIDENCE: "So the proposition that is necessary is quite distinct from the proposition that is epistemically contingent"

419. VIEW: Saying that (71) is both necessary and a posteriori is a failure to distinguish literal meaning from the information through which it is identified.
   EVIDENCE: "And in saying that (71) is both necessary and a posteriori, one is guilty of failing to distinguish literal meaning from the information through which it is identi ed"

420. VIEW: Intersubstituting co-referring terms can lead from true sentences to false ones and vice versa.

423. VIEW: The proposition 'Argo is an economist' is true exactly if O is an economist.
   EVIDENCE: "''Argo is an economist'' encodes a proposition P that is true exactly if: O is an economist."

424. VIEW: For 'Argo is an economist' to be true, it is necessary and sufficient that O be an economist.
   EVIDENCE: "for ''Argo is an economist'' to be true, it is necessary and sufficient that O be an economist"

442. VIEW: The observers know nothing about Ogra.
   EVIDENCE: "We know nothing about him."

443. VIEW: The observers' knowledge of Ogra's appearance is as vague as their knowledge of Argo's appearance.
   EVIDENCE: "And, being as far from us as Argo was, our knowledge of his appearance is as vague as our knowledge of Argo's appearance."

444. VIEW: The only non-generic fact about Ogra that the observers can perceive is that he is wearing drab, tight-fitting clothes.
   EVIDENCE: "There is only one non-generic fact about this person of which our blurry perceptions do apprise us: he is wearing drab, tight-fitting clothes."

445. VIEW: The observers decide to refer to the new person as 'Ogra'.
   EVIDENCE: "Wishing to speak about this person, but not knowing his name, we decide to refer to him ''Ogra.''"

   EVIDENCE: "There is somebody x such that we've been in the habit of watching x skillfully perform dif cult acrobatics and such that x's voice has a healthy resonance; moreover, x is an investment banker."

449. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by the utterance 'Ogra is an investment banker' is that O* is an investment banker.
   EVIDENCE: "the proposition literally meant by that utterance would be: J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2314-23462340 (82) O* is an investment banker"

450. VIEW: The proposition conveyed by the utterance 'Ogra is an investment banker' is similar to the proposition conveyed by the utterance about Argo.

451. VIEW: Argo goes into a phone booth and spends around five minutes there during each Argo-watch.
   EVIDENCE: "During each of our now habitual Argo-watches, we notice that Argo goes into the phone booth and spends around ve minutes in there."

452. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by the utterance 'Argo went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and Argo exited it around ten seconds ago' is that O went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and O exited it around ten seconds ago.
   EVIDENCE: "the (true) proposition P literally meant by an utterance of: (83) ''Argo went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago, and Argo exited it around ten seconds ago'' is equivalent (if not identical) with: (84) O went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago, and O exited it around ten seconds ago."

453. VIEW: The message conveyed by the utterance 'Argo went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and Argo exited it around ten seconds ago' is that somebody x, who performs difficult acrobatics and has a healthy voice resonance, went into the phone booth and exited it.
   EVIDENCE: "the message (or, in any case, part of the message) that would thereby be conveyed, and that (so we may plausibly suppose) it would my intention to convey, would be along the lines of: (85) There is somebody x such that we've been in the habit of watching x skillfully perform dif cult acrobatics and such that x's voice has a healthy resonance; moreover, x went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago, and he exited it around ten seconds ago."

454. VIEW: The message conveyed by the utterance 'Ogra went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and Ogra exited it around ten seconds ago' is that somebody y, who tries to perform rudimentary acrobatics and has an unhealthy voice resonance, went into the phone booth and exited it.
   EVIDENCE: "(a part of) what was thereby conveyed to you would be along the lines of: (87) There is somebody y such that we've been in the habit of watching y oa shly try to perform rudimentary acrobatics and such that y's voice has a unhealthy, plaintiff resonance; moreover, y went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago, and he exited it around ten seconds ago."

455. VIEW: The propositions conveyed by the utterances about Argo and Ogra entering and exiting the phone booth are distinct and do not entail each other.
   EVIDENCE: "(85) and (87) are distinct propositions, and neither entails the other."

456. VIEW: The proposition literally meant by the utterance 'Argo went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and Ogra exited it around ten seconds ago' is that O went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and O* exited it around ten seconds ago.
   EVIDENCE: "the proposition literally meant by an utterance of (88) is: (89) O went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago, and O* exited it around ten seconds ago."

457. VIEW: The proposition communicated by the utterance 'Argo went into that phone booth around five minutes ago, and Ogra exited it around ten seconds ago' involves two different individuals, x and y, with different acrobatic skills and voice resonances, entering and exiting the phone booth.
   EVIDENCE: "the proposition thereby communicated would be along the lines of: (90) There is somebody x such that we've been in the habit of watching x skillfully perform dif cult acrobatics and such that x's voice has a healthy resonance; moreover, x went into that phone booth around ve minutes ago; and there is somebody y such that we've been in the habit of watching y oa shly try to perform rudimentary acrobatics and such that y's voice has a unhealthy, plaintiff resonance; moreover, y exited that phone booth around ten seconds ago."

458. VIEW: The propositions about Argo and Ogra entering and exiting the phone booth do not entail each other.

459. VIEW: Both Argo and Ogra have claimed to be investment bankers.
   EVIDENCE: "Each of Argo and Ogra has claimed to be an investment banker."

460. VIEW: The similarities between Argo and Ogra end with their claim of being investment bankers.
   EVIDENCE: "But that, in our opinion, is where the similarities between them end."

461. VIEW: Argo and Ogra have never appeared at the same time.
   EVIDENCE: "True-they've never both appeared at the same time."

462. VIEW: The fact that Argo and Ogra have never appeared at the same time provides little or no weight for the hypothesis that Argo is Ogra.
   EVIDENCE: "But, given the remaining data, that fact provides little or no weight for the hypothesis that Argo is Ogra."

463. VIEW: Argo's voice matches what is expected of him.
   EVIDENCE: "His voice is exactly what we'd expect it to be."

464. VIEW: Argo's voice, when saying 'I'm sure you have many questions about me,' is clearly Ogra's voice.
   EVIDENCE: "But, in uttering this sentence, his voice is clearly Ogra's."

465. VIEW: What is heard is not merely an impersonation of Ogra's voice but is Ogra's voice itself.
   EVIDENCE: "What we are hearing isn't merely a good impersonation of Ogra's voice: it is Ogra's voice."

466. VIEW: Argo and the observer are voice-experts capable of distinguishing excellent impersonations from the actual voice.
   EVIDENCE: "(Let's suppose that, for some reason, you and I are voice-experts who can distinguish excellent J.-M. Kuczynski / Journal of Pragmatics 42 (2010) 2314-23462341 impersonations of any given voice from that voice itself.)"

   EVIDENCE: "(79) and (82) are, it turns out, one and the same proposition"

477. VIEW: The proposition conveyed by an utterance of (78) could be very different from the proposition conveyed by an utterance of (81).

481. VIEW: Frege believes that (94) and (95) may differ in truth-value.
   EVIDENCE: "According to Frege, (94) ''Smith thinks that Clark Kent went into a phone booth and that Clark Kent came out'' may differ in truth-value from (95) ''Smith thinks that Clark Kent went into a phone booth and that Superman came out''"

482. VIEW: Frege's way of dealing with substitution-failure is to say that the occurrences of names refer to the sense they ordinarily bear.
   EVIDENCE: "Frege's way of dealing with this substitution-failure is to say that, in (94), the occurrences of ''Clark Kent'' refer to the sense that ''Clark Kent'' ordinarily (i.e. in substitution-tolerant contexts) bears"

   EVIDENCE: "They grant that (76) and (77) seem to differ in truth-value."

491. VIEW: Salmon and Soames argue that pragmatics is obscuring semantics, causing the apparent difference in truth-value between (76) and (77).

492. VIEW: Saul does not embrace the solution proposed by Salmon and Soames.
   EVIDENCE: "Why doesn't Saul embrace this solution?"

493. VIEW: Saul believes that the solution presented by Salmon and Soames leaves too many crucial questions unanswered.

   EVIDENCE: "that T and T* (non- semantically) impart propositions P and P*"

510. VIEW: The principle at work in conveying propositions through tokens is questioned.
   EVIDENCE: "why do those tokens convey those propositions? What is the principle at work?"

511. VIEW: A sentence-token with the form '...Clark Kent...' conveys a specific proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "given a sentence-token having either the form ''. . .Clark Kent. . .'' or the form ''. . .Superman. . .'', what is the proposition that, in virtue of having that form, that token conveys?"

522. VIEW: The message borne by (76) is not part of what (77) literally means.
   EVIDENCE: "Since it can be cancelled, it is no part of what (77) literally means."

523. VIEW: Saul's insight corroborates the contention that proper names are directly referential.
   EVIDENCE: "This insight of Saul's provides additional corroboration for our contention that, once the phenomenon of presemantic implicature is taken into account, the relevant linguistic intuitions are consistent with the view that (76)'s literal meaning coincides with (77)'s literal meaning and, more generally, with the contention that proper names are directly referential."

524. VIEW: Boguslawski holds that intersubstituting co-referring expressions preserves truth-value.
   EVIDENCE: "Boguslawski (1994) holds that intersubstituting co-referring expressions preserves truth-value."

525. VIEW: Boguslawski's argument for the contention is similar to the author's argument.

528. VIEW: Smith knows that the guy wearing a blue shirt is a talented pianist.
   EVIDENCE: "Smith knows that the guy wearing a blue shirt is a talented pianist."

529. VIEW: The statement (102) seems to be correct under the circumstances.
   EVIDENCE: "Under the circumstances, (102) seems to be correct."

530. VIEW: Smith may have no idea that Jones is now wearing a blue shirt.
   EVIDENCE: "At the same time, Smith may have absolutely no idea that Jones is now wearing a blue shirt."

531. VIEW: There is a person x (Jones) who meets three specific conditions.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, there is some person x (namely Jones) such that the following three conditions are met:"

532. VIEW: The truth of (102) depends on whether Smith knows that x is a talented pianist.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, the truth of (102) seems to depend only on whether, for the relevant value of x, Jones knows that x is a talented pianist, it being irrelevant what kind of descriptive information is used to refer to x."

533. VIEW: The variation of the story supports extensionality.
   EVIDENCE: "The following variation of the story just told provides yet further support for extensionality."

534. VIEW: Smith knows that the guy who just kicked a soccer ball is a talented pianist.
   EVIDENCE: "(103) Smith knows that the guy who just kicked a soccer ball is a talented pianist."

535. VIEW: The statement (103) seems to be correct under the circumstances.
   EVIDENCE: "Under the circumstances, (103) seems to be correct."

536. VIEW: It is irrelevant whether Smith knows that Jones has just kicked a soccer ball.
   EVIDENCE: "It seems irrelevant whether Smith knows that Jones has just kicked a soccer ball."

537. VIEW: All that matters is that Smith knows that x is a talented pianist.
   EVIDENCE: "All that matters is that, for the relevant value of x, Smith knows that x is a talented pianist."

538. VIEW: The truth of (100) follows from the truth of (98) and (99).
   EVIDENCE: "The story just told can easily be developed so as to show that, given the truth of (98) and (99), the truth of (100) follows."

539. VIEW: Under certain circumstances, the token of (100) has the same truth-value as (99).
   EVIDENCE: "Under these circumstances, if, addressing Green, I utter (100), the resulting token of (100) does very much seem to have the same truth-value as (99)."

540. VIEW: There is an object O identical with Jones such that (99) and (100) affirm the singular proposition (104).
   EVIDENCE: "A closely related point is that, under these circumstances, there is some object O such that O is identical with Jones, and such that each of (99) and (100) affirms the singular proposition: (104) Smith knows that O is a talented pianist."

541. VIEW: On some occasions, (99) and (100) communicate propositions that differ in truth-value.
   EVIDENCE: "There is no denying that, on at least some occasions, (99) and (100) communicate propositions that differ in truth-value."

542. VIEW: The difference in truth-value between (99) and (100) can be explained without assuming a difference in literal meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "But this is easily explained without supposing that what is literally meant by a token of the one differs from what is literally meant by a token of the other."

543. VIEW: A consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is (DDI).
   EVIDENCE: "For reasons that we've already discussed at length, a consequence of the direct-referentialist's position is that: (DDI) In virtue of having the form, ''. . .the phi. . .'', a sentence S will implicate the proposition: exactly one thing x has phi and. . .x. . ."

544. VIEW: (99) could implicate either (99NS) or (99WS).
   EVIDENCE: "Given (DDI), there are two possibilities as to what (99) will implicate. It could implicate either: (99NS) Smith knows that exactly one thing x is his neighbor and, moreover, that x is a talented pianist, or (99WS) exactly one thing x is Smith's neighbor; moreover, Smith knows that x is a talented pianist."

545. VIEW: The implicature can be given either wide-scope or narrow-scope.
   EVIDENCE: "The implicature can be given either wide-scope or narrow-scope; and what degree of scope it is given is to be understood in terms of standard principles of pragmatics, as a bit of fiction shows."

546. VIEW: Brown and Jones know that for some x, x is Smith's neighbor and is also a talented pianist.
   EVIDENCE: "Both Brown and Jones know that, for some x, x is Smith's neighbor and is also a talented pianist, and each knows the other to know this."

547. VIEW: Brown's utterance (105) contains occurrences of (99) and (100).
   EVIDENCE: "Brown says to Jones: (105) ''Smith knows that his neighbor is a talented pianist; and Smith knows that the tallest American spy is a talented pianist.'' Notice that (105) contains an occurrence of (99) and also of (100)."
