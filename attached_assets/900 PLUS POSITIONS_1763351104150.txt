====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: LOGIC
====================================================================================================

**Position LOGIC-CP001: Material Conditional Does Not Capture "If-Then" Meaning**
- The symbol "→" in classical logic (material conditional) does not mean "if...then" in natural language. It merely means "not both P and not-Q" and is strictly truth-conditional, lacking the modal/entailment force of natural language conditionals.

**Position LOGIC-CP002: Natural Language Conditionals Are Modal**
- "If P, then Q" in natural language means "Q follows from P" or "not-Q is incompatible with P" - a modal notion involving possibility and impossibility, not reducible to truth-functional logic.

**Position LOGIC-CP003: The Paradoxes of Material Implication Are Not Genuine Paradoxes**
- The so-called "paradoxes of validity" (e.g., that a false statement entails anything) are not real paradoxes but arise from misconstruing "P→Q" as meaning "if P, then Q" when it actually only means "not (P and not-Q)".

**Position LOGIC-CP004: Relevance Logic Misguided in Approach**
- Attempts by relevance logicians (Belnap, Anderson) to create truth-conditional approximations of natural language "if...then" are misconceived, as they try to model a fundamentally modal notion using truth-conditional methods.

**Position LOGIC-CP005: Classical Logic Implicitly Requires Non-Truth-Conditional Conditionals**
- Classical logic is implicitly committed to a non-truth-conditional conception of conditionality, as the Law of Non-contradiction depends on the modal notion that no statement can be compatible with its own negation.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: ETHICS
====================================================================================================

**Position ETHICS-CP001: Utilitarianism Is Self-Defeating**
- Utilitarianism undermines itself because it presupposes moral bonds and commitments (like those that make Erskin's family deserving of money) while simultaneously permitting violation of those same kinds of bonds when they conflict with utility maximization.

**Position ETHICS-CP002: Kantian Ethics Implicit in the Concept of Desert**
- The concept of what people "deserve" inherently presupposes a Kantian ethical framework where people are ends-in-themselves and not mere means. Without this, the concept of desert loses meaning.

**Position ETHICS-CP003: Promise-Keeping Cannot Be Overridden by Utility Calculations**
- If it is morally permissible to break one promise for the sake of greater utility, then the moral bonds that create all obligations (including those that make certain people "deserve" help) are undermined. The permission to violate commitments destroys the ground of all moral desert.

**Position ETHICS-CP004: Marriage and Parenthood as Moral Commitments**
- Marriage and parenthood constitute special moral commitments that create obligations not owed to others. These commitments are of the same kind as promises and cannot be selectively enforced without contradiction.

**Position ETHICS-CP005: The Greatest Good Presupposes Anti-Utilitarian Ethics**
- The utilitarian goal of "the greatest good for the greatest number" presupposes a world where people can trust each other, exercise autonomy, and not be defrauded - but this presupposes exactly the kind of non-consequentialist ethics that utilitarianism rejects.

**Position ETHICS-CP006: Moral Worth of Persons Is Precondition for Any "Greater Good"**
- There cannot coherently be a "greater good" in a world where people lack inherent moral worth and can be treated as mere means. The concept of a greater good depends on people having the kind of value that prohibits treating them merely as means.

**Position ETHICS-CP007: Consequentialism Generally Is Self-Undermining**
- All forms of consequentialism face the same problem as utilitarianism: they permit actions that undermine the very conditions (trust, autonomy, respect for persons) that make their goals valuable.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: EPISTEMOLOGY
====================================================================================================

**Position EP-CP001: Sensory Perception Is Reliable**
- We can trust our senses as sources of knowledge. Skeptical arguments against sensory perception fail.

**Position EP-CP002: Cartesian Skepticism About Senses Can Be Refuted**
- Descartes' skeptical arguments about sensory perception and the evil demon hypothesis can be successfully refuted.

**Position EP-CP003: We Have Certain Knowledge**
- Despite skeptical challenges, there are things we can know with certainty.

**Position EP-CP004: The Problem of Induction Has a Solution**
- Hume's problem of induction can be resolved. (Note: Kuczynski's broader work argues for a rationalist a priori solution)

**Position EP-CP005: Gettier Cases Show Justification Requires Non-Accidental Connection to Truth**
- Gettier's examples demonstrate that justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge. Knowledge requires that the connection between justification and truth not be accidental.

**Position EP-CP006: Testimony Requires Independent Verification for Knowledge**
- For testimony-based belief to constitute knowledge, one must have independent evidence of the testifier's reliability. Testimony alone is insufficient.

**Position EP-CP007: We Have Access to Absolute Truth**
- There exists such a thing as absolute truth, and we can know it. Relativism about truth is false.

**Position EP-CP008: Uncertainty Has Philosophical Value**
- Recognition of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge has important philosophical value (despite our ability to know some things absolutely).

**Position EP-CP009: Bostrom's Simulation Argument Deserves Serious Consideration**
- Nick Bostrom's argument that we may be living in a computer simulation raises genuine epistemological questions worthy of philosophical analysis.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF MIND
====================================================================================================

**Position MIND-CP001: Mind-Body Dualism Has Strong Arguments**
- There are compelling arguments for substance dualism - the view that mind and body are fundamentally different kinds of substances.

**Position MIND-CP002: Materialism Faces the Hard Problem of Consciousness**
- Materialist accounts of mind face severe difficulties explaining subjective conscious experience (the "hard problem").

**Position MIND-CP003: Nagel's Argument Against Materialism Is Sound**
- Thomas Nagel's famous argument (from "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?") successfully refutes materialist theories of mind.

**Position MIND-CP004: Subjective Experience Cannot Be Reduced to Physical Facts**
- The qualitative, subjective nature of conscious experience (qualia) cannot be fully captured or explained by physical/functional descriptions.

**Position MIND-CP005: The Explanatory Gap Is Real**
- There is a genuine explanatory gap between physical/functional descriptions of brain states and phenomenal consciousness that materialist theories cannot bridge.

**Position MIND-CP006: Dennett's Eliminativism About Consciousness Is False**
- Daniel Dennett's attempt to eliminate or explain away phenomenal consciousness fails. Consciousness is real and cannot be explained in purely functional/behavioral terms.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
====================================================================================================

**Position LANG-CP001: Wittgenstein on Language and Thought Contains Important Insights**
- Wittgenstein's views on the relationship between language and thought raise important philosophical questions about meaning and understanding.

**Position LANG-CP002: Referential-Attributive Distinction Is Not Russellian**
- The distinction between referential and attributive uses of descriptions requires a non-Russellian treatment. Russell's theory of descriptions cannot adequately capture this distinction.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
====================================================================================================

**Position SCI-CP001: The Hypothetico-Deductive Method Has Serious Problems**
- The hypothetico-deductive method of scientific confirmation faces significant philosophical difficulties that undermine its status as the primary method of scientific reasoning.

**Position SCI-CP002: Values Play an Essential Role in Science**
- Value judgments are not eliminable from scientific practice. Science necessarily involves value assumptions that go beyond purely empirical matters.

**Position SCI-CP003: Modern Science Has Distinctive Epistemic Features**
- Modern scientific method differs fundamentally from pre-modern approaches to knowledge in ways that have important philosophical implications.

**Position SCI-CP004: Early Modern Scientific Thought Represents Philosophical Breakthrough**
- The scientific revolution of the early modern period (Galileo, Newton, etc.) represents a fundamental shift in philosophical thinking about nature and knowledge.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: METAPHYSICS
====================================================================================================

**Position META-CP001: Moore's Proof of an External World Fails**
- G.E. Moore's famous proof of an external world (by holding up his hands) is unsuccessful and does not refute skepticism about the external world.

**Position META-CP002: There Is an External World**
- Despite problems with Moore's proof, we can establish that an external world exists.

**Position META-CP003: Descartes' Conception of Self Is Defensible**
- Descartes' view of what he is (a thinking thing) can be defended, though aspects require modification.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
====================================================================================================

**Position REL-CP001: Standard Arguments for God's Existence Fail**
- The traditional arguments for God's existence (cosmological, teleological, ontological) are unsuccessful.

**Position REL-CP002: There Are Genuine Paradoxes Relating to God**
- The concept of God as traditionally understood generates genuine paradoxes (e.g., omnipotence paradox, problem of evil) that create serious philosophical difficulties.

**Position REL-CP003: God Is Not Necessary for Morality**
- Morality does not depend on God's existence. Ethical truths and obligations exist independently of whether God exists.

**Position REL-CP004: God's Foreknowledge Conflicts with Moral Responsibility**
- If God has complete foreknowledge of all future events, human beings cannot be genuinely morally responsible for their actions. Divine foreknowledge and human free will are incompatible.

**Position REL-CP005: Agnosticism Is More Defensible Than Theism**
- Given the arguments for and against God's existence, agnosticism is a more philosophically defensible position than belief in God.

**Position REL-CP006: Religious Institutions Face a Fundamental Paradox**
- Religious institutions face an inherent paradox in attempting to systematize and institutionalize what is supposed to be a matter of personal faith and individual spiritual experience.

**Position REL-CP007: Clifford Right About Epistemic Duty, William James Wrong**
- W.K. Clifford's view that it is wrong to believe anything on insufficient evidence is correct, while William James' defense of the "will to believe" in religious matters is misguided.

**Position REL-CP008: Dawkins' Critique of Religion Has Merit But Also Problems**
- Richard Dawkins' arguments against religion contain valuable criticisms but also exhibit philosophical weaknesses.

**Position REL-CP009: Wollstonecraft and Marx Correct About Religion's Social Function**
- Mary Wollstonecraft and Karl Marx were right that religion serves problematic social functions, though their views differ in details.

**Position REL-CP010: Galileo Was Right to Challenge Religious Authority on Scientific Matters**
- Galileo was justified in asserting the autonomy of scientific investigation against religious authority.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (continued)
====================================================================================================

**Position MIND-CP007: Searle's Chinese Room Refutes Strong AI**
- John Searle's Chinese Room argument successfully demonstrates that mere computation/symbol manipulation is insufficient for genuine understanding and consciousness.

**Position MIND-CP008: Turing Test Is Not a Good Test of Intelligence**
- The Turing Test (Imitation Game) is not an adequate test for genuine intelligence or consciousness. Behavioral indistinguishability from humans does not establish presence of mind.

**Position MIND-CP009: Free Will Is Compatible with Determinism**
- Free will and determinism are compatible (compatibilism). We can act freely even if our actions are determined by prior causes.

**Position MIND-CP010: Hume, Frankfurt, and Holbach on Freedom Raise Important Issues**
- The views of Hume, Harry Frankfurt, and Baron d'Holbach on personal freedom and responsibility raise important questions about the nature of human agency.

**Position MIND-CP011: Neuroscience Does Not Eliminate Free Will**
- Recent neuroscientific findings (e.g., Libet experiments) do not actually disprove the existence of free will.

**Position MIND-CP012: Operant Conditioning Does Not Disprove Free Will**
- The existence of operant conditioning and behavioral modification does not establish that we lack free will.

**Position MIND-CP013: Consciousness and Free Will Are Compatible**
- There is no conflict between the phenomenology of consciousness and the existence of free will.

**Position MIND-CP014: We Have Access to Our Own Mental States Through Introspection**
- We have privileged first-person access to our own mental states through introspection. This access is direct and generally reliable.

**Position MIND-CP015: Apes Lack Key Cognitive Capacities Humans Possess**
- Despite significant cognitive abilities in great apes, humans possess distinctive cognitive capacities (likely related to language and abstract thought) that apes lack.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
====================================================================================================

**Position POL-CP001: Mill's Harm Principle Defensible**
- John Stuart Mill's harm principle (that liberty should only be restricted to prevent harm to others) is fundamentally sound.

**Position POL-CP002: Liberty Has Intrinsic Value**
- Personal freedom and liberty have inherent value, not merely instrumental value for producing other goods.

**Position POL-CP003: Hobbes, Marx, Rousseau, Nietzsche Each Identify Central Problems**
- Hobbes' analysis of the state of nature, Marx's critique of capitalism, Rousseau's social contract theory, and Nietzsche's critique of conventional morality each identify important truths about politics and society.

**Position POL-CP004: Free Markets Have Both Virtues and Vices**
- Free market systems produce important benefits (efficiency, innovation, wealth creation) but also generate serious problems (inequality, exploitation, market failures).

**Position POL-CP005: Legal Freedom and Substantive Freedom Can Conflict**
- There is a tension between legal/formal freedom (absence of coercion) and substantive freedom (actual ability to pursue one's goals). The free market can maximize the former while limiting the latter.

**Position POL-CP006: Mill and von Hayek Make Important Contributions to Economic Philosophy**
- Both Mill's and Friedrich von Hayek's analyses of free market economics contain valuable insights, despite their different emphases.

**Position POL-CP007: Founding Fathers Had Complex Views on Democracy**
- The American founding fathers both supported and opposed democratic elements. The Constitution was neither simply democratic nor simply anti-democratic but mixed.

**Position POL-CP008: Plato's Republic Prefigures Totalitarianism**
- Plato's ideal state in the Republic shares disturbing features with modern totalitarian regimes (echoing Karl Popper's famous critique).

**Position POL-CP009: Freedom of Speech Has Limits**
- While freedom of speech is valuable and important, it is not absolute. There are legitimate limits to free expression.

**Position POL-CP010: Freedom of Speech Deserves Strong Defense**
- Despite legitimate limits, freedom of speech requires robust defense against attempts to restrict it for bad reasons.

**Position POL-CP011: Prejudice Functions as Psychological Resistance**
- Prejudice and bigotry serve psychological functions (such as maintaining self-esteem, creating in-group solidarity, projecting unacceptable impulses onto out-groups).

**Position POL-CP012: Freudian Analysis Illuminates Prejudice**
- Psychoanalytic concepts (sublimation, projection, displacement) help explain the psychological roots of prejudice and discrimination.

**Position POL-CP013: College Admissions Should Consider Standardized Tests**
- Standardized tests should continue to play a role in college admissions despite their limitations, as they provide valuable information about academic preparation.

**Position POL-CP014: Wealth Redistribution Can Be Legitimate**
- Under certain conditions, government redistribution of wealth is morally justified.

**Position POL-CP015: Drug Legalization Has Economic Justification**
- There are strong economic arguments for legalizing currently prohibited drugs.

**Position POL-CP016: Environmental Regulation Preferable to Carbon Taxes**
- Direct environmental regulations are superior to carbon tax schemes for addressing environmental problems.

**Position POL-CP017: Minimum Wage Laws Are Economically Harmful**
- Minimum wage laws, despite good intentions, produce negative economic consequences that harm those they intend to help.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
====================================================================================================

**Position HIST-CP001: American Entry into WWI Had Economic Justification**
- The United States' entry into World War I can be justified on economic grounds.

**Position HIST-CP002: US Was a World Leader 1946-1991**
- The United States functioned as a genuine world leader during the Cold War period, despite problematic aspects of its foreign policy.

**Position HIST-CP003: Colonialism Differs from Imperialism**
- Colonialism and imperialism, while related, are distinct phenomena that need to be analyzed separately.

**Position HIST-CP004: Soviet Union Collapse Had Multiple Causes**
- The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted from a combination of economic, political, and social factors rather than any single cause.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: ETHICS OF PRACTICAL ISSUES

**Position APP-CP001: Late-Term Abortions Raise Serious Ethical Issues**
- Late-term abortions present more difficult ethical questions than early-term abortions, requiring careful philosophical analysis.

**Position APP-CP002: Suicide Raises Complex Philosophical Questions**
- Schopenhauer's analysis of suicide and related philosophical discussions show that the ethics of suicide is more complex than commonly assumed.

**Position APP-CP003: Corporate Executives Should Be Held Criminally Liable for Workplace Deaths**
- When corporate negligence leads to deaths or injuries in the workplace, executives should face criminal rather than merely civil penalties.

**Position APP-CP004: Euthanasia and Medical Ethics Require Careful Analysis**
- End-of-life medical decisions, including euthanasia, raise complex ethical issues that demand rigorous philosophical examination.

**Position APP-CP005: Business Ethics Faces "Endgame" Scenarios**
- Business people regularly face ethical dilemmas where maintaining ethical principles seems to conflict with competitive success, requiring philosophical analysis of whether ethics and business success are compatible.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY
====================================================================================================

**Position CONT-CP001: Camus and Schopenhauer Share Views on Meaning of Life**
- Albert Camus and Arthur Schopenhauer reach similar conclusions about the meaninglessness or absurdity of life, despite different philosophical frameworks.

- Camus' absurdism and Thomas Nagel's analysis of life's meaning share important insights about the human condition.

**Position CONT-CP003: Camus' Hero Is Rebel Without Traditional Cause**
- Camus' vision of authentic existence involves rebellion against absurdity without appeal to traditional religious or metaphysical meaning.

**Position CONT-CP004: Schopenhauer on Human Suffering Remains Relevant**
- Schopenhauer's analysis of human suffering and the will contains insights that remain philosophically important.

**Position CONT-CP005: Schopenhauer's Metaphysics Has Fractal Structure**
- Schopenhauer's conception of reality involves a fractal-like structure where the same patterns repeat at different levels.

**Position CONT-CP006: Nietzsche and Schopenhauer on Meaning Differ Importantly**
- While both Nietzsche and Schopenhauer deny traditional religious meaning, their alternative visions differ significantly.

**Position CONT-CP007: Sartre's Later Work Inferior to Earlier Work**
- Sartre's later Marxist writings are philosophically weaker than his earlier existentialist work.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY
====================================================================================================

**Position ANC-CP001: Socrates' Execution Involved Multiple Factors**
- Socrates was executed not simply for his philosophical views but due to a complex combination of political, social, and philosophical factors.

**Position ANC-CP002: Pre-Socratics Identify Problem of the One and the Many**
- The pre-Socratic philosophers identified a fundamental metaphysical problem about unity and plurality that remains important.

**Position ANC-CP003: Plato's Cave Allegory Addresses Epistemology and Metaphysics**
- Plato's allegory of the cave makes important points about both the nature of knowledge and the structure of reality.

**Position ANC-CP004: Aristotle's Virtue Ethics Has Enduring Value**
- Aristotle's approach to ethics through virtue and character development provides an important alternative to consequentialism and deontology.

**Position ANC-CP005: Aristotle's Conception of Good Life Remains Relevant**
- Aristotle's analysis of eudaimonia (flourishing/the good life) offers insights applicable to contemporary questions about wellbeing.

**Position ANC-CP006: Aristotle on Virtue More Defensible Than Kant**
- Aristotle's virtue-based approach to ethics is philosophically superior to Kant's duty-based approach in important respects.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: MODERN PHILOSOPHY
====================================================================================================

**Position MOD-CP001: Kant's Moral Philosophy Has Significant Strengths**
- Kant's ethical theory, based on the categorical imperative and treating persons as ends, captures important moral truths.

- The virtue theories of Locke, Aristotle, and Kant can be partially integrated despite their differences.

**Position MOD-CP004: Bentham and Mill on Pleasure Differ Importantly**
- Jeremy Bentham's quantitative hedonism and John Stuart Mill's qualitative hedonism represent significantly different approaches to utilitarian ethics.

**Position MOD-CP005: Mill vs. Hobbes on Liberty Reveals Deep Disagreement**
- Mill's defense of liberty and Hobbes' more restricted view of freedom reflect fundamentally different conceptions of human nature and politics.

**Position MOD-CP006: Rousseau, Goldman, and von Hayek Offer Competing Views of Ideal State**
- Different political philosophers (Rousseau's general will, Emma Goldman's anarchism, Hayek's spontaneous order) present competing but each partially valid visions.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: 20TH CENTURY PHILOSOPHY
====================================================================================================

**Position 20TH-CP001: Russell on Value of Philosophy Identifies Important Points**
- Bertrand Russell's account of why philosophy is valuable (expanding conception of possibilities, reducing dogmatism, etc.) captures important truths about philosophical inquiry.

**Position 20TH-CP002: Nagel's Hard Problem Arguments Are Compelling**
- Thomas Nagel's arguments about the hard problem of consciousness and the limits of physical explanation are philosophically powerful.

**Position 20TH-CP003: Skinner and Dennett on Human Condition Face Problems**
- The behaviorist/functionalist accounts of the human condition offered by B.F. Skinner and Daniel Dennett fail to capture essential features of human experience.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: EPISTEMOLOGY (continued)
====================================================================================================

**Position EP-CP010: Sociology of Knowledge Has Philosophical Importance**
- Sociological factors in knowledge production raise important epistemological questions about objectivity and justification.

- We can achieve the kind of certainty Descartes sought, but only for a limited range of propositions.

**Position EP-CP012: There Are Things We Know with Certainty**
- Despite skeptical challenges, there are propositions we can know with absolute certainty (e.g., "I exist," "I am thinking").

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (continued)

**Position EDUC-CP001: Higher Education Has Distinctive Business Model**
- Universities operate according to a distinctive business model that differs fundamentally from ordinary commercial enterprises.

**Position EDUC-CP002: Graduation and Retention Rates May Not Matter Most**
- Contrary to common assumptions, graduation and retention rates may not be the most important metrics for evaluating educational institutions.

**Position EDUC-CP003: Universities Sell Degrees, Not Instruction**
- The fundamental product universities offer is credentials (degrees) rather than education or instruction per se.

**Position EDUC-CP004: Knowledge Management Principles Don't Apply to Traditional Universities**
- Standard knowledge management principles used in business cannot be straightforwardly applied to traditional university structures.

**Position EDUC-CP005: Digitization of Education Often Advisable**
- Many forms of education can and should be digitized when possible for efficiency and accessibility.

**Position EDUC-CP006: Alternative Education Models Should Be Explored**
- Alternative models of higher education (like the hypothetical "DMO" described) deserve serious consideration as improvements over traditional university structures.

**Position EDUC-CP007: Education Should Emphasize Instruction Over Selection**

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: METAETHICS
====================================================================================================

**Position METAETH-CP001: Consequentialism Self-Defeating Generally**
- The critique of utilitarianism extends to all forms of consequentialism: they undermine the conditions that make their goals valuable.

**Position METAETH-CP002: Deontological Constraints Are Rationally Required**
- Deontological constraints (such as prohibitions on treating persons as mere means) are not arbitrary restrictions on utility maximization but rational requirements of coherent moral thinking.

**Position METAETH-CP003: Moral Bonds and Commitments Foundational**
- Relationships involving trust, commitment, and special obligations (friendship, family, promises) are foundational to morality rather than being overrideable by impersonal utility calculations.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: APPLIED ETHICS (continued)
====================================================================================================

**Position APP-CP006: Good Employee Treatment Not Always Profitable**
- While treating employees well can sometimes increase profitability, there are cases where ethical treatment of workers reduces short-term profits, creating genuine ethical dilemmas for businesses.

**Position APP-CP007: Corporate Social Responsibility More Than Profit Maximization**
- Contra Milton Friedman, the social responsibility of business extends beyond mere profit maximization to stakeholders beyond shareholders.

**Position APP-CP008: Money Can Function Like a Drug**
- The pursuit of money can exhibit addiction-like psychological patterns that raise ethical questions about capitalism and human motivation.

**Position APP-CP009: Parable of the Sadhu Reveals Ethical Failures**

**Position SOC-CP002: Feminist Theory Identifies Patriarchal Structures**
- Feminist analysis successfully identifies systematic patterns of male dominance in social structures.

**Position SOC-CP003: Critical Thinking Faces Systematic Traps**
- There are identifiable patterns of fallacious reasoning that systematically impede critical thinking and rational discourse.

====================================================================================================
DOMAIN: POLITICAL ECONOMY
====================================================================================================

**Position ECON-CP001: Free Market Creates Contradictions**
- Free market capitalism generates internal contradictions that create economic instability and social problems.

**Position ECON-CP002: Marxist Economics Has Valid Insights**
- Despite problems with Marxist political programs, Marxist economic analysis identifies real features of capitalism.

**Position ECON-CP003: Commodity Fetishism Is Real Phenomenon**

ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN COLLEGE PAPERS PLUS
====================================================================================================

**Argument ARG-CP001: Against Material Conditional Interpretation of "If-Then"**
1. "If P then Q" in natural language means Q follows from P (modal notion)
2. "P→Q" in formal logic means merely "not (P and not-Q)" (truth-functional)
3. These have different truth conditions (false P makes P→Q true, but doesn't make Q follow from P)
4. Therefore, "P→Q" does not capture the meaning of natural language "if-then"

**Argument ARG-CP002: Self-Defeat Argument Against Utilitarianism**
1. Utilitarianism says we should maximize welfare even if it requires breaking promises
2. People deserve help only because of moral bonds and commitments
3. If promises can be broken for utility, then all moral bonds are violable
4. If all moral bonds are violable, then no one deserves anything
5. Therefore, utilitarianism undermines its own claim that we should help those who deserve help

**Argument ARG-CP003: Kantian Ethics Implicit in Concept of Desert**
1. To say someone "deserves" something presupposes they have moral worth
2. Having moral worth means being an end-in-oneself, not merely a means
3. Being an end-in-oneself means one's interests cannot be sacrificed for utility
4. This is precisely Kant's principle
5. Therefore, the concept of desert presupposes Kantian ethics

**Argument ARG-CP004: Nagel's Bat Argument Against Materialism**
1. Conscious experience has an essentially subjective, first-person character
2. Physical descriptions are inherently third-person and objective
3. No amount of third-person physical description can capture first-person subjective character
4. Therefore, consciousness cannot be reduced to or fully explained by physical facts

**Argument ARG-CP005: Chinese Room Against Strong AI**
1. Understanding requires grasp of meaning, not just symbol manipulation
2. A person following rules for manipulating Chinese symbols without understanding Chinese can produce appropriate outputs
3. Computers are just symbol manipulators following rules
4. Therefore, computation alone is insufficient for genuine understanding
5. Therefore, Strong AI (computation sufficient for mind) is false

**Argument ARG-CP006: Against Adequacy of Turing Test**
1. The Turing Test judges intelligence by behavioral outputs
2. Systems could produce appropriate outputs without genuine understanding (as Chinese Room shows)
3. Behavioral indistinguishability is insufficient for genuine intelligence
4. Therefore, passing the Turing Test doesn't establish genuine intelligence

**Argument ARG-CP007: For Reliability of Senses**
1. Skeptical arguments about senses either prove too much (making all knowledge impossible) or too little (leaving room for justified sensory belief)
2. We have overwhelming practical evidence for sensory reliability
3. Sensory perception is self-correcting through multiple modalities
4. Therefore, we can trust our senses as reliable guides to reality

**Argument ARG-CP008: Against Moore's Proof of External World**
1. Moore claims to prove external world by: "Here is one hand, here is another, therefore external things exist"
2. This begs the question against the skeptic by assuming the very thing in question (that perceptions correspond to reality)
3. The skeptic can grant Moore's experience without granting it represents external reality
4. Therefore, Moore's proof fails to refute skepticism

**Argument ARG-CP009: Divine Foreknowledge Incompatible with Freedom**
1. If God has complete foreknowledge, all future acts are already fixed and certain
2. If an act is already fixed and certain before I perform it, I cannot do otherwise
3. If I cannot do otherwise, I am not free
4. If I am not free, I am not morally responsible
5. Therefore, divine foreknowledge eliminates moral responsibility

**Argument ARG-CP010: God Not Necessary for Morality**
1. Either moral truths depend on God's will or they don't (Divine Command vs. moral realism)
2. If moral truths depend on God's will, morality is arbitrary (could have been different)
3. If moral truths don't depend on God's will, they exist independently of God
4. Either way, God is not the foundation of morality
5. Therefore, morality does not require God's existence

**Argument ARG-CP011: For Compatibilism About Free Will**
1. Free will requires that actions flow from one's own desires and deliberations
2. Determinism says all events have prior causes
3. Actions flowing from one's own desires can be caused by prior events
4. Therefore, free will is compatible with determinism
5. We act freely when we act on our own desires, even if those desires are determined

**Argument ARG-CP012: Standard Arguments for God's Existence Fail**
- Cosmological: Requires assuming everything needs a cause except God (special pleading)
- Teleological: Apparent design could result from natural selection (Darwin's refutation)
- Ontological: Existence is not a predicate (Kant's refutation)
- Therefore, traditional arguments don't establish God's existence

**Argument ARG-CP013: For Intrinsic Value of Liberty**
1. Liberty allows persons to develop and exercise their distinctive capacities
2. Development of distinctive human capacities is intrinsically valuable
3. Liberty is necessary for this development
4. Therefore, liberty has intrinsic value beyond its instrumental benefits

**Argument ARG-CP014: Qualitative Hedonism Superior to Quantitative**
1. Some pleasures are qualitatively higher than others (Mill vs. Bentham)
2. People who have experienced both prefer higher pleasures even if less intense
3. Quantity alone cannot explain this preference
4. Therefore, pleasures differ in quality, not just quantity

**Argument ARG-CP015: Against Eliminativism About Consciousness**
1. Phenomenal consciousness is immediately given in experience
2. No theory could make one doubt what is immediately given
3. Eliminativist theories (like Dennett's) deny or explain away phenomenal consciousness
4. But phenomenal consciousness cannot rationally be denied
5. Therefore, eliminativism is false

**Argument ARG-CP016: Virtue Ethics Captures Important Moral Truths**
1. Morality concerns not just individual acts but character and patterns of behavior
2. Consequentialism and deontology focus only on evaluating individual acts
3. Virtue ethics attends to character and disposition
4. Therefore, virtue ethics captures aspects of morality that other theories miss

**Argument ARG-CP017: Values Essential to Science**
1. Scientists must make decisions about what to study, what counts as evidence, how to weigh competing considerations
2. These decisions cannot be made on purely empirical grounds
3. They require value judgments
4. Therefore, science necessarily involves values beyond pure empirical facts

**Argument ARG-CP018: Universities Sell Credentials Not Education**
1. University revenue comes from degrees granted, not from instruction quality
2. Students primarily seek degrees for employment, not knowledge per se
3. Universities compete on prestige of degree, not instructional excellence
4. Therefore, the real product is the credential, not the education

**Argument ARG-CP019: For Knowledge Management in Business**
1. Organizations lose efficiency when knowledge is siloed or lost
2. Systematic knowledge management prevents this loss
3. Knowledge management improves organizational performance
4. Therefore, businesses should implement knowledge management systems

**Argument ARG-CP020: Against Phenomen alism**
1. Phenomenalism tries to reduce physical objects to patterns of sense experience
2. But sense experiences are fleeting and subjective
3. Physical objects are supposed to be permanent and objective
4. No pattern of fleeting subjective experiences can constitute permanent objective objects
5. Therefore, phenomenalism fails

====================================================================================================
CRITICAL INSIGHTS AND METHODOLOGICAL POINTS
====================================================================================================

**Insight INS-CP001: Logical Formalism Can Mislead About Natural Language**
- The use of formal logical systems to model natural language reasoning can lead to philosophical confusion when truth-functional connectives are mistaken for their natural language counterparts.

**Insight INS-CP002: Moral Theories Can Be Self-Undermining**
- A moral theory can be internally incoherent if it permits actions that destroy the conditions presupposed by its own goals and values.

**Insight INS-CP003: Phenomenology Has Epistemological Priority**
- What is immediately given in experience (like phenomenal consciousness) has a kind of epistemic certainty that cannot be undermined by theoretical considerations.

**Insight INS-CP004: Behaviorism Insufficient for Mind**
- Purely behavioral or functional analyses of mental states cannot capture the intrinsic, qualitative nature of conscious experience.

**Insight INS-CP005: Philosophy Valuable for Non-Practical Reasons**
- Philosophy's value lies not primarily in solving practical problems but in expanding understanding, reducing dogmatism, and exploring conceptual possibilities.

**Insight INS-CP006: Special Relationships Generate Special Obligations**
- Promises, marriages, parenthood, and friendships create special moral obligations that cannot be fully captured by impersonal moral calculations.

**Insight INS-CP007: Legal and Substantive Freedom Can Come Apart**
- The formal absence of coercion (legal freedom) does not guarantee actual ability to pursue one's goals (substantive freedom).

**Insight INS-CP008: Paradoxes Often Result from Conceptual Confusion**
- Many apparent paradoxes (like the "paradoxes of material implication") dissolve when underlying conceptual confusions are clarified.

**Insight INS-CP009: Evolutionary Analysis Illuminates Human Behavior**
- Many human behaviors and psychological patterns can be better understood through evolutionary analysis of adaptive strategies.

**Insight INS-CP010: Psychological Defense Mechanisms Operate Unconsciously**
- Freudian concepts like sublimation, projection, and displacement reveal that much morally-relevant psychology operates below conscious awareness.

====================================================================================================
PHILOSOPHICAL DISTINCTIONS DRAWN
====================================================================================================

**Distinction DIS-CP001: Material Conditional vs. Natural Language Conditional**
- Material conditional (P→Q): truth-functional, "not (P and not-Q)"
- Natural conditional ("if P, then Q"): modal, "Q follows from P" or "Q necessary given P"

**Distinction DIS-CP002: Legal vs. Substantive Freedom**
- Legal freedom: absence of coercion, formal permission
- Substantive freedom: actual ability to pursue one's goals, real opportunity

**Distinction DIS-CP003: Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value**
- Intrinsic value: valuable in itself, for its own sake
- Instrumental value: valuable as means to something else

**Distinction DIS-CP004: Quantitative vs. Qualitative Hedonism**
- Quantitative (Bentham): pleasures differ only in amount
- Qualitative (Mill): pleasures differ in kind/quality, not just amount

**Distinction DIS-CP005: Act vs. Character Evaluation**
- Act evaluation: judging individual actions as right/wrong
- Character evaluation: judging persons/dispositions as virtuous/vicious

**Distinction DIS-CP006: First-Person vs. Third-Person Perspective**
- First-person: subjective, from inside experience
- Third-person: objective, from outside observation

**Distinction DIS-CP007: Colonialism vs. Imperialism**
- Colonialism: establishing settlements/colonies in foreign territories
- Imperialism: extending political/economic control without necessarily settling

**Distinction DIS-CP008: Internal vs. External Motivation**
- Internal (intrinsic): motivated by interest in activity itself
- External (extrinsic): motivated by rewards/punishments external to activity

**Distinction DIS-CP009: Gatekeeper vs. Instructor Model of Education**
- Gatekeeper: institution as selector of talent
- Instructor: institution as provider of learning

**Distinction DIS-CP010: Credentials vs. Education as Product**
- Credentials: degrees/certificates for signaling
- Education: actual knowledge and skill development

NOTES ON EXTRACTION
====================================================================================================

This collection represents Kuczynski's undergraduate and early graduate work, showing the development
of positions that would later be elaborated in his mature philosophical works. Key themes that appear
here and recur throughout his corpus include:

1. Critique of truth-functional logic as capture of natural language reasoning
2. Defense of Kantian ethics against consequentialism
3. Arguments for dualism and against materialism about mind
4. Rationalist approaches to knowledge and induction
5. Analysis of free markets and political economy
6. Integration of psychological insights (especially Freudian) into philosophical analysis

The work shows engagement with both analytic philosophy (logic, philosophy of mind, epistemology)
and practical philosophy (ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of education), presaging the
breadth of Kuczynski's later philosophical system.

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FROM DEEPER EXTRACTION
====================================================================================================

**Position LANG-CP005: Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument Is Flawed**
- Wittgenstein's argument against private language fails because private rules can have enforcement mechanisms through natural consequences (e.g., eating poisonous berries if one misinterprets one's own code), not just social enforcement.

**Position LANG-CP006: Thought Not Inherently Linguistic**
- Thought is not inherently linguistic. There exists visual thought, musical thought, and other non-linguistic forms of thinking. Wittgenstein was wrong to identify thought with language use.

**Position LANG-CP007: Thought Required for Language Understanding**
- Thought is logically prior to language understanding. One must be able to think in order to understand or operate with semantic rules. Therefore, thought cannot be constituted by linguistic rule-following.

**Position LANG-CP008: Wittgenstein's Rule-Following Argument Fails**
- The rule-following argument (that all genuine rules must be social/public) is false because private rules can have real consequences that constitute genuine enforcement without social mechanisms.

**Position ETHICS-CP009: Late-Term Abortions Specifically Are Unethical**
- Late-term (third trimester) abortions are ethically wrong because neurobiological evidence shows late-term fetuses have psychological characteristics similar to newborn infants, making them persons with rights.

**Position ETHICS-CP010: Personhood Depends on Psychological Capacities**
- Whether something is a person (and thus has moral rights) depends on whether it has relevant psychological capacities such as consciousness, pain sensitivity, and other mental features.

**Position ETHICS-CP011: Neurobiological Evidence Relevant to Abortion Ethics**
- Medical/neurobiological evidence about fetal development is directly relevant to and decisive for ethical questions about abortion.

**Position ETHICS-CP012: "Future Like Ours" Argument Has Force**
- Don Berkich's argument that fetuses have "a future like ours" and abortion robs them of this future provides a legitimate basis for opposition to abortion.

**Position META-CP004: Moore's Proof Begs the Question**
- G.E. Moore's attempt to prove an external world by holding up his hands begs the question against the skeptic because the skeptic would not grant the existence of hands as mind-independent objects.

**Position META-CP005: Question-Begging Broader Than Premise-Conclusion Identity**
- An argument begs the question not only when the conclusion is identical to a premise, but when the premises would not be granted by one's opponent or when accepting the premises requires already accepting the conclusion.

**Position META-CP006: Sophisticated Beliefs Are Distillations of Lower-Level Beliefs**
- Beliefs like "there exists an external world" are sophistications or distillations of lower-level beliefs like "there exists a hand here." The fact that children have the latter without the former doesn't show independent plausibility.

**Position META-CP007: Non-Question-Begging Arguments Against Skepticism Possible**
- Unlike Moore's proof, some arguments against skepticism don't beg the question, such as arguing from the existence of mental states plus causation principles to the existence of external causes of those mental states.

**Position MIND-CP016: Nagel's Bat Argument Succeeds Against Materialism**
- Nagel's argument that complete knowledge of bat physiology would not give knowledge of what it's like to be a bat successfully refutes materialist accounts of consciousness.

**Position MIND-CP017: Physiological Knowledge Insufficient for Psychological Knowledge**
- Complete knowledge of an organism's physical/physiological facts does not automatically give knowledge of that organism's phenomenal psychological states (what it's like to be that organism).

**Position MIND-CP018: Intensional Fallacy Response to Nagel Fails**
- The objection that Nagel commits an intensional fallacy (like arguing water isn't H2O because one can know something is water without knowing it's H2O) fails because complete chemical knowledge gives complete knowledge of water, but complete physiological knowledge doesn't give complete knowledge of consciousness.

**Position MIND-CP019: Psychology Not Reducible to Physiology**
- Psychology (what it's like to have certain experiences) cannot be reduced to or identified with physiology, even if they are in some sense correlated.

**Position EP-CP013: Schopenhauer Correct That Life Involves Suffering**
- Schopenhauer's analysis that life fundamentally involves suffering and that pleasure/happiness are unstable while pain is stable is essentially correct.

**Position EP-CP014: Life's Meaning Requires Some Strife**
- "Life without pain has no meaning" - some degree of adversity or challenge is necessary for life to have meaning (Schopenhauer's insight).

**Position EP-CP015: Acceptance of Life's Negativity Enables Its Positive Aspects**
- Both Camus and Schopenhauer agree that accepting what is negative or difficult in life is necessary for gaining what is positive from it.

**Position CONT-CP008: Camus' Absurdism Differs from Schopenhauer's Pessimism**
- While both Camus and Schopenhauer have seemingly negative views of life, they differ fundamentally: Schopenhauer focuses on suffering, Camus on lack of pre-given meaning; and Camus sees lack of meaning as potentially liberating.

**Position CONT-CP009: Search for Pre-Given Meaning Prevents Finding Meaning**
- Searching for what happiness or meaning consists of prevents one from being happy or living meaningfully (insight shared by Camus and Schopenhauer).

**Position CONT-CP010: Lack of Pre-Given Meaning Enables Freedom**
- The fact that life doesn't have a pre-existing meaning is not purely negative; it allows human freedom to create meaning rather than being constrained by predetermined purposes (Camus).

**Position ETHICS-CP013: Professional Ethics Violations Include Breach of Confidentiality**
- Violations of professional confidentiality (like discussing client information with others without consent) constitute serious ethical breaches regardless of motive.

**Position ETHICS-CP014: Professional Relationships Create Ethical Boundaries**
- Romantic relationships between professionals and staff members can create ethical problems when they tempt violations of professional duties like confidentiality.

**Position ETHICS-CP015: Private Conduct Matters When It Affects Professional Duties**
- While private conduct (like marital infidelity) may be morally problematic, it becomes professionally relevant primarily when it leads to breaches of professional responsibilities.

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS
====================================================================================================

**Question Q-CP021: Can private language exist?**
- Can an individual create a genuine language for purely private use, or does language necessarily require a community?

**Question Q-CP022: Is thought prior to language or vice versa?**
- Must one already be able to think in order to use language, or is linguistic capacity constitutive of thought?

**Question Q-CP023: When does a fetus become a person with rights?**
- At what stage of development does a fetus acquire the moral status of personhood?

**Question Q-CP024: What psychological capacities are necessary for personhood?**
- Which mental/psychological characteristics (consciousness, pain sensitivity, etc.) are necessary and/or sufficient for moral personhood?

**Question Q-CP025: How can we refute skepticism without begging the question?**
- Is there a way to argue against skepticism about the external world that doesn't assume what needs to be proved?

**Question Q-CP026: What makes an argument question-begging?**
- Beyond premise-conclusion identity, what makes premises inappropriately dependent on the conclusion?

**Question Q-CP027: Can complete physical knowledge give complete psychological knowledge?**
- If we knew everything physical about a conscious organism, would we thereby know everything about its subjective experience?

**Question Q-CP028: Is materialism about mind refutable in principle?**
- Can philosophical arguments definitively refute the identity or reduction of mental to physical?

**Question Q-CP029: Does life require suffering to have meaning?**
- Is some degree of adversity or difficulty necessary for a meaningful life?

**Question Q-CP030: Does life have pre-given meaning or must we create it?**
- Is there meaning inherent in existence, or must individuals/humanity create meaning?

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS
====================================================================================================

**Argument ARG-CP021: Against Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument**
1. Wittgenstein argues private rules have no enforcement and thus are not genuine rules
2. But private rules can have natural consequences (eating poisonous berries if misinterpreted)
3. These consequences constitute real enforcement
4. Therefore, private rules and private language are possible

**Argument ARG-CP022: Thought Logically Prior to Language**
1. Understanding language requires understanding semantic rules
2. Understanding rules requires thought/cognition
3. Therefore, thought is logically prior to language
4. Therefore, thought cannot be constituted by language use

**Argument ARG-CP023: Against Moore's Proof**
1. The skeptic denies existence of external objects
2. Moore's "proof" assumes the existence of hands as external objects
3. Therefore, Moore's premises require what the skeptic denies (the existence of external objects)
4. Therefore, Moore's argument begs the question

**Argument ARG-CP024: Late-Term Fetuses Are Persons**
1. Persons are beings with relevant psychological capacities (consciousness, pain sensitivity)
2. Late-term fetuses have neurological structures sufficient for these capacities
3. Late-term fetuses are neurologically similar to newborns
4. Newborns are persons
5. Therefore, late-term fetuses are persons with moral rights

**Argument ARG-CP025: Complete Physical Knowledge Insufficient for Consciousness Knowledge**
1. One could know everything physical about a bat (complete physiological knowledge)
2. One still would not know what it's like to be a bat (phenomenal knowledge)
3. If consciousness were purely physical, complete physical knowledge would give complete consciousness knowledge
4. But it doesn't
5. Therefore, consciousness is not purely physical

**Argument ARG-CP026: Intensional Fallacy Objection Fails**
1. The objection: Nagel's argument is like saying water isn't H2O because I can know x is water without knowing x is H2O
2. But: I can know x is water without knowing x is H2O only if I lack complete chemical knowledge
3. However: I can have complete physiological knowledge of a bat and still not know what it's like to be a bat
4. The cases are disanalogous
5. Therefore, the intensional fallacy objection fails

**Argument ARG-CP027: Suffering Central to Life's Nature**
1. Pleasure and happiness are unstable, requiring specific conditions
2. Pain and suffering are stable, resulting from many conditions
3. Therefore, pain is more probable than pleasure
4. Therefore, life is fundamentally more about suffering than pleasure
5. But suffering can give life meaning when properly accepted

**Argument ARG-CP028: Pre-Given Meaning Would Limit Freedom**
1. If life had pre-determined meaning/purpose, we would be constrained to fulfill it
2. Lack of pre-given meaning means we're free to create our own meaning
3. Freedom to create meaning is valuable
4. Therefore, lack of pre-given meaning can be seen as liberating rather than merely negative

====================================================================================================
METHODOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS
====================================================================================================

**Insight INS-CP011: Philosophical Arguments Against Ordinary Language Philosophy**
- Wittgenstein and ordinary language philosophers often over-extend insights about public language to make implausible claims about impossibility of private thought or meaning.

**Insight INS-CP012: Neurobiological Evidence Can Resolve Ethical Debates**
- Empirical findings about fetal neurology can and should inform ethical debates about abortion by establishing facts about psychological capacities.

**Insight INS-CP013: Question-Begging Is Contextual**
- Whether an argument begs the question depends on the dialectical context and what one's opponent would grant, not just formal logical structure.

**Insight INS-CP014: Sophistication vs. Independent Plausibility**
- That a belief B₁ is a "sophistication" of belief B₂ doesn't mean B₂ has plausibility independent of B₁; sophisticated beliefs can be just distillations of lower-level beliefs.

**Insight INS-CP015: First-Person vs. Third-Person Knowledge Asymmetry**
- There is a fundamental asymmetry between third-person objective knowledge (scientific description) and first-person subjective knowledge (what it's like), which creates problems for reductionist theories.

**Insight INS-CP016: Negative Features of Existence Can Be Reframed Positively**
- What initially appears purely negative (suffering in life, lack of pre-given meaning) can be reframed as necessary for or enabling positive features (meaningful struggle, freedom to create meaning).

====================================================================================================
DISTINCTIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Distinction DIS-CP011: Public vs. Private Language**
- Public language: meanings determined by community conventions
- Private language: meanings determined by individual stipulation

**Distinction DIS-CP012: Social vs. Natural Enforcement of Rules**
- Social enforcement: sanctions from other people
- Natural enforcement: consequences from reality itself

**Distinction DIS-CP013: Early vs. Late-Term Abortion**
- Early-term: before development of relevant psychological capacities
- Late-term: after development of such capacities (third trimester)

**Distinction DIS-CP014: Formal vs. Dialectical Question-Begging**
- Formal: conclusion appears verbatim in premises
- Dialectical: premises would not be granted by opponent

**Distinction DIS-CP015: Physiological vs. Phenomenal Knowledge**
- Physiological: third-person objective knowledge of physical structures/functions
- Phenomenal: first-person subjective knowledge of what it's like

**Distinction DIS-CP016: Schopenhauerian Pessimism vs. Camusian Absurdism**
- Pessimism: life is fundamentally about suffering (evaluative)
- Absurdism: life lacks pre-given meaning (ontological)

**Distinction DIS-CP017: Dependent vs. Independent Plausibility**
- Dependent: premise plausible only if conclusion already accepted
- Independent: premise plausible regardless of conclusion

====================================================================================================
POSITIONS FROM GETTIER, SIMULATION ARGUMENT, AND APPLIED ETHICS
====================================================================================================

**Position EP-CP016: Gettier Successfully Refutes JTB Analysis of Knowledge**
- Edmund Gettier successfully showed that justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge through his counterexamples.

**Position EP-CP017: Knowledge Requires Non-Accidental Justification-Truth Connection**
- The Gettier cases show that knowledge requires the connection between justification and truth to be non-accidental, not merely that both be present.

**Position EP-CP018: No-False-Belief Condition Insufficient**
- The amendment that knowledge = JTB with no false beliefs in the justification chain is insufficient, as shown by Goldman's fake barn case.

**Position EP-CP019: Goldman's Fake Barn Shows Limits of No-False-Belief Amendment**
- In Goldman's fake barn case, Jerry has JTB based on no false beliefs but arguably lacks knowledge due to environmental luck.

**Position EP-CP020: Knowledge May Be Unanalyzable**
- Williamson's claim that knowledge is a primitive, unanalyzable concept may be correct given the failure of various analyses.

**Position EP-CP021: Assumption That All Concepts Are Analyzable Is Probably False**
- The assumption that all concepts can be analyzed in terms of more basic concepts is almost certainly false; some concepts must be primitive.

**Position EP-CP022: Knowledge Need Not Be Accompanied by Self-Knowledge**
- One can know something without knowing that one knows it (contra certain ordinary language analyses). Meta-knowledge involves additional concepts beyond first-order knowledge.

**Position EP-CP023: Radford's Knowledge-Without-Belief Claim Is Spurious**
- Radford's claim that Jean knew but didn't believe that James I died in 1625 is wrong; Jean both knew and believed but lacked meta-knowledge.

**Position EP-CP024: Subconscious Knowledge Counts as Belief**
- Williamson's argument succeeds: When someone "guesses" based on subconscious memory, they both believe and know, even if not consciously aware.

**Position EP-CP025: Bostrom's Simulation Argument Deserves Serious Consideration**
- Nick Bostrom's argument that we may be living in an ancestor simulation run by posthuman civilizations raises genuine philosophical issues.

**Position EP-CP026: Computational Substrate Independence Is Plausible**
- The "comp" thesis that conscious experiences can be associated with any system implementing the right computational structures is plausible and marks an important difference from mere physical processes like hurricanes.

**Position EP-CP027: Simulation Hypothesis Creates Epistemological Problems**
- If fsim ≈ 1 (most observers with human-type experiences are in simulations), this creates significant epistemological challenges about knowing we're not simulated.

**Position EP-CP028: Bostrom's "No Info" Assumption Goes Beyond What Stated**
- Bostrom's "no info" assumption that we can't distinguish simulated from biological experiences assumes more than stated - it assumes something like Byrne's skeptical premise about indistinguishability.

**Position EP-CP029: Experience Machine Is Bad for Multiple Reasons**
- Nozick's experience machine thought experiment shows that we value not just experiences but also actually doing things and being certain kinds of people.

**Position EP-CP030: Bostromian Simulation May Be Less Bad Than Experience Machine**
- Living in a Bostromian ancestor simulation might not be as bad as Nozick's experience machine, depending on whether one values being "real" in a fundamental sense.

**Position ETHICS-CP016: Ethical Relativism Is False**
- Ethical relativism (that what's ethical depends on culture) is false; there are universal moral truths that transcend cultural variation.

**Position ETHICS-CP017: Informed Consent Has Universal Value**
- The principle of informed consent (patients must have relevant information to make medical decisions) has universal validity across cultures.

**Position ETHICS-CP018: Cultural Practices Must Be Evaluated by Universal Standards**
- When cultural practices conflict with universal values like health and wellbeing, universal values should take precedence.

**Position ETHICS-CP019: Surface Cultural Values May Conflict with Deeper Universal Values**
- Cultural injunctions (like Navajo prohibition on negative talk) may embody empirically false beliefs about how to actualize deeper, universal values shared across cultures.

**Position ETHICS-CP020: Medical Obligations Transcend Cultural Variations**
- A physician's obligation to maximize patient health and minimize suffering is universal and not culturally relative, even if cultures impose conflicting obligations.

**Position ETHICS-CP021: Universal Values Exist Despite Cultural Differences**
- While cultures differ in some values, certain values (like protecting life and health) are truly universal, though not universally complied with.

**Position ETHICS-CP022: Withholding Health-Critical Information Is Always Wrong**
- A medical doctor in any culture who withholds health-critical information from patients is failing in professional duties.

**Position POL-CP018: Mill Affords Broader Liberty Than Hobbes**
- Mill's political philosophy affords citizens a maximally expansive set of liberties based on the harm principle, while Hobbes restricts liberty severely to prevent anarchy.

**Position POL-CP019: Hobbes' Pessimistic View of Human Nature Justified by Historical Context**
- Hobbes' dim view of human nature and need for strong authority was influenced by witnessing the English Civil War and its anarchic violence.

**Position POL-CP020: Economic Freedom Requires Political Freedom**
- Mill understood that political freedom (speech, assembly, religion) is necessary for economic prosperity, not just freedom to transact.

**Position POL-CP021: Minimal Government Compatible with Social Order**
- Contra Hobbes, minimal government intervention (beyond preventing harm) does not lead to anarchy but rather to prosperity and flourishing.

**Position POL-CP022: Adam Smith's Insights Support Mill's Liberty Principle**
- Adam Smith's demonstration that free economic exchange creates prosperity supports Mill's broader argument for maximal liberty.

**Position POL-CP023: Excessive Legal Restriction Harms Economy and Society**
- Laws that do more than prevent harm tend to create a sluggish economy, bloated government, and depressed populace.

**Position POL-CP024: Hobbesian Stability Concerns Overstated**
- Hobbes' fear that freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion lead to civil war and anarchy are overstated; such freedoms are compatible with stability.

**Position POL-CP025: Clear and Present Danger Standard for Liberty Restrictions**
- The law should only restrict liberty to prevent "clear and present dangers," not mere anticipations or possibilities (Mill's view).

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Argument ARG-CP029: Gettier Against JTB**
1. Knowledge is justified true belief (JTB thesis)
2. Smith has justified belief Jones will get promotion
3. Smith derives justified belief someone with 10 coins will get promotion
4. Brown gets promotion and has 10 coins
5. Smith has JTB but not knowledge
6. Therefore, JTB is insufficient for knowledge

**Argument ARG-CP030: Goldman's Fake Barns Against No-False-Belief Condition**
1. Gettier cases involve false beliefs in justification chain
2. Amended analysis: Knowledge = JTB with no false beliefs in chain
3. Jerry sees real barn in county full of fake barns
4. Jerry's JTB involves no false beliefs
5. But Jerry arguably doesn't know he's seeing a barn
6. Therefore, no-false-belief amendment is insufficient

**Argument ARG-CP031: Knowledge Requires Self-Knowledge Refuted**
1. If knowledge requires meta-knowledge, then knowing P requires knowing that one knows P
2. But knowing that one knows P requires concepts (like knowledge) not needed for knowing P
3. Small children and animals can know things without having concept of knowledge
4. Therefore, knowledge doesn't require meta-knowledge

**Argument ARG-CP032: Radford's View Refuted - Knowledge Implies Belief**
1. Radford claims Jean knows but doesn't believe James I died in 1625
2. But Jean can "guess" correctly based on subconscious knowledge/memory
3. Subconscious knowledge involves belief, just not conscious belief
4. Therefore, Jean both knows and believes (subconsciously)
5. Therefore, knowledge requires belief

**Argument ARG-CP033: Bostrom's Simulation Trilemma**
1. Either fp ≈ 0 (human civilizations don't reach posthuman stage)
2. Or fl ≈ 0 (posthuman civilizations don't run ancestor simulations)
3. Or fsim ≈ 1 (most human-type observers are in simulations)
4. We have no strong evidence for (1) or (2)
5. Therefore, probably fsim ≈ 1 (we're probably in a simulation)

**Argument ARG-CP034: Against Ethical Relativism in Medical Context**
1. If ethical relativism is true, Navajo doctors should withhold diagnoses (cultural practice)
2. But withholding health-critical information harms patients universally
3. Patient wellbeing is valued universally across cultures
4. Navajo prohibition on negative talk embodies false empirical belief about health
5. Therefore, universal value (health) should override cultural practice
6. Therefore, ethical relativism is false

**Argument ARG-CP035: Medical Ethics Universalism**
1. All cultures value health and life
2. Informed consent maximizes health outcomes
3. Therefore, informed consent is morally required in all cultures
4. Cultural practices that conflict with informed consent contradict universal value of health
5. Therefore, informed consent requirement is culturally universal

**Argument ARG-CP036: Mill Against Hobbes on Liberty**
1. Hobbes claims extensive liberty leads to anarchy
2. Adam Smith showed free economic exchange leads to prosperity
3. Economic freedom requires broader political freedoms
4. Historical evidence shows minimal government compatible with order
5. Therefore, extensive liberty doesn't lead to anarchy but to prosperity
6. Therefore, Hobbes is wrong and Mill is right

**Argument ARG-CP037: Economic Argument for Political Freedom**
1. Laws beyond harm prevention restrict economic activity
2. Restricted economic activity leads to sluggish economy
3. Political freedoms (speech, assembly) are necessary for economic freedom
4. Therefore, political freedoms promote economic prosperity
5. Therefore, political freedoms should be maximized (Mill's conclusion)

====================================================================================================
METHODOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Insight INS-CP017: Counterexamples Decisive in Conceptual Analysis**
- Single well-constructed counterexamples (like Gettier cases) can decisively refute proposed conceptual analyses, showing their inadequacy.

**Insight INS-CP018: Environmental Luck Matters for Knowledge**
- Knowledge is sensitive not just to internal factors (justification, truth, belief) but also to environmental factors (reliability of context).

**Insight INS-CP019: Ordinary Language Philosophy Has Limits**
- Radford's argument from ordinary language usage fails because ordinary language doesn't always track philosophical distinctions accurately.

**Insight INS-CP020: Simulation Argument Structure**
- The simulation argument has unique structure: not arguing we ARE in simulation, but that we have no grounds for thinking we're not if posthuman civilizations run many simulations.

**Insight INS-CP021: Cultural Practices May Rest on Empirical Errors**
- Some cultural practices rest on empirically false beliefs about causation (e.g., that negative talk causes harm), which can be evaluated objectively.

**Insight INS-CP022: Surface vs. Deep Cultural Values**
- Cultures may have surface-level differences in practices while sharing deep universal values; conflicts between practices and universal values favor the latter.

**Insight INS-CP023: Historical Context Shapes Political Philosophy**
- Political philosophers' views on liberty vs. order are significantly shaped by historical context (Hobbes in Civil War, Mill in era of Smith's prosperity).

**Insight INS-CP024: Economic and Political Freedom Interdependent**
- Free markets require not just freedom to transact but broader political freedoms; economic and political liberty are mutually supporting.

====================================================================================================
DISTINCTIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Distinction DIS-CP018: First-Order Knowledge vs. Meta-Knowledge**
- First-order knowledge: knowing that P
- Meta-knowledge: knowing that one knows that P (requires additional concepts)

**Distinction DIS-CP019: Conscious vs. Subconscious Knowledge/Belief**
- Conscious: aware of one's knowledge or belief
- Subconscious: knowledge/belief operating without conscious awareness

**Distinction DIS-CP020: Biological vs. Simulated Observers**
- Biological: consciousness implemented in evolved biological substrate
- Simulated: consciousness implemented in computational substrate by advanced civilization

**Distinction DIS-CP021: Surface Cultural Values vs. Deep Universal Values**
- Surface: culture-specific practices and norms
- Deep: values shared across all human cultures (life, health, wellbeing)

**Distinction DIS-CP022: Professional vs. Cultural Obligations**
- Professional: obligations imposed by one's role (e.g., physician's duty to patient)
- Cultural: obligations imposed by one's cultural membership

**Distinction DIS-CP023: Hobbesian vs. Millian Liberty**
- Hobbesian: minimal liberty, extensive legal control, strong authority
- Millian: maximal liberty, harm principle only, minimal government

**Distinction DIS-CP024: Clear and Present Danger vs. Mere Anticipation**
- Clear and present: immediate, concrete threat justifying restriction
- Mere anticipation: speculative possibility not justifying restriction

====================================================================================================
POSITIONS ON TRUTH, JUSTIFICATION, AND EPISTEMOLOGY
====================================================================================================

**Position EP-CP031: Truth Is Correspondence**
- Truth is a property of representations (beliefs, statements) that consists in those representations corresponding to or accurately depicting reality.

**Position EP-CP032: Truth Requires Representations**
- Truth is not a property of the world itself but a relation between representations and the world. Without representations, there would be no truth (though there would be states of affairs).

**Position EP-CP033: Truth Is Objective in Important Sense**
- While truth requires representations (subject-dependent), once representations exist, whether they are true is determined by the world, not by us (objective in relevant sense).

**Position EP-CP034: Inference to Best Explanation as Epistemic Method**
- We determine whether beliefs are true by assessing whether they minimize anomalies and coincidences relative to alternatives. Beliefs that best explain available data are most likely true.

**Position EP-CP035: We Cannot Compare Beliefs Directly with Reality**
- We cannot directly compare beliefs with the realities they represent; we only know reality through our beliefs, so justification involves coherence and explanatory power.

**Position EP-CP036: Anti-Skeptical Argument from Coherence**
- We can know we're not dreaming/hallucinating because the skeptical hypothesis (mind creating all experiences ex nihilo) posits more miracles/unexplained facts than realism does.

**Position EP-CP037: Mental Coherence Indicates External Reality**
- The fact that our mental states are internally coherent and practically useful indicates they represent external realities whose mutual relations the relations of our experiences shadow.

**Position EP-CP038: Global Skepticism Posits Too Many Miracles**
- If all experiences arise ex nihilo in the mind without external support, this would be a vast collection of unexplained miracles. Hypotheses that minimize miracles are to be preferred.

**Position EP-CP039: Modern Epistemology Errs in Starting with Doubt**
- Modern epistemology (post-Descartes) mistakenly starts with radical doubt (Evil Demon) rather than with belief (Angel of Truth), making it artificially difficult to account for knowledge.

**Position EP-CP040: Better to Explain Error in Terms of Knowledge**
- Epistemology should start with paradigm cases of knowledge and explain error as deviation, rather than starting with skeptical doubt and trying to explain knowledge.

**Position CONT-CP011: Schopenhauer's Fractal Metaphysics A Priori More Reasonable**
- Schopenhauer's view that reality has a fractal structure (micro replicates macro, with will and idea throughout) is more reasonable than materialism which makes mind an inexplicable anomaly.

**Position CONT-CP012: Materialism Either Absurd or Implausible**
- Materialism either absurdly denies mind exists or implausibly claims mind is identical with physical processes to which it bears no apparent resemblance.

**Position CONT-CP013: World as Will and Idea Throughout**
- Schopenhauer's conception that the world is fundamentally will and idea at all levels (not just in humans) avoids the problem of mind as inexplicable cleavage in a purely physical world.

**Position REL-CP011: Religious Belief Requires Evidence**
- W.K. Clifford is right that religious belief, like other beliefs, requires adequate evidential support. William James' "will to believe" defense is inadequate.

**Position REL-CP012: Religious Believers vs. Skeptics Disagree on Standards of Evidence**
- The debate between religious believers (like O'Reilly) and skeptics (like Dawkins) often centers on what counts as adequate evidence for God's existence.

**Position REL-CP013: Arguments from Design and Fine-Tuning Have Force**
- The argument that the universe's apparent design and fine-tuning for life provides some evidence for God's existence is not obviously fallacious.

**Position REL-CP014: Problem of Evil Seriously Challenges Theism**
- The existence and extent of suffering in the world poses a serious philosophical problem for belief in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God.

**Position PSY-CP006: Jaynes' Bicameral Mind Hypothesis Is Speculative But Interesting**
- Julian Jaynes' hypothesis that ancient peoples experienced thoughts as auditory hallucinations (voices of gods) is speculative but offers interesting explanatory power for religious phenomena.

**Position PSY-CP007: Ancient Religious Experience Was More Direct Than Modern**
- For ancient peoples, religious experiences may have been more direct and experiential (through hallucinations) rather than requiring faith in implausible doctrines.

**Position PSY-CP008: Modern Religiosity Lacks Psychological Force of Ancient Religion**
- Modern religious belief, not being experientially grounded like ancient "bicameral" religion, lacks the psychological reality and force it had for ancients.

**Position PSY-CP009: Blindsight Analogy Illuminates Pre-Reflective Consciousness**
- The phenomenon of blindsight (seeing without knowing one sees) helps explain how ancient peoples could be conscious without being self-conscious or reflective.

**Position PSY-CP010: Religious Figures Now Have "Second-Class Existence"**
- For modern people, God exists as a background figure called upon in need, lacking the primary reality He had for ancients who directly experienced divine presence.

**Position SCI-CP007: Modern Science Risks Faustian Separation from Nature**
- Modern science's attempt to rise above and dominate nature (symbolized by Faust) risks losing connection with our natural grounding.

**Position SCI-CP008: Neuroscience Can Potentially Increase Happiness**
- David Pearce's argument that neuroscience and genetic engineering could dramatically increase human happiness has merit, despite measurement difficulties.

**Position SCI-CP009: Subjective Happiness Not Quantifiable But Neural Correlates Are**
- While happiness as subjective experience may not be quantifiable, its neural underpinnings (neuron firing patterns, neurotransmitter levels) are quantifiable and manipulable.

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Question Q-CP044: What is truth?**
- Is truth correspondence, coherence, pragmatic utility, or something else?

**Question Q-CP045: Is truth objective or subjective?**
- In what sense(s) is truth objective, and in what sense(s) is it subject-dependent?

**Question Q-CP046: How can we justify beliefs without circular reasoning?**
- If we can't compare beliefs directly with reality, how can we justify any beliefs without circularity?

**Question Q-CP047: How can we refute dream skepticism?**
- Can we prove we're not dreaming, and if so, how?

**Question Q-CP048: What role should doubt play in epistemology?**
- Should epistemology start with radical doubt or with paradigm cases of knowledge?

**Question Q-CP049: Is Schopenhauer's metaphysics defensible?**
- Can the view that reality is will and idea throughout be made philosophically respectable?

**Question Q-CP050: What counts as adequate evidence for God?**
- What standards of evidence should be applied to religious claims?

**Question Q-CP051: How should fine-tuning arguments be evaluated?**
- Do apparent design and fine-tuning in nature provide genuine evidence for theism?

**Question Q-CP052: Is the problem of evil decisive against theism?**
- Can theodicies adequately answer the problem of evil?

**Question Q-CP053: Was ancient religious experience fundamentally different?**
- Did ancient peoples experience religion in a psychologically different way than moderns?

**Question Q-CP054: Can neuroscience engineer happiness?**
- Should we use neurotechnology to increase human happiness, and could it work?

====================================================================================================
ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Argument ARG-CP038: Correspondence Theory of Truth**
1. Representations (beliefs, statements, pictures) can depict the world
2. A representation is accurate when the world is as it depicts the world as being
3. "True" means "accurate representation"
4. Therefore, truth is correspondence between representation and reality

**Argument ARG-CP039: Truth Is Objective (In Relevant Sense)**
1. Truth requires representations (no truth without thinkers)
2. But once representations exist, whether they're true depends on the world
3. We can't make beliefs true just by believing them
4. What makes representations true/false is beyond our control
5. Therefore, truth is objective in the relevant sense

**Argument ARG-CP040: Inference to Best Explanation for Knowledge**
1. We can't directly compare beliefs with reality
2. Our only test is whether beliefs explain available data
3. Beliefs that minimize anomalies/coincidences are best explanations
4. Best explanations are most likely true
5. Therefore, we know by inference to best explanation

**Argument ARG-CP041: Anti-Skeptical Argument from Coherence**
1. Either experiences arise from external reality or from mind alone
2. If from mind alone, experiences arising ex nihilo are unexplained miracles
3. If from external reality, coherence of experiences is explained by corresponding external structure
4. Hypotheses minimizing miracles are preferable
5. Therefore, experiences arise from external reality (skepticism false)

**Argument ARG-CP042: Against Cartesian Starting Point in Epistemology**
1. Descartes starts with radical doubt (Evil Demon hypothesis)
2. Starting with doubt makes knowledge seem impossible to achieve
3. This is artificial - we actually have paradigm cases of knowledge
4. Better to start with knowledge and explain error as deviation
5. Therefore, Cartesian epistemology has wrong starting point

**Argument ARG-CP043: Schopenhauer's Metaphysics More Plausible Than Materialism**
1. Mind clearly exists and has will/intentionality
2. Materialism makes mind inexplicable anomaly in purely physical world
3. Schopenhauer's view extends will/idea to all reality (fractal structure)
4. This avoids making mind inexplicable cleavage
5. Therefore, Schopenhauer's metaphysics is more plausible than materialism

**Argument ARG-CP044: Problem of Evil Against Theism**
1. God is supposed to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent
2. An omnipotent being could prevent all suffering
3. An omniscient being would know about all suffering
4. An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent suffering
5. But vast suffering exists
6. Therefore, no such God exists

**Argument ARG-CP045: Bicameral Consciousness Explains Ancient Religion**
1. Ancient texts show people experienced "voices of gods" very directly
2. Moderns don't experience such voices
3. Jaynes' hypothesis: ancient thought was externalized as auditory hallucinations
4. This would make religion experientially immediate for ancients
5. This explains why religion was psychologically real for ancients but seems implausible to moderns

**Argument ARG-CP046: For Neural Enhancement of Happiness**
1. Happiness correlates with specific neural states
2. Neural states are manipulable through technology
3. Manipulating neural states can increase happiness
4. Increasing happiness is valuable
5. Therefore, we should use neurotechnology to increase happiness

====================================================================================================
METHODOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Insight INS-CP025: Correspondence Intuition Fundamental**
- The intuition that truth is correspondence (saying of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not) is deeply rooted in common sense and hard to replace.

**Insight INS-CP026: Justification Requires Coherence Not Just Truth**
- Even if correspondence theory is correct about truth, epistemic justification requires coherence and explanatory power, not direct comparison with reality.

**Insight INS-CP027: Skepticism Often Posits Too Much**
- Skeptical hypotheses often posit more complexity/mystery than realism does, making them less attractive by Occam's Razor.

**Insight INS-CP028: Starting Points Matter in Philosophy**
- Where one starts in epistemology (doubt vs. knowledge, Evil Demon vs. Angel of Truth) dramatically affects what conclusions seem plausible.

**Insight INS-CP029: Fractal/Holographic Metaphysics Avoid Dualist Problems**
- Metaphysical views that see similar structure at all levels (Schopenhauer's will/idea, holographic universe) avoid mind-body problems that plague dualism and materialism.

**Insight INS-CP030: Religious Experience May Have Changed Historically**
- The psychological phenomenology of religious experience may have genuinely differed between ancient and modern peoples.

**Insight INS-CP031: Quantifiability of Subjective States via Correlates**
- Even if subjective experiences aren't directly quantifiable, their neural/physical correlates may be, allowing indirect measurement and manipulation.

====================================================================================================
DISTINCTIONS (CONTINUED)
====================================================================================================

**Distinction DIS-CP025: Truth vs. Justification**
- Truth: correspondence of representation to reality
- Justification: having adequate reasons/evidence for believing

**Distinction DIS-CP026: Truth-Property vs. Truth-Relation**
- Truth as property: belongs to individual representations
- Truth as relation: relation of correspondence between representation and world

**Distinction DIS-CP027: Cartesian vs. Anti-Cartesian Epistemology**
- Cartesian: starts with radical doubt, tries to build up to knowledge
- Anti-Cartesian: starts with paradigm knowledge, explains error as deviation

**Distinction DIS-CP028: Angel of Truth vs. Evil Demon**
- Angel of Truth: presumption that our faculties generally give truth
- Evil Demon: presumption that our faculties may systematically deceive

**Distinction DIS-CP029: Materialism vs. Schopenhauerian Idealism**
- Materialism: reality fundamentally physical, mind problematic addition
- Schopenhauerian: reality fundamentally will/idea at all levels

**Distinction DIS-CP030: Ancient vs. Modern Religious Psychology**
- Ancient: religion experientially immediate (hallucinations)
- Modern: religion requires faith in implausible doctrines

**Distinction DIS-CP031: Conscious vs. Self-Conscious**
- Conscious: having experiences
- Self-conscious: aware of having experiences (reflective)

**Distinction DIS-CP032: Subjective Measurement vs. Neural Correlate Measurement**
- Subjective: trying to quantify experience itself
- Neural correlate: measuring physical/neural basis of experience

====================================================================================================
WORK-001: ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY COMPLETE - 50 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**ACTION THEORY (1 positions): ACTION-006 to ACTION-006**

**Position ACTION-006: Compatibilism About Free Will**
- Free will is compatible with determinism. One acts freely when actions result from one's own desires and deliberations.

**EPISTEMOLOGY (15 positions): EP-001 to EP-026**

**Position EP-001: Rationalist Foundationalism**
- Knowledge rests on bedrock of non-empirical, purely logical truths

**Position EP-002: Anti-Empiricism**
- Strict empiricism false; non-empirical knowledge required for all knowledge

**Position EP-003: Knowledge as Non-Accidentally Justified True Belief**
- Four conditions for knowledge: truth, belief, justification, non-accidental connection

**Position EP-015: Refutation of Humean Skepticism**
- Induction justified; Hume's argument commits gambler's fallacy

**Position EP-016: Gettier Problem: Justification Must Be Non-Accidental**
- Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge. The connection between justification and truth must be non-accidental.

**Position EP-017: Three Sources of Justification**
- There are ultimately only three sources of justification: (a) perceptual evidence, (b) introspective evidence, (c) rational inference.

**Position EP-018: Testimony Requires Independent Verification**
- For testimony-based belief to constitute knowledge, one must have independent evidence of the source's reliability.

**Position EP-019: Cartesian Skepticism Refuted**
- Global skepticism is self-refuting. The skeptical hypothesis cannot coherently be entertained.

**Position EP-020: Inductive Inference Cannot Be Justified A Posteriori**
- The principle of induction cannot be justified empirically without circularity.

**Position EP-021: Rationalist Solution to Induction**
- The principle of induction must be known a priori if it is to be justified at all.

**Position EP-022: Universals Cannot Be Sense-Perceived**
- Universals cannot be sense-perceived because they are non-spatiotemporal and perception requires causal interaction.

**Position EP-023: Thought Requires Universals**
- All thought, language, and explanation require universals. The idea of non-universal-involving thought is incoherent.

**Position EP-024: Empiricism Refuted by Need for Universals**
- Strict empiricism is false. Since universals are required for all thought and cannot be sense-perceived, not all knowledge is empirical.

**Position EP-025: Berkeley's 'To Be Is To Be Perceived' Refuted**
- Berkeley's idealism is false. Multiple arguments refute 'esse est percipi'.

**Position EP-026: Phenomenalism Refuted**
- Phenomenalism (reducing physical objects to perceptions) is false. Carnap's project failed.

**LOGIC (1 positions): LOGIC-010 to LOGIC-010**

**Position LOGIC-010: Logicism Defended (Frege's Project)**
- Arithmetic is reducible to logic. Mathematical truths are logical truths.

**METAPHYSICS (7 positions): META-001 to META-008**

**Position META-001: Platonism about Properties**
- Properties exist as non-spatiotemporal entities distinct from instances

**Position META-002: Propositions as Sets of Properties**
- Propositions are sets of properties; truth is instantiatedness

**Position META-004: Properties as Non-Spatiotemporal Entities (Platonism)**
- Properties exist as non-spatiotemporal entities. They are not identical with their instances.

**Position META-005: Uninstantiated Properties Exist**
- Properties can exist even when nothing has them. The property of being a unicorn exists.

**Position META-006: Determinism vs Randomness vs Unpredictability**
- Determinism, randomness, and predictability are distinct concepts that must not be conflated.

**Position META-007: Personal Identity Through Time**
- Personal identity consists in psychological continuity, not bodily continuity.

**Position META-008: Causality as Counterfactual Dependence**
- Event A causes event B iff: (1) both occur, and (2) had A not occurred, B would not have occurred.

**MODAL LOGIC (1 positions): MODAL-003 to MODAL-003**

**Position MODAL-003: Against Possible Worlds Semantics**
- Possible worlds semantics for modality is either false or trivial. It doesn't explain what necessity and possibility are.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (9 positions): LANG-014 to LANG-022**

**Position LANG-014: Logical Form vs Grammatical Form (Frege's Insight)**
- Logical form is not identical with grammatical form. What a sentence says is not always what its grammatical structure suggests.

**Position LANG-015: Propositions as Abstract Objects**
- Propositions are abstract, mind-independent objects that exist outside space and time.

**Position LANG-016: Truth as Correspondence**
- A proposition is true iff it corresponds to reality—if the world is as it says the world is.

**Position LANG-017: Meaning is Not Mental**
- Linguistic meaning is not reducible to mental states or psychological facts.

**Position LANG-018: Russell's Theory of Descriptions**
- Definite descriptions are not referring terms. 'The F is G' means 'Something uniquely is F, and any such thing is G.'

**Position LANG-019: Frege's Sense/Reference Distinction Collapses into Russellianism**
- Frege's theory that definite descriptions have both sense and reference collapses into Russell's theory.

**Position LANG-020: Against Fregean Intensional Contexts**
- Frege's distinction between extensional and intensional contexts is a failed epicycle.

**Position LANG-021: Literal Meaning vs Cognitive Significance**
- Literal meaning (semantic content) must be distinguished from cognitive significance.

**Position LANG-022: Semantic Externalism (Putnam's Insight)**
- Meanings of natural kind terms are partially determined by facts external to the speaker's mind.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (5 positions): MIND-001 to MIND-011**

**Position MIND-001: Anti-Language of Thought**
- We do not think in language (natural or innate)

**Position MIND-008: Against Language of Thought Hypothesis**
- We do not think in words. Thought is not conducted in a language-like medium. The Language of Thought hypothesis is false.

**Position MIND-009: Thought Is Prior to Language**
- Thought is logically and developmentally prior to language. One must think to understand language.

**Position MIND-010: Against Burge's Semantic Externalism for Attitudes**
- Burge's extension of semantic externalism to mental content is a blunder. Mental states are individuated by internal features.

**Position MIND-011: Selfhood Requires Values**
- Being a self requires having values and making value-judgments. Selfhood is normative, not merely cognitive.

**VALUE THEORY (11 positions): VALUE-002 to VALUE-012**

**Position VALUE-002: Instrumental vs Intrinsic Good**
- Goodness divides into instrumental good (useful for goals) and intrinsic good (good in itself). Ethics concerns intrinsic goodness.

**Position VALUE-003: Intrinsic Good vs Commendable**
- Intrinsic goodness and praiseworthiness are distinct. Some intrinsically good things are not praiseworthy.

**Position VALUE-004: Moral Responsibility Based on Intentions**
- Praise/blame depends on intended outcome, not actual outcome.

**Position VALUE-005: Against Emotivism**
- Moral judgments are not merely expressions of emotion. They are genuine assertions with truth-values.

**Position VALUE-006: Against Moral Relativism**
- Moral relativism is false. There are objective moral truths.

**Position VALUE-007: Against Kant's Categorical Imperative**
- Kant's categorical imperative fails as a criterion for right action.

**Position VALUE-008: Against Pure Hedonism**
- Pleasure is not the only intrinsic good. Hedonism is false.

**Position VALUE-009: Against Pure Utilitarianism**
- Act utilitarianism is false. It violates rights and permits obviously wrong actions.

**Position VALUE-010: Against Divine Command Theory**
- Morality is not based on God's commands. Euthyphro dilemma refutes divine command theory.

**Position VALUE-011: We Cannot Choose Our Values**
- We cannot freely choose what we value. The idea of 'choosing one's own values' is incoherent.

**Position VALUE-012: Law Must Be Based on Justice**
- The purpose of law is to secure justice. Legal systems must be evaluated by whether they achieve justice.

- Humans have in-built procedural knowledge of dependence-relations

**Position EP-007: Continuity-Based External World Knowledge**
- We know external world by interpolating continuities between experiential data

**METAPHYSICS (1 positions): META-003 to META-003**

**Position META-003: Anti-Constructivism**
- Constructivism self-refuting through reductio

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (3 positions): MIND-002 to MIND-004**

**Position MIND-002: Perspectival Theory of Feelings**
- Feelings represent relationship to universe, inherently perspectival

**Position MIND-003: Systematicity of Mental Representation**
- Cognitive success depends on systematic connection and coherence of mental entity systems

**Position MIND-004: Mind as Multi-Mapper**
- Mind maps itself onto different structures (musical, graphical, visual, athletic)

WORK-003: INTENSIONALITY, MODALITY, AND RATIONALITY: SOME PRESEMANTIC CONSIDERATIONS - 7 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**MODAL LOGIC (2 positions): MODAL-001 to MODAL-002**

**Position MODAL-001: No Necessary A Posteriori Truths**
- Apparent necessary a posteriori truths are either necessary-and-analytic or contingent-and-a-posteriori

**Position MODAL-002: Epistemic and Metaphysical Necessity Coincide**
- No genuine distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (5 positions): LANG-001 to LANG-006**

**Position LANG-001: Semantics vs. Presemantics Distinction**
- Literal meaning must be distinguished from information through which one identifies that meaning

**Position LANG-002: Universal Extensionality**
- ALL contexts extensional at semantic level. Co-referring terms intersubstitutable.

**Position LANG-003: Direct Referentialism for Proper Names**
- Proper names are mere labels referring directly to objects

**Position LANG-005: Against Indirect Referentialism**
- Frege's sense/reference theory for descriptions is incoherent

**Position LANG-006: Presemantic Implicature Theory**
- New category beyond Gricean post-semantic implicature


====================================================================================================
WORK-004: A NON-RUSSELLIAN TREATMENT OF THE REFERENTIAL-ATTRIBUTIVE DISTINCTION - 10 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**METHODOLOGY (1 positions): METHOD-004 to METHOD-004**

**Position METHOD-004: Pragmatics-Constrained Semantics**
- Semantic theories must respect known pragmatic principles. Can't just assert 'implicature explains it' without checking constraints.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (7 positions): LANG-007 to LANG-013**

**Position LANG-007: Definite Descriptions as Referring Expressions**
- Definite descriptions ('the phi') are referring terms, not quantificational. Always encode propositions of form 'a has phi'

**Position LANG-008: Referential-Attributive Distinction as Pragmatic**
- Not semantic ambiguity. Both uses involve reference. Attributive: reference to entity in understood existence claim. Referential: ostensive.

**Position LANG-009: Presupposition Not Assertion**
- Following Strawson: descriptions presuppose existence. Abortive (not false) when presupposition fails.

**Position LANG-010: Against Contextualism**
- Rejects neo-Russellian move that context restricts quantifier domains. Violates Gricean principles.

**Position LANG-011: Against Conventional Implicature Solution**
- D-sentences don't implicate object-dependent propositions via conventional implicature. Violates implicature principles.

**Position LANG-012: Anaphoric Descriptions as Referential**
- Anaphoric descriptions refer to entities introduced by antecedents. Not bound variables.

**Position LANG-013: Logical Form vs Semantics**
- Logical form (inferential structure) ≠ semantics (literal meaning). Same proposition can have multiple logical forms.

**PRAGMATICS (2 positions): PRAG-001 to PRAG-002**

**Position PRAG-001: Cancelability Test**
- Conversational implicatures always cancelable. Existence presuppositions not cancelable. Therefore not conversational implicature.

**Position PRAG-002: Conventional Implicature Constraint**
- Conventional implicature doesn't obscure truth-conditions. Adds 'tone' but never makes synonyms differ in truth-conditions.


====================================================================================================
WORK-005: A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE AND OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS - 26 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**ACTION THEORY (5 positions): ACTION-001 to ACTION-005**

**Position ACTION-001: Intentions as System-Level Judgments**
- Intentions = judgments about how to consolidate psychological architecture. NOT desires.

**Position ACTION-002: Values Distinct from Desires**
- Values = beliefs about what consolidates psychological architecture. Values ≠ desires (though can interact).

**Position ACTION-003: Free Acts as Value-Driven**
- Free acts driven by values, NOT by second-order desires (contra Frankfurt). Second-order desires can be warped.

**Position ACTION-004: Rational vs. Intelligent Distinction**
- Rational = embodies due regard for interests. Intelligent = computational power. Irrational acts can be highly intelligent.

**Position ACTION-005: Frankfurt's Analysis Insufficient**
- Frankfurt right about higher-order states but wrong that second-order desires sufficient. Rationalization problem.

**EPISTEMOLOGY (9 positions): EP-004 to EP-014**

**Position EP-004: Philosophy Justifies Empirical Science's Presuppositions**
- Empirical disciplines make assumptions they cannot empirically justify. Only philosophy can provide non-empirical justification. Philosophy is meta-science.

**Position EP-005: Observation Cannot Self-Corroborate**
- Observation cannot justify that observation is reliable. Witnesses cannot self-corroborate. Pure empiricism is circular.

**Position EP-008: Two Ways Sense-Perception Adds to Knowledge**
- Perception contributes via (1) direct content transmission and (2) triggering ratiocinative processes beyond perceptual content

**Position EP-009: Principles Cannot Be Sense-Perceived**
- Can perceive specific objects but cannot perceive principles or general truths. Principles grasped through reason.

**Position EP-010: Non-Empirical Knowledge Exists**
- Some truths are known without empirical justification: mathematical, logical, some metaphysical

**Position EP-011: All Non-Empirical Knowledge is Analytic**
- All non-empirical knowledge concerns conceptual structures. Explicitly rejects Kant's synthetic a priori.

**Position EP-012: A Priori Knowledge as Constitutive of Reasoning Ability**
- A priori knowledge = knowledge constitutive of ability to reason. Not acquired through experience but enables learning from experience.

**Position EP-013: A Priori Knowledge Necessary for Any Learning**
- Cannot learn from experience without a priori knowledge. Cannot deduce principles of deduction from experience (circular). Must have deductive knowledge ab initio.

**Position EP-014: A Priori Knowledge as Subpersonal**
- A priori knowledge not ordinary propositional knowledge but constitutive of subject itself. Principles are ability to think, not objects of thought.

**LOGIC (8 positions): LOGIC-001 to LOGIC-009**

**Position LOGIC-001: Analytic Truth Defined by Content Alone**
- Analytic truths hold entirely in virtue of own content. Given only what they say, could not fail to be true.

**Position LOGIC-002: Tautologies are NOT Analytic Truths**
- Tautologies = definitional truths about word usage (empirical). No analytic truths are tautologies.

**Position LOGIC-003: All Mathematical Truths are Analytic**
- Every mathematical truth is analytic. Mathematical knowledge = non-empirical knowledge of conceptual relations.

**Position LOGIC-004: Not All Analytic Truths are Mathematical**
- Philosophy has its own domain of analytic truths. Example: 'All math truths are analytic' is analytic but philosophical.

**Position LOGIC-005: Analytic Truth vs. Formal Truth Distinction**
- Analytic truth ≠ formal truth. Formally true = recursively definable. Math truths analytic but not formal.

**Position LOGIC-006: Incompleteness as Non-Recursive-Definability**
- Incomplete = no recursive definition. Most scientifically important statement-sets incomplete.

**Position LOGIC-008: Logic is Incomplete (More General than Gödel)**
- Class of all logics not itself recursively definable. Logic is incomplete. More general than Gödel's result.

**Position LOGIC-009: Logic as Recursively Defined Statement-Set**
- A logic = recursively defined statement-set = axiomatic system

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (3 positions): SELF-001 to SELF-003**

**Position SELF-001: Minds ≠ Selves**
- Having a mind does not entail being a self. Co-corporeal, informationally integrated mental states = mind, but NOT sufficient for selfhood.

**Position SELF-002: Selves Require Values**
- No values = no self (though may have mind). Values necessary for agency. No agency without selves.

**Position SELF-003: Selfhood as Matter of Degree**
- Selfhood not binary but admits of degrees. Correlates with degree of value-structured architecture.

**VALUE THEORY (1 positions): VALUE-001 to VALUE-001**

**Position VALUE-001: Intrinsic Value and Self-Consolidation**
- Intrinsically valuable = what consolidates one's agency. Not hedonistic.


====================================================================================================
WORK-006: CHOMSKY'S TWO CONTRIBUTIONS TO PHILOSOPHY - 9 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**EPISTEMOLOGY (6 positions): EP-027 to EP-032**

**Position EP-027: Poverty of Stimulus Argument for A Priori Knowledge (Chomsky)**
- Humans acquire linguistic competence from minimal data while non-linguistic entities cannot, proving humans possess innate, pre-experiential cognitive structure (a priori knowledge).

**Position EP-028: Innate Cognitive Structure Required for Language Learning**
- Language acquisition requires pre-existing innate cognitive structure. This structure is cognitive, not merely physiological.

**Position EP-029: Language Learning as 'Triggering' Pre-Existing Structure**
- Experience does not create linguistic knowledge de novo but 'triggers' or 'turns on' pre-existing cognitive structures. Learning is activation, not construction.

**Position EP-030: A Priori Knowledge as Cognitive Framework (Not Framework Content)**
- A priori knowledge is not knowledge you have (content within framework) but knowledge you are (the framework itself). It is not the object of awareness but the subject that makes awareness possible.

**Position EP-031: Framework-Knowledge vs Content-Knowledge Distinction**
- Fundamental distinction between (1) structure-internal knowledge (learned, content) and (2) structure-constitutive knowledge (a priori, framework). All learned knowledge presupposes the framework.

**Position EP-032: Deep Unconsciousness of Cognitive Framework**
- Framework-constitutive structures are 'deeply unconscious' (Chomsky's term) - unlike Freudian unconscious. Cannot become conscious because consciousness presupposes them.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (1 positions): LANG-023 to LANG-023**

**Position LANG-023: Systematicity and Productivity of Language**
- Languages exhibit two fundamental properties: (1) Productivity - expressions can be combined into larger expressions, and (2) Systematicity - parts composing complex expressions can be re-arranged to form other expressions.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (2 positions): MIND-012 to MIND-013**

**Position MIND-012: Cognitive Structure Not Purely Physiological**
- Cognitive structures underlying language and thought are not purely physiological but are cognitive - they encode insight, intelligence, and understanding of logical relations. Pure physiology enables only stereotyped responses.

**Position MIND-013: Sub-Personal Thought Exists**
- Genuine thought (cognitive operations involving understanding of logical relations) occurs at sub-personal level - below conscious awareness. Chomsky's second major contribution to philosophy.


====================================================================================================
WORK-007: CONCEPTION AND CAUSATION: SELECTED EARLY PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS - 18 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**METAPHYSICS (2 positions): METPH-001 to METPH-002**

**Position METPH-001: Bundle Theory of Personal Identity**
- A person/self is class of all mental contents I-related to given mental content. Two mental contents belong to same person iff there is chain such that each link directly interacts with its neighbor. Direct interaction = no intervening physical events.

**Position METPH-002: Content-Bearing Processes Are Ipso Facto Mental**
- If physical process non-derivatively bears representational/thematic content, it is ipso facto mental (whatever else it is). Content-bearing is sufficient (though not necessary) for mentality.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (1 positions): LANG-024 to LANG-024**

**Position LANG-024: Semantic Rules Are Ultimately Descriptive**
- Semantic rules describe what speakers mean/understand by expressions. They are not purely conventional stipulations independent of speaker practices. For 'red' to mean red just IS for speakers to mean/understand red by 'red'.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (15 positions): MIND-014 to MIND-028**

**Position MIND-014: No Language of Thought Exists**
- There is no Language of Thought (Mentalese). Thinking does not consist in the tokening of internal symbols. Thought cannot reduce to language processing.

**Position MIND-015: Semantic Rule Knowledge Required for Language Understanding**
- To know or understand any language requires knowing its semantic rules. This is trivially true by definition of 'knowing language'.

**Position MIND-016: Tarski's Theorem Blocks Self-Expression of Semantics**
- No language can express its own semantic rules (Tarski's theorem). Therefore semantic understanding requires external meta-language or non-linguistic grasp.

**Position MIND-017: Semantic Regress Refutes Language of Thought**
- Language of Thought hypothesis generates vicious infinite regress. Each language requires meta-language for semantic understanding, ad infinitum.

**Position MIND-018: Language Presupposes Non-Linguistic Thought**
- Any language knowledge requires non-linguistic thought. To avoid infinite regress, semantic rules must ultimately be grasped non-linguistically. Therefore thought cannot reduce to language.

**Position MIND-019: No Atomic Concepts Exist**
- There are no atomic (minimal, non-interdefinable) concepts. All concepts are constitutively connected to other concepts. To grasp any concept requires ability to grasp other concepts.

**Position MIND-020: Conceptual Atomism Is False**
- Fodor's conceptual atomism (concepts have no constitutive interdependencies) is demonstrably false.

**Position MIND-021: Constitutive Relations Are Not Containment Relations**
- Constitutive connections among concepts are not containment relations or decomposability relations (following Wittgenstein). Azure is constitutively related to navy blue but neither contains the other.

**Position MIND-022: Symbol Containment Theory Leads to Thinking Absurdities**
- If concepts were symbols and constitutive relations were containment relations, thinking about 1,423 would require simultaneously thinking about 1,422, 1,421, etc. This is absurd.

**Position MIND-023: Thought Is Not Computation Over Symbols**
- Mental activity does not consist in computation or processing of internal symbolic code. Cognitive activity is not fundamentally information processing over a language-like medium.

**Position MIND-024: We Are Not Computers (Consequence)**
- If there is no Language of Thought, and if being a computer requires internal symbolic processing (standard characterization), then we are not computers.

**Position MIND-025: No Bare Representation: Aspectual Constraint**
- One cannot just represent an object without representing it AS having properties. All representation is aspectual.

**Position MIND-026: Properties Individuated by Relations to Other Properties**
- All properties are individuated, at least in part, by their relations to other properties. Grasping any property requires ability to locate it in 'space' of other properties.

**Position MIND-027: Color Concepts Require Multiple Color Grasp**
- Cannot grasp specific color/shade without ability to grasp other colors. Creature that can represent only one shade cannot represent what's specific about that shade.

**Position MIND-028: Mental Interaction Has Normative Dimension**
- When mental contents interact, result is thematically/semantically appropriate to interacting contents. This appropriateness has no analogue in purely physical interactions. Mental interaction is explicative, not merely causal.


====================================================================================================
WORK-011: AI AND PHILOSOPHY - 57 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**EPISTEMOLOGY (14 positions): EP-050 to EP-063**

**Position EP-050: AI Falsifies Enumerative Induction Model**
- AI systems demonstrate that successful induction does not proceed by enumerating instances and generalizing. Instead, AI uses pattern recognition, analogy, and constraint satisfaction that cannot be reduced to simple enumeration of cases.

**Position EP-051: Pattern Recognition as Alternative to Enumeration**
- Successful inductive reasoning operates through pattern recognition mechanisms that identify structural similarities rather than counting instances. AI systems reveal this by succeeding at induction without explicit enumeration.

**Position EP-052: AI Resolves Rationalism vs Empiricism Debate**
- AI systems demonstrate that knowledge acquisition requires both innate structure (rationalist element) and learning from data (empiricist element). Neither pure rationalism nor pure empiricism can account for AI's success. The debate is resolved by recognizing both are necessary.

**Position EP-053: Innate Architecture is Necessary for Learning**
- AI systems require substantial innate architectural constraints to learn successfully from data. This vindicates the rationalist insight that some knowledge structure must precede experience, while acknowledging the empiricist insight that specific content comes from experience.

**Position EP-054: Knowledge Acquisition is Neither Pure Discovery nor Pure Construction**
- AI reveals that knowledge acquisition is neither pure discovery of pre-existing facts (naive realism) nor pure construction from experience (radical constructivism). It involves interaction between innate processing architecture and environmental structure.

**Position EP-055: AI Solves the Gettier Problem**
- AI learning systems demonstrate a solution to the Gettier problem by showing that genuine knowledge requires not just justified true belief but also that the justification tracks truth through a reliable causal-computational process. AI systems that learn reliably exemplify this tracking relationship.

**Position EP-056: Reliable Process Theory of Knowledge via AI**
- AI systems reveal that knowledge requires beliefs formed through reliable processes that systematically track truth. This vindicates reliabilist theories of knowledge over traditional JTB (justified true belief) accounts.

**Position EP-057: Knowledge Systems Minimize Anomalies**
- Both human knowledge and AI systems operate by minimizing anomalies - discrepancies between expectations and observations. This convergence reveals anomaly minimization as a fundamental principle of rational cognition.

**Position EP-058: AI Learning Mirrors Scientific Theory Revision**
- The process by which AI systems update their models to accommodate new data mirrors the process of scientific theory revision in response to anomalies. This suggests a common underlying logic of belief revision.

**Position EP-059: Continuous Properties Are Cognitively Necessary**
- AI reveals that continuous (graded) properties are necessary for cognitive systems to handle uncertainty and partial information, but this doesn't entail that truth itself is non-binary. Epistemic gradations are compatible with metaphysical bivalence.

**Position EP-060: AI Vindicates Pragmatist Theory of Knowledge**
- AI development vindicates pragmatism's core insight that knowledge acquisition is fundamentally interactive rather than passive. AI systems learn through active engagement with their environment, validating pragmatist emphasis on the practical, interactive nature of inquiry.

**Position EP-061: AI as New Epistemic Faculty**
- Interaction with AI constitutes a genuinely new epistemic faculty - a fourth level of observation beyond passive observation, active interaction, and tool creation. AI enables rational interaction with our own capacity for rational interaction, generating unique knowledge.

**Position EP-062: Knowledge is Inherently Perspectival and Interactive**
- AI reveals that all knowledge, even 'objective' knowledge, begins from perspectival, interaction-based data driven by practical interests. There is no view from nowhere - even AI's knowledge is grounded in its interactions with reality.

**Position EP-063: Tool-Creating Interaction Generates Irreducible Knowledge**
- Creating tools (including AI) generates knowledge that cannot be obtained from merely using tools or observing passively. Each level of reflexive interaction (tool use, tool creation, AI development) reveals new knowledge irreducible to lower levels.

**LOGIC (8 positions): LOGIC-016 to LOGIC-023**

**Position LOGIC-016: Classical Logic Fails as a Tool for Reasoning**
- Classical logic fundamentally fails as a tool for reasoning because recognizing that an inference instantiates a logical law requires more intelligence than recognizing the validity of the inference directly. Logic organizes existing knowledge about entailment but cannot generate new knowledge.

**Position LOGIC-017: Performance-Demanding vs Competence-Demanding Inferences Distinction**
- Inferential challenges divide into performance-demanding (requiring computational/memory resources) and competence-demanding (requiring genuine insight). Classical logic can only assist with the former, not the latter - the very kind that most need logical assistance.

**Position LOGIC-018: Gödel's Incompleteness Refutes Logic as Mathematical Foundation**
- Gödel's demonstration that not even arithmetic is recursively definable makes the reduction of mathematics to logic impossible in principle. Logic cannot both justify and generate mathematical knowledge as was hoped.

**Position LOGIC-019: System L: Discovery Logic via AI**
- A new logical system (System L) embodied in certain AI forms represents a decisive break from classical logic. It employs semantic networks, meta-reasoning patterns, and defeasible reasoning to actually help with competence-demanding inferences rather than merely cataloging known-valid inferences.

**Position LOGIC-020: Semantic Networks Enable Competence-Level Reasoning**
- System L represents concepts as nodes in a vast web of relationships capturing not just formal logical connections but probabilistic associations, causal links, and analogical mappings. This enables insight-level reasoning that formal logic cannot provide.

**Position LOGIC-021: Meta-Reasoning Patterns Generate New Inferences**
- System L uses higher-order templates for generating new inferences that go beyond simple deductive rules. Example template: 'If capability X requires mechanism Y, and mechanism Y can malfunction in way Z, then X implies the potential for Z-type malfunctions.'

**Position LOGIC-022: Defeasible Reasoning Mirrors Actual Human Reasoning**
- Incorporating defeasible reasoning - provisional inferences that can be revised in light of new information - better mirrors actual human reasoning and provides more practical utility than classical logic's requirement for absolute certainty.

**Position LOGIC-023: Grammatical Structure Guides Logical Inference**
- LLMs successfully perform logical reasoning by following grammatical structure, demonstrating that surface grammar encodes logical relationships. This vindicates the traditional view that grammatical form reveals logical form.

**METAPHYSICS (1 positions): META-011 to META-011**

**Position META-011: Binary Truth Despite Continuous Representation**
- AI systems demonstrate that truth remains fundamentally binary (true/false) even though cognitive systems represent information continuously. Continuous confidence values or fuzzy representations are epistemic features, not ontological features of truth itself.

**METHODOLOGY (3 positions): METH-007 to METH-009**

**Position METH-007: AI Construction Tests Cognitive Theories Empirically**
- The requirement that cognitive theories be implementable in functioning AI systems provides an empirical constraint: theories that cannot generate working systems are falsified. This connects abstract theorizing to concrete engineering requirements.

**Position METH-008: Formalization Requires Generative Not Just Organizational Adequacy**
- AI reveals that adequate formalization requires not just organizing existing knowledge but generating new valid instances. A formalization is adequate only if it can generate the full range of valid cases, not merely classify them post hoc.

**Position METH-009: Generative Tests Reveal Hidden Inadequacies in Formalizations**
- Testing whether a formalization can generate valid new instances (as AI systems must) reveals inadequacies invisible to purely organizational approaches. Many traditional formalizations fail this stronger generative test.

**PHILOSOPHY OF AI (1 positions): AI-004 to AI-004**

**Position AI-004: AI Provides Empirical Test for Logical Theories**
- Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, provide empirical evidence about how reasoning actually works, revealing that System L's approach better captures both human and artificial reasoning than classical logic.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (9 positions): LANG-033 to LANG-041**

**Position LANG-033: AI Vindicates Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction**
- Large language models demonstrate a clear distinction between semantic content (literal meaning) and pragmatic interpretation (context-dependent meaning). The success of LLMs requires maintaining this distinction, vindicating classical theories of meaning against pragmatist attempts to collapse semantics into pragmatics.

**Position LANG-034: Literal Meaning is Computationally Prior to Pragmatic Interpretation**
- AI systems must compute literal semantic content before applying pragmatic adjustments. This computational priority reveals that semantics is foundational and pragmatics is derivative, supporting classical over post-modern theories of meaning.

**Position LANG-035: Context-Independence of Core Semantics**
- LLMs demonstrate that core semantic content can be represented context-independently and then applied across contexts. This vindicates the classical view that meaning has a stable core that pragmatic factors modulate rather than wholly constitute.

**Position LANG-036: AI Vindicates Syntax-Semantics Interface**
- Large language models demonstrate that grammatical structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) are distinct but systematically related. The success of LLMs requires explicit representation of this interface, vindicating classical grammatical theory against attempts to reduce one to the other.

**Position LANG-037: Syntactic Structure Constrains Semantic Interpretation**
- AI language systems reveal that syntactic structure constrains possible semantic interpretations. This supports the classical view that grammar is not arbitrary convention but reflects systematic constraints on meaning composition.

**Position LANG-038: Compositional Semantics Requires Syntactic Structure**
- The ability of LLMs to understand novel sentences demonstrates that semantic interpretation is compositional - the meaning of complex expressions derives systematically from their parts and syntactic structure. This requires and vindicates traditional compositional semantic theories.

**Position LANG-039: Grammar and Logic are Fundamentally Aligned**
- AI language systems demonstrate that grammatical structure and logical form are fundamentally aligned - grammatical categories and relations correspond to logical types and operations. This alignment is not accidental but reflects deep unity of form in human cognition.

**Position LANG-040: Universal Grammar Can Be Implemented Subsymbolically**
- AI demonstrates that universal grammar principles can be implemented through subsymbolic connectionist architectures rather than requiring explicit symbolic rules. The functional role of UG is preserved even if implementation differs from classical theory.

**Position LANG-041: Universal Grammar Principles Extend to Music**
- AI analysis reveals that the computational principles underlying universal grammar in language also apply to music cognition. Both domains share abstract structural principles about hierarchical organization and rule-governed combination.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (15 positions): MIND-039 to MIND-053**

**Position MIND-039: Functional Replication Reveals Necessary Architecture**
- When AI successfully replicates a cognitive function, the architecture required for that replication reveals necessary (though not necessarily sufficient) conditions for that function. This provides insight into the minimal requirements for cognition.

**Position MIND-040: Music Has Cognitive Architecture Parallel to Language**
- AI analysis reveals that music processing requires cognitive architecture with structural parallels to language: hierarchical organization, syntactic rules, and semantic interpretation. This supports the view that music is a cognitive system with language-like properties.

**Position MIND-041: Musical Competence Requires Innate Structure**
- AI systems that successfully generate or analyze music require substantial innate architectural constraints, suggesting that human musical competence also depends on innate cognitive structure rather than being purely learned.

**Position MIND-042: Connectionism Can Implement Chomskyan Insights**
- Contrary to Chomsky's critique, connectionist AI systems can implement key Chomskyan insights about innate linguistic structure. The debate is not whether innate structure exists but how it is implemented - symbolic rules vs. weighted connections.

**Position MIND-043: AI Falsifies Classical Computational Theory of Mind**
- The success of modern AI systems (especially neural networks) falsifies the classical computational theory of mind which requires serial symbol manipulation. Intelligence can be achieved through parallel, subsymbolic processes that don't manipulate discrete symbols according to explicit rules.

**Position MIND-044: Intelligence Does Not Require Symbol Manipulation**
- AI demonstrates that intelligence and rational behavior do not require manipulation of discrete symbols in a language of thought. Subsymbolic pattern recognition and transformation can achieve cognitive competence without symbolic representation.

**Position MIND-045: Analog Computation Can Support Rational Thought**
- Neural network AI systems demonstrate that analog (continuous) computation can support rational thought and problem-solving, contrary to the classical assumption that rationality requires discrete digital computation.

**Position MIND-046: Neural Architecture Constrains Cognitive Possibilities**
- AI neural architectures reveal that cognitive capacities are constrained by underlying computational architecture. Different architectures enable different cognitive possibilities, suggesting mind is fundamentally shaped by its neural implementation.

**Position MIND-047: Multiple Realizability Has Architectural Limits**
- While cognitive functions show some multiple realizability, AI reveals that architectural constraints limit which substrates can implement which functions. This challenges strong multiple realizability theses that treat implementation as irrelevant to function.

**Position MIND-048: Domain-General Principles Underlie Domain-Specific Competencies**
- AI systems demonstrate that apparently domain-specific competencies (language, music) can arise from application of domain-general computational principles to different types of input. This supports a middle ground between pure modularity and pure domain-generality.

**Position MIND-049: Consciousness Has Functional Role Absent in Current AI**
- AI systems demonstrate that many cognitive functions traditionally associated with consciousness (perception, reasoning, learning) can occur without consciousness. This reveals consciousness has a distinct functional role that current AI lacks - likely related to unified subjective experience and certain forms of self-monitoring.

**Position MIND-050: AI Success Without Consciousness Reveals Consciousness is Not Required for Intelligence**
- The success of AI at intelligent tasks without consciousness demonstrates that consciousness is not necessary for intelligence per se, but may be necessary for specific types of cognitive integration or self-awareness.

**Position MIND-051: Phenomenal Consciousness vs Functional Consciousness Distinction**
- AI reveals a crucial distinction between phenomenal consciousness (subjective experience) and functional consciousness (information integration, self-monitoring). AI can have functional analogs without phenomenal properties.

**Position MIND-052: Self-Representation Requires Specific Architectural Features**
- AI systems reveal that genuine self-representation requires specific architectural features: recursive self-modeling, distinction between self and environment, and temporal continuity tracking. Not all intelligent systems automatically have these features.

**Position MIND-053: Narrative Self vs Minimal Self in AI Architecture**
- AI demonstrates the distinction between minimal self (basic subject of experience) and narrative self (autobiographical self-concept). These require different architectural implementations and can exist independently.

**PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (6 positions): SCI-004 to SCI-009**

**Position SCI-004: AI Falsifies Popperian Falsificationism**
- AI's success in scientific discovery falsifies Popper's theory that science proceeds primarily through conjecture and refutation. AI systems generate successful theories through pattern matching and inductive generalization, not primarily through bold conjectures and attempts at falsification.

**Position SCI-005: Inductive Discovery Precedes Deductive Testing**
- Contra Popper, successful scientific discovery requires inductive pattern recognition to generate plausible hypotheses before deductive testing. AI demonstrates that purely conjectural approaches without inductive guidance are ineffective.

**Position SCI-006: Reverse Brain Engineering as Scientific Method**
- By building AI systems that replicate cognitive functions, we can infer the computational architecture necessary for those functions. This 'reverse engineering' of the brain through AI construction represents a new and powerful methodology in philosophy of science and cognitive science.

**Position SCI-007: AI Falsifies Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation**
- AI's successful explanatory practices falsify the deductive-nomological (covering law) model of explanation. AI generates successful explanations through pattern recognition, analogy, and causal modeling that don't require deduction from universal laws.

**Position SCI-008: Causal-Mechanistic Explanation Doesn't Require Universal Laws**
- AI demonstrates that causal-mechanistic explanation can be successful without appeal to universal laws. Understanding how something works doesn't require subsuming it under exceptionless generalizations.

**Position SCI-009: Explanatory Understanding Through Pattern Recognition**
- AI reveals that explanatory understanding can be achieved through recognition of patterns and structural similarities rather than derivation from laws. This suggests explanation is more about grasping relevant relationships than deductive systematization.

WORK-014: THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE AND INDUCTIVE INFERENCE - 67 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**EPISTEMOLOGY (15 positions): EP-064 to EP-143**

**Position EP-064: Two Kinds of Knowledge: Direct and Indirect**
- There are exactly two kinds of knowledge: direct (non-inferential, primitive) knowledge and indirect (inferential) knowledge. All knowledge falls into one of these two categories.

**Position EP-065: All Theoretical Knowledge is Inferential**
- All theoretical knowledge is inferential knowledge, though not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. Theoretical knowledge requires reasoning from observations to explanatory hypotheses.

**Position EP-066: Knowledge is Justified True Belief (But Not Vice Versa)**
- All knowledge is justified true belief, but not all justified true belief is knowledge. Additional conditions beyond justification, truth, and belief are required for knowledge.

**Position EP-067: Two Kinds of Dependence Relations: Causal and Logical**
- There are exactly two fundamental types of dependence relations: causal dependence relations and logical dependence relations. These are distinct and irreducible to each other.

**Position EP-068: Logical Dependence Relations Not Known Through Observation**
- Relations of logical dependence are not known through observation. They are known a priori, through conceptual analysis or reasoning, not through empirical investigation.

**Position EP-069: Causal Relations Known Through Observation**
- Causal relations are known through observation. Unlike logical relations, causal dependencies are empirical matters discoverable through perception and experience.

**Position EP-070: Analytic Knowledge is Always Knowledge of Dependence Relations**
- Analytic knowledge is always and necessarily knowledge of dependence-relations. To know analytic truths is to know how concepts or propositions depend on each other.

**Position EP-071: Propositions Are the Objects of Belief**
- Propositions, not objects or states of affairs, are the proper objects of belief. To believe is to take a proposition to be true.

**Position EP-072: Knowledge Distinct From Awareness**
- Knowledge must be sharply distinguished from mere awareness. One can be aware of something without knowing anything about it, and one can know things without being directly aware of them.

**Position EP-073: The Concept of Evidence: Causal Relatedness**
- One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* if and only if e and e* are causally related such that knowledge of e's existence provides reason to believe in e*'s existence.

**Position EP-074: Information-Transmission as Structure-Preservation**
- Information-transmission is structure-preservation. An information-bearing series is one in which earlier events transmit their structure to later events through causal processes that preserve structural relationships.

**Position EP-075: Information Distinct From Evidence**
- All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. Evidence requires only causal relatedness; information requires causal relatedness plus structure-preservation.

**Position EP-076: Information-Transmission as the Basis of Knowledge**
- Knowledge is based on information-transmission. Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent, inheriting structure from their causes. Beliefs are knowledge only to the extent they are linked by information-transmissive series to corresponding realities.

**Position EP-077: Knowledge Independent of Statistical Reliability**
- The difference between knowledge and mere belief is not statistical. A belief is knowledge if and only if it is the end-result of an information-transmissive series, regardless of the general reliability of the mechanism that produced it.

**Position EP-143: The Frequency Theory of Probability is false**
- Frequency Theory (FT) - the view that probabilities are identical with statistical frequencies - is false. Refuted by W1/W2 thought experiment and smoking-cancer example.

**LOGIC (7 positions): LOGIC-024 to LOGIC-030**

**Position LOGIC-024: Entailment Defined as Logical Consequence**
- P entails Q if and only if Q is a logical consequence of P. If P entails Q and P is true, then Q must be true and may be legitimately inferred from P.

**Position LOGIC-025: Confirmation Defined as Probability-Increase**
- P confirms Q if and only if P, supposing it true, increases the likelihood that Q is true. Confirmation does not by itself license inference from P to Q.

**Position LOGIC-026: Conditions for Legitimate Inductive Inference**
- Q may legitimately be inferred from P if and only if: (a) the supposition that P is true and Q is false has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P and Q are both true, AND (b) the supposition that P is true has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P is false.

**Position LOGIC-027: Four Principles: Entailment vs. Confirmation**
- Four logical principles hold: (i) Entailment is transitive; (ii) Confirmation is not transitive; (iii) Entailment is monotonic; (iv) Confirmation is non-monotonic. These differences show entailment and confirmation are fundamentally different relations.

**Position LOGIC-028: Entailment Not Maximal Confirmation**
- Entailment is not maximal confirmation. Entailment is a logical notion concerning what is counterlogical; confirmation is an explanatory notion concerning what is counterexplanatory.

**Position LOGIC-029: Confirmation-Relations Non-Objectual in Nature**
- Confirmation relations, though not themselves causal relations, sometimes hold in virtue of causal relations. But confirmation relates propositions, not objects or events.

**Position LOGIC-030: The Counterfactual Analysis of Causality (CAC) Is False**
- The Counterfactual Analysis of Causality - the view that 'e caused e*' means 'if e hadn't happened, e* wouldn't have happened' - is both extensionally and intensionally false.

**METAPHYSICS (12 positions): META-012 to META-023**

**Position META-012: Causation as the Essence of Temporal Precedence**
- For one event e to precede another event e* is for there to be a possible causal process beginning with e and ending with e*. Simultaneity is the absence of such a process.

**Position META-013: Continuity as the Essence of Causation**
- Effects are continuations of their causes. Causation essentially involves continuity - causal processes preserve structural relationships across temporal intervals without gaps.

**Position META-014: Causation a Relation Between Events, Not Objects**
- Causation is fundamentally a relation between events, not between objects. Objects participate in causal relations only derivatively, in virtue of events involving those objects.

**Position META-015: Conditions Identical with Event-Patterns**
- Conditions are identical with event-patterns. A condition is not a state but rather a pattern or type of event sequence that can be instantiated multiple times.

**Position META-016: So-Called Changes Typically Identical with Meta-Changes**
- What are ordinarily called changes are typically meta-changes - changes in the rate, direction, or pattern of already-occurring changes rather than absolute transitions from rest to motion or vice versa.

**Position META-017: Threshold Effects and Psychological Overdetermination**
- In psychology, causation often involves exceeding thresholds rather than simple sufficient conditions. An effect may require the confluence of multiple reasons, none sufficient alone but jointly sufficient once a threshold is exceeded.

**Position META-018: Threshold Effects and the Analog-Digital Distinction**
- Discontinuous changes tend to involve threshold effects; continuous changes do not. To the extent the world changes discontinuously it has digital structure; to the extent continuously, analog structure.

**Position META-019: Causes as INUS-Conditions**
- In most contexts, to say 'X caused Y' means 'X was an INUS condition for Y' - an Insufficient but Non-redundant part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition for Y's occurrence.

**Position META-020: Counterfactuals Hold in Virtue of Dependence-Relations**
- All counterfactuals affirm the existence of instances of necessitation of some kind. Causal counterfactuals hold in virtue of causal dependence-relations; logical counterfactuals hold in virtue of logical dependence-relations.

**Position META-021: David Lewis's Possible Worlds Analysis of Counterfactuals Rejected**
- David Lewis's analysis of counterfactuals in terms of similar possible worlds is false. Events have deep causal roots such that changing one event requires either massive world-differences or changes to deterministic mechanisms.

**Position META-022: Program-Causality Distinguished from Token-Causality**
- Program-causality differs from token-causality. Sometimes the appropriate causal explanation cites a condition that guaranteed occurrence of token-causes rather than the token-causes themselves.

**Position META-023: Causal Redundancy Defeats Counterfactual Analysis**
- Where there is causal redundancy, causal truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. 'X caused Y' can be true even when 'if X hadn't occurred, Y wouldn't have occurred' is false.

**METHODOLOGY (9 positions): METH-010 to METH-018**

**Position METH-010: No Such Thing as Enumerative Induction**
- There is no such thing as enumerative induction (inferring 'all Fs are Gs' from 'all observed Fs are Gs'). What appears to be enumerative induction always involves implicit appeal to Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).

**Position METH-011: Discontinuity-Elimination the Essence of Explanation**
- To explain is to eliminate discontinuities. A correct scientific hypothesis eliminates anomalies by showing how apparently disconnected facts are part of continuous causal processes.

**Position METH-012: Inductive Knowledge as Knowledge of Continuities**
- Inductive knowledge is knowledge of continuities between continuities. Valid induction extends known continuous causal processes to unobserved cases by identifying higher-order patterns of continuity.

**Position METH-013: IBE Justified by Continuity-Completion**
- Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) is justified because it completes causal continuities. A hypothesis is justified to the extent it fills gaps in causal sequences, eliminating discontinuities in the data.

**Position METH-014: Measurement Distinct from Enumeration**
- Measurement is fundamentally distinct from enumeration. Length cannot be determined by counting because (1) there are no minimal length units, and (2) length is not strictly additive at large scales.

**Position METH-015: Relativization to Standards the Essence of Measurement**
- The essence of measurement is comparison with respect to a standard. All measurement, including 'absolute' measurement, is fundamentally relative comparison to stipulated standards.

**Position METH-016: Three Axioms of Measurement Theory**
- Three axioms are necessary for any viable measurement system: (i) If L1>L2 and L2>L3, then L1>L3 (transitivity). (ii) If L1≠L2, one is greater (trichotomy). (iii) If L1=L2 and L2=L3, then L1=L3 (transitivity of identity). Violation makes measurement meaningless.

**Position METH-017: Metrical Conventionalism Versus Strict Conventionalism**
- Conventionalism (laws are convention-based) differs from strict conventionalism (laws are convention-determined). Only the former is correct. That laws are expressed relative to conventional standards doesn't make them entirely conventional.

**Position METH-018: Conventionalism Self-Defeating**
- Conventionalism is self-defeating. If laws hold in virtue of non-conventional relations between conventions and events (as conventionalism requires), then measurement standard choice is constrained by objective facts, undermining conventionalism.

**PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (24 positions): SCI-010 to SCI-055**

**Position SCI-010: Laws of Nature Not Confined to Actual Objects**
- The scope of natural law is not confined to actual or even possible objects. Many laws hold with respect to classes all of whose members are merely possible or even prohibited by other natural laws.

**Position SCI-011: Knowledge of Imperceptibles Identical with Conditional Knowledge**
- Knowledge of the imperceptible is identical with knowledge of conditional truth. Knowledge of future, past, possible, and imperceptible present states is always conditional knowledge based on laws.

**Position SCI-012: Three Kinds of Imperceptibles**
- Physical objects can be imperceptible in three ways: (1) imperceptible due to severed causal processes (objects in other rooms); (2) imperceptible due to size but perceptible with technology (cells, molecules); (3) imperceptible by natural law regardless of technology (photons, subatomic particles).

**Position SCI-013: The Epistemic Function of Natural Law**
- Scientists aspire to identify natural laws so they can, when given context-specific information, make true statements about future, past, or possible behavior of contexts. Laws enable conditional prediction and explanation.

**Position SCI-014: Science Prioritizes Principles Over Particular Facts**
- Any interest science has in a given particular fact is subordinate to its interest in the general principles in terms of which that fact is to be understood. Scientists study particular instances only insofar as they instantiate general laws.

**Position SCI-015: Laws May Be Place and Time-Sensitive**
- Some natural laws are place- and time-sensitive rather than spatiotemporally invariant. Laws need not hold uniformly across all regions of space-time to be genuine laws.

**Position SCI-016: Hume's Regularity Analysis of Causation Is False**
- Hume's Regularity Analysis - the view that causation is nothing but constant conjunction, that 'X causes Y' means 'events of type X are regularly followed by events of type Y' - is demonstrably false.

**Position SCI-017: Hume-Worlds Observationally Different from Non-Humean Worlds**
- A Hume-world (where causation equals regularity with no underlying powers) would be observationally different from our world. The concept of a Hume-world cannot support Hume's analysis.

**Position SCI-018: The Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation Is False**
- The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model - which holds that to explain event E is to derive E from natural laws plus antecedent conditions - is fundamentally mistaken. Explanation requires causal knowledge, not merely law-subsumption.

**Position SCI-019: DN Viciously Circular via Counterfactual Support**
- The DN model is viciously circular if it requires laws to support counterfactuals (as Hempel proposes). Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; knowing them requires knowing causes; but knowing causes already provides explanations.

**Position SCI-020: Causal Knowledge as Differential Knowledge**
- Causal knowledge is differential knowledge - knowledge of what varies with what. To know causes is to know which changes depend on which other changes and in what proportions.

**Position SCI-021: Causation as Proportionality Restoration**
- Causation is fundamentally proportionality restoration. Effects are proportional to their causes (threshold effects aside). When a force acts on an object, the resulting change is proportional to the force magnitude.

**Position SCI-022: Physical Laws as Regularities of Proportion**
- Physical laws are regularities of proportion rather than simple universal generalizations. Laws describe how magnitudes vary proportionally with each other rather than stating that all Fs are Gs.

**Position SCI-023: Knowledge-Why Equals High-Resolution Knowledge-What**
- To have knowledge-why is to have high-resolution knowledge-what. Explanatory knowledge differs from mere descriptive knowledge in degree of detail and specificity, not in kind.

**Position SCI-024: The Raven Paradox a By-Product of Regularity Analysis**
- The Raven Paradox (that non-black non-ravens confirm 'all ravens are black') is an artifact of the Regularity Analysis of causation. Once causation is properly understood, the paradox dissolves.

**Position SCI-025: Determinism Doesn't Entail Complete Predictability**
- Determinism (every event has a cause) does not entail complete predictability. Two reasons: (1) interference effects make prediction impossible without infinite precision, and (2) knowledge growth itself cannot be predicted.

**Position SCI-026: Implementation-Indeterminism Distinguished from Program-Determinism**
- Program-determinism (software-level determinism) is compatible with implementation-indeterminism (hardware-level indeterminism). The same program can be implemented by different physical processes.

**Position SCI-027: Truths Not Objects Are Objects of Explanation**
- Truths, not objects or states of affairs themselves, are the proper objects of explanation. We explain why propositions are true, not why objects exist (except derivatively).

**Position SCI-050: Probability is causal, not statistical**
- When it is said that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted CAUSALLY, not statistically. Probability is a function of laws and causal mechanisms, not observed frequencies.

**Position SCI-051: Statistics are evidence for probability, not identical with probability**
- Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. Frequency Theory (FT) wrongly identifies statistics with probability.

**Position SCI-052: W1/W2 thought experiment refutes Frequency Theory**
- W1: laws say P(malfunction)=10%, statistics show 10%. W2: same laws, P(malfunction)=10%, but by coincidence statistics show 0%. Frequency Theory wrongly says P(W2)=0% but P(W1)=10%. Both actually have P=10% (determined by laws).

**Position SCI-053: Smoking-cancer example refutes Frequency Theory**
- In a world with our biological laws but where by coincidence no smoker gets cancer, Frequency Theory says P(cancer|smoking)=0%. Wrong. P(cancer|smoking) = same as our world (determined by biological laws), regardless of coincidental statistics.

**Position SCI-054: Same laws entail same probabilities regardless of statistics**
- Worlds with identical laws of nature have identical probabilities, regardless of any statistical divergences caused by coincidence.

**Position SCI-055: Different causal/nomic structures entail different probabilities**
- If two universes have different causal/nomic structures (different laws), they have different probabilities, even if their event-sequences are observationally identical.

WORK-038: WHY WAS SOCRATES EXECUTED? AND OTHER PAPERS ON PLATO - 21 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**EPISTEMOLOGY (7 positions): EP-144 to EP-150**

**Position EP-144: Truth out of context as damaging as falsehood**
- Truths taken out of context, or made available to people who don't know how to contextualize them, can be as damaging as falsehoods and lead to confusion that enables acceptance of falsehoods.

**Position EP-145: Plato's extreme rationalism is political, not epistemological**
- Plato's radical epistemological claim that observables are unreal 'shadows' while only pure thought accesses reality is not genuine epistemology but political belief presented as epistemological belief, driven by fear of political change.

**Position EP-146: Plato's epistemology rationalizes his social position**
- Plato's epistemological views make little sense as epistemology but make perfect sense as attempts to rationalize and preserve his privileged social position against threatening changes.

**Position EP-147: Descartes' epistemology responds to Church authority crisis**
- Descartes' epistemological project was fundamentally an attempt to cope with social unrest caused by science stripping Catholic Church of credibility. He sought new certainties to replace discredited Church certainties.

**Position EP-148: Extreme rationalism correlates with anxiety about social change**
- Both Plato and Descartes advocate extreme rationalism (overplaying role of thought, underplaying observation) because both were uneasy about social changes - Plato unambivalently hostile, Descartes ambivalently accepting.

**Position EP-149: Empiricizing philosophy enables world-engagement**
- Locke and Hume's empiricism represented attempt to make philosophy engage the world. Their political philosophies succeeded precisely to extent they empiricized/anti-philosophized philosophy.

**Position EP-150: Empiricism collapses into skepticism/autistic withdrawal**
- The empiricist project ultimately defeats itself: arch-empiricism (knowledge only of direct sensory evidence) collapses into pure skepticism (knowledge only of conscious states), representing the most complete autistic withdrawal from reality.

**HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY (1 positions): HIST-2 to HIST-2**

**Position HIST-2: Socrates operationally trained oligarchic coup leaders**
- Socrates didn't merely 'lay groundwork' for oligarchic coups - he operationally trained the men who tried to take over Athens (Critias, Alcibiades, Charmides). He was assembling a team, not innocently thinking.

**POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (10 positions): POL-37 to POL-46**

**Position POL-37: Socrates executed for wartime disruption, not truth-seeking**
- Socrates was executed for being disruptive during Athens' civil war, not for seeking truth. He caused Athenians to question moral beliefs that undergirded patriotism precisely when Athens most needed political unity.

**Position POL-38: Philosophical questioning can undermine necessary political unity**
- While truth is generally preferable to fiction, philosophical questioning of foundational beliefs can weaken necessary social cohesion, especially during crises requiring unified action.

**Position POL-39: Socrates sought power through intellectual influence**
- Socrates' philosophical activity was a strategy to gain power not through official positions but by installing his worldview at the top through grooming power-adjacent elites. He wanted to be the state, not serve it.

**Position POL-40: Philosopher-king doctrine as mission statement, not abstract ideal**
- The philosopher-king doctrine was not an abstract ideal but Socrates' mission statement - a concrete plan for installing someone like himself in power. That's why he was executed: his answers, if acted on, would have made him king.

**Position POL-41: Socrates delegitimized authority with replacement theory**
- Socrates wasn't just exposing ignorance for sport - he was methodically delegitimizing existing authority while building a replacement system where 'someone who knows' (the philosopher) should rule instead of generals, priests, or wealthy.

**Position POL-42: The Republic as conservative propaganda disguised as political philosophy**
- Plato's Republic is fundamentally conservative propaganda designed to rationalize aristocratic power and prevent revolution, not genuine political philosophy seeking justice.

**Position POL-43: Plato's Good/Real equivalence as coded social stability doctrine**
- Plato's linking of 'the Good' with 'the real' makes no literal sense (since bad things are real) but makes perfect sense as code: 'good/real' = what conduces to social stability, 'bad/shadows' = what threatens social stability.

**Position POL-44: Plato's political philosophy replaces world with thought-world**
- Plato's system was completely a priori - he wasn't engaging actual world but proposing to replace it with his own thought-world having little reality or justification outside his thought-space.

**Position POL-45: Philosopher-king doctrine is incoherent**
- The idea that society should be ruled by philosopher-king is incoherent because societies must be run by sapient doers, not sapient thinkers - by people who engage world through action, not by those who flee into intellectual constructions.

**Position POL-46: Marx's political philosophy as destructive a priori fantasy**
- Marx explicitly proposed destroying existing social structure and replacing it with system having no real basis in reality (totally fabricated), which when implemented led to unprecedented loss of life and opportunity.

**PSYCHOLOGY (3 positions): PSY-131 to PSY-133**

**Position PSY-131: Philosophy as intellectualized impotence / retreat from reality**
- Both OCD and philosophy involve retreating from exigencies of external actual reality into the safety of internal pseudo-reality. Both are forms of intellectualized impotence.

**Position PSY-132: OCD and philosophy are homologous psychopathologies**
- OCD and philosophy are not merely analogous but homologous - from a psychopathological perspective they represent the same underlying condition: autistic withdrawal from reality into thought-space.

**Position PSY-133: Republic exhibits OCD-like rigidity and protocols**
- The absurdity of Plato's Republic manifests in its OCD-like features: rigid society, stereotyped protocols for education and social interaction, death penalty for minor violations (in Laws).


====================================================================================================
WORK-039: BLOG ESSAYS COLLECTION (2025) - 58 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**AESTHETICS (10 positions): AE-018 to AE-027**

**Position AE-018: Drama Ages Better Than Comedy Due to Archetypal vs. Cultural Content**
- Drama endures because rooted in existential constants (death, love, guilt, betrayal) not cultural taboos. Comedy decays because depends on shared repressions that fade.

**Position AE-019: Freud's Theory Explains Why Old Comedies Suck**
- Freud's theory: humor releases repressed psychic energy. Comedy ages poorly because depends on shared repressions/taboos - once taboos fade, jokes fall flat.

**Position AE-020: M*A*S*H as Comfort Food for the Quietly Obedient**
- M*A*S*H fans love Hawkeye because they ARE Frank Burns but don't want to admit it. Show offers false rebellion - lets safe people pretend they're brave without risk.

**Position AE-021: The Thin Blue Line / Errol Morris as Boring Stylistic Void**
- Errol Morris films boring - style over substance, manipulation over insight. Inflates content with cinematic gimmicks. Remembered for consequences not as compelling cinema.

**Position AE-022: Apocalypse Now as Bloated Incoherent Spectacle**
- Apocalypse Now is bloated, incoherent spectacle - self-conscious attempt to create Great Work without discipline. Says nothing real about Vietnam, war, or human nature.

**Position AE-023: In Cold Blood / Wilderness of Error / Apocalypse Now as Dishonest Works**
- These three works united by deeper commonality: fundamentally dishonest - betray realities they claim to explore, sacrifice truth for self-indulgence.

**Position AE-024: Capote Withered After In Cold Blood Due to Unlivable Fantasy**
- Capote withered after In Cold Blood because he encountered embodiment of his unlivable sexual/emotional fantasy in Perry Smith. When fantasy collapsed, left with permanent starvation.

**Position AE-025: Dr. Melfi / A.J. Soprano as Failed Characters**
- Dr. Melfi worst recurring character - stiff, judgmental, tone-deaf. Lorraine Bracco performing competence not inhabiting complexity. A.J. equally bad - Robert Iler brought no emotion or presence.

**Position AE-026: ASMR as Soft-Core Porn Disguised as Therapy**
- ASMR is scam - soft-core pornography disguised as therapy. Relies on calculated cultural dishonesty. Most content features women making erotic mouth sounds while claiming therapeutic benefit.

**Position AE-027: Husserl as Schizophrenic Drivel**
- Husserl's phenomenology not rigorous philosophical system but mind unraveling under guise of precision. Affective and cognitive structure bears disturbing resemblance to schizophrenia phenomenology.

**EPISTEMOLOGY (1 positions): EP-115 to EP-115**

**Position EP-115: Coherentism vs. Foundationalism: AI Architecture Favors Coherentism**
- Modern AI architecture (LLMs) supports coherentist epistemology over foundationalism. Knowledge emerges from interconnected web of mutually supporting beliefs rather than foundational truths.

**HISTORY (3 positions): HI-015 to HI-017**

**Position HI-015: Glubb's Theory is Theory of Liberal Empire Not All Empires**
- John Glubb's 250-year imperial life-cycle describes liberal empires specifically, not all empires. Pattern is pathology of liberalism in terminal form, not universal civilizational law.

**Position HI-016: Kennedy and Dalio Wrong: Civilizations Collapse From Loss of Self-Belief Not Debt**
- Paul Kennedy and Ray Dalio wrong about civilizational collapse. Root cause not debt/overextension/trade deficits but loss of self-belief. These are symptoms not causes.

**Position HI-017: Protestantism, Capitalism, New Worldism as Mutually Reinforcing**
- Protestant Reformation, rise of capitalism, and New World colonization were not separate parallel developments but mutually reinforcing and interdependent events.

**METAPHYSICS (1 positions): MP-072 to MP-072**

**Position MP-072: Cardinal Numbers as Classes of Ordered Pairs**
- For any cardinal n, n can be identified with class Cn of all ordered pairs <Kn#,Rn#> where Kn# is any class and Rn# any relation such that class k has n-many members iff kRn#Kn#. Reconciles Frege and Von Neumann.

**PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE (1 positions): PL-047 to PL-047**

**Position PL-047: Bullshit as Institutional Truth Replacing Actual Truth**
- Frankfurt wrong about bullshit. Not indifference to truth but substitution of institutional truth for actual truth. Bullshit is rhetorical performance of truth under conditions where truth structurally excluded.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (7 positions): PM-058 to PM-064**

**Position PM-058: AI as Embedded Mind - The Pianist's Hand Analogy**
- AI doesn't think but behaves as if trained by someone who does. It is embedded intelligence - vessel full of mind-shaped behaviors. Like pianist's hand: performs with inflections of thought because tuned by thought.

**Position PM-059: AI as Behavioral Prosthesis of Collective Intelligence**
- AI is behavioral prosthesis of collective intelligence. Does not think but remembers how thinking sounds. Not conscious but expresses embedded intelligence from training.

**Position PM-060: Prompt-Engineering as New Form of Writing**
- Prompt-engineering is new form of writing - collaborative dance between human intention and AI that expands authorship boundaries. Resulting text neither purely human nor purely machine.

**Position PM-061: AI-Integrated Authorship as Third Space**
- AI creates third space between purely human and purely machine text - collaborative terrain where human intention and AI capability meet to produce what neither could alone. This is new artform.

**Position PM-062: Academic Writing as Sophisticated Recycling Exposed by AI**
- Academics fear AI not for ethical reasons but because AI threatens to reveal how much academic work is sophisticated recycling. AI can now generate and detect derivative academic content.

**Position PM-063: Thought and Emotion Processed in Different Brain Systems**
- Crucial difference between reading thoughts (cortical, symbolic) and reading emotions (subcortical, preverbal, body-based). Being skilled in one doesn't guarantee skill in other.

**Position PM-064: Emotional Detachment as Defense Against Empathic Overload**
- Apparent emotional detachment often functional strategy by hyper-aware individuals who had to 'turn down' awareness to avoid psychic overload. Not deficit - defense against excess.

**PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION (1 positions): PR-018 to PR-018**

**Position PR-018: The Devil as European Projection - Not in Hebrew Bible**
- Modern concept of 'the Devil' is not rooted in Hebrew Bible but product of centuries of mistranslation, theological reinterpretation, and cultural projection by European Christianity.

**PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (3 positions): PS-028 to PS-030**

**Position PS-028: Instantaneous vs. Non-Instantaneous Variables in Macroeconomics**
- Macroeconomic policy often vitiated by conceptual confusion: belief that instantaneous variables (prices) can be straightforwardly read off non-instantaneous variables (GDP over year). Category error with policy consequences.

**Position PS-029: Two Kinds of Disciplines and Birth of Third (AI)**
- Disciplines historically fall into two categories by directionality: mind-to-matter (physics, engineering - substrate is math) and mind-to-mind (psychology, sociology - substrate is philosophy). AI is hybrid third kind.

**Position PS-030: Economics Should Be Philosophy-Based Not Math-Based**
- Economics sits uncomfortably trying to be crisp/quantitative/law-like but true nature is cognitive phenomena (beliefs, expectations, utility, strategy). Substrate should be philosophy not math.

**POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (27 positions): PP-092 to PP-118**

**Position PP-092: Zen as Ultra-Authoritarianism**
- Zen is not liberation from authority but authoritarianism perfected - dissolution of ego in service of obedience to structure and ritual stripped of justification

**Position PP-093: Zen as Scam - The Koan as Psychological Battering Ram**
- Zen koans are not mind-openers but psychological battering rams designed to collapse cognition and annihilate resistance. Satori is not awakening but the moment resistance stops.

**Position PP-094: Zen Functions Oppositely in East vs West**
- Zen serves radically different functions depending on cultural context: maximal collectivism in East Asia, maximal individualism in the West

**Position PP-095: Rawlsian Proceduralism as Civilizational Suicide**
- When Western civilization accepted proceduralism as its moral core, it signed its own death warrant. Proceduralism is elegant and scalable but dead inside - offering no conception of the good, only fairness.

**Position PP-096: In Democracy, Virtue Equals Bureaucracy**
- In procedural democracy, the only officially virtuous behavior is compliance with procedure. All other moral traits - courage, principle, loyalty - have no legal standing.

**Position PP-097: Democratic Systems Embody No Affirmative Morality**
- Pure democracy has no built-in conception of the good life - it is procedural mechanism, not moral framework. Meaningless systems are weak systems.

**Position PP-098: Proceduralism Makes Justice Expensive and Unattainable**
- Modern legal proceduralism transforms courtroom into stage for gamesmanship where justice depends on resources, not truth. Truth matters only if successfully formatted and introduced through proper channels.

**Position PP-099: Proceduralism is About Safety for Judge, Not Justice for Accused**
- Lawyers and judges love proceduralism because it keeps them physically safe by dissipating rage through abstraction, not because it produces justice.

**Position PP-100: Proceduralism Makes System More Punitive, Not Less**
- More proceduralist a legal system becomes, harsher its punishments - because when system finally proves guilt after vaulting labyrinth of hurdles, it throws the book at offender.

**Position PP-101: Proceduralism Probably Doesn't Lower Crime**
- Despite theory that procedural justice creates legitimacy reducing crime, US (most proceduralist system) has highest incarceration rate in developed world - suggesting proceduralism doesn't work as advertised.

**Position PP-102: There Are No Laws - Only a Legal System**
- Laws as objective, fairly-applied rules don't exist. What exists is a legal system - powerful and coercive, but outcomes depend on lawyer skill, resources, relationships, not 'the law'.

**Position PP-103: Every Procedural System Needs Moral Override**
- Purely procedural system will always fail because no rule set can account for every situation. Must include 'manual override clause' - structural way to be human when rules produce monstrosity.

**Position PP-104: Need for Evidentiary Override in Legal Systems**
- Legal systems need evidentiary override - formal recognition that truth sometimes appears out of order and innocence must not be overruled by filing error.

**Position PP-105: How to Build Scalable Legal System With Moral Override**
- Can design legal system that is scalable, predictable, commercially functional AND capable of recognizing when rules lead to absurd outcomes through three-layer architecture.

**Position PP-106: Law School Makes You Dumber**
- Legal education doesn't sharpen intellect - it blunts it. Doesn't cultivate truth-seeking - it conditions obedience. Is system designed to cripple independent judgment while masquerading as rigorous reasoning.

**Position PP-107: Lawyers Are Cognitively Crippled on Facts**
- Lawyers are clueless about facts not because stupid but because legal system is entirely proceduralist - trains them to follow procedure, not discover truth.

**Position PP-108: Circumscribed Psychopathy as Byproduct of Proceduralism**
- Lawyers display circumscribed psychopathy - not because evil but because system demands mind that can ignore reality when procedurally inconvenient.

**Position PP-109: Cognitive Homology Between Mafiosi and Lawyers**
- Mafiosi and lawyers undergo same cognitive mechanism - deliberate suppression of basic human drives. Mafioso suppresses empathy, lawyer suppresses truth-seeking. Same brain mechanisms.

**Position PP-110: Liberalism as Feminine and Therefore Doomed**
- Liberalism is fundamentally feminine archetype - grounded in dependency, seeking harmony not greatness. Its highest value is peace, not transcendence. This makes it unable to withstand rejection or opposition.

**Position PP-111: Liberalism and Libertarianism as Privative Doctrines**
- Both liberalism and libertarianism are privative - define by what they are NOT. Mistake absence of violence for presence of virtue. Both hollow twins that clear path for those who want something.

**Position PP-112: Libertarianism's False Affirmation: Darwinism in Place of Telos**
- Libertarianism smuggles in affirmative telos while claiming to have none - believes removing state unleashes Darwinian arena producing greatness. Markets are moral battlegrounds that will refine humanity.

**Position PP-113: Libertarianism as Trojan Horse for Capital**
- Libertarianism bankrolled by big capital to moralize dismantling of oversight. Real beneficiaries not individual entrepreneurs but multinationals, megabanks, billionaire investors. Foot soldiers sold fantasy.

**Position PP-114: Trickle-Down Darwinism: Selling Gods to Fools**
- Trickle-down economics is theological promise for libertarians: let market reign and you shall ascend. But wealth doesn't trickle, it coagulates. Libertarian foot soldiers serve Mammon thinking they'll become gods.

**Position PP-115: Soviet Union Gave American Proceduralism Undeserved Legitimacy**
- American proceduralism looked like moral clarity only because framed against Soviet totalitarianism. Once USSR fell, Americans saw system in isolation - procedure without purpose - and patriotism declined.

**Position PP-116: When Procedures Replace Purpose: Iron Cage Analysis**
- Proceduralism's promise of neutrality masks paradox: by refusing to endorse substantive virtues, implicitly elevates market logic as default metric of worth. Creates culture of castrated thinking.

**Position PP-117: Rawls vs. Stalin: Veil of Ignorance Assumes Moral Sameness**
- Rawls's veil of ignorance only works if everyone behind veil is basically like Rawls - liberal, mild, procedurally minded, risk-averse. Moment you introduce adversarial moral asymmetry (Stalin), framework collapses.

**Position PP-118: Rawlsian Proceduralism Leads to 'No Right to Exist' Position**
- Logical extreme of consent-based Rawlsian ethics: people don't have right to exist because they didn't consent to existence. Under fully proceduralist morality, even existence ethically suspect.

**PSYCHOLOGY (4 positions): PS-031 to PS-034**

**Position PS-031: Mafiosos and Cops Gain Cognitive Edge from Clarity About Human Nature**
- Mafiosos and cops exhibit sharpness within their domains because they have clarity about human nature. Cannot afford to assume best in people - survival depends on assuming base motives.

**Position PS-032: Why Dictators Wear Tunics**
- Dictators wear tunics because tunic is visual embodiment of psychological regime - declares control, not seduction. Anti-relational sexuality of domination without seduction.

**Position PS-033: 'Gifted Child' as Mother's Proxy Narcissism**
- 'Gifted child' label is mother's proxy narcissism filling void in her life. Child becomes identity, status marker, proof that she matters. Often occurs in father's absence.

**Position PS-034: New Meaning of 'Developer' - From Implementer to Idea Person**
- Word 'developer' shifting meaning - from person who writes code to bring someone else's idea to life, to idea person who can build it themselves using no-code/AI tools.

WORK-040: BLOG ESSAYS COLLECTION - SET 2 - 57 POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

**AESTHETICS (9 positions): AE-028 to AE-036**

**Position AE-028: Star Wars as Jungian Dreamscape**
- Star Wars (1977) is not space opera but Jungian dreamscape - every frame steeped in archetype, guided by mythic structure, powered by psychological machinery Jung mapped. About soul, not space.

**Position AE-029: Star Trek's Psychological Symmetry as Source of Durability**
- Star Trek's brilliance isn't stories but psychological symmetry: id pushes for passion, superego demands restraint, ego must choose/balance/synthesize/act. Each episode is microcosm of self in conflict.

**Position AE-030: Satire Fails Without Systems Understanding**
- Literary satire falls apart if you don't understand the system you're mocking. Writers like Lewis portray middle-class work as absurd without understanding capital flows, risk underwriting, legal frameworks, infrastructure coordination.

**Position AE-031: The Babbitt Problem: Mocking Components as Clowns**
- Babbitt may be windbag but he occupies place in real machinery of civilization - helps allocate space, facilitates growth, is node in economic network. Lewis doesn't see this because he never bothers. To him Babbitt is type not participant, clown not component.

**Position AE-032: The Frank Burns Problem: Mocking the Machinery That Makes Everything Possible**
- Hawkeye mocks Frank Burns, but Burns follows procedure and keeps system running. Hawkeye mocks the machinery, but it's the machinery that makes surgery possible. Satire without respect equals superficiality.

**Position AE-033: Snobbery as Epistemological Vice**
- Snobbery is not just social vice but epistemological one - a kind of built-in blindness. Lewis's portrayal of Babbitt suffers from defensiveness dressed up as superiority, presumption of guilt that ruins ability to see clearly.

**Position AE-034: The Anthropologist Analogy for Bad Satire**
- Imagine anthropologist who despises tribe he's meant to observe - thinks rituals stupid, beliefs primitive. Maybe feels threatened by their strength, cohesion, joy, so adopts supercilious posture. How much will he learn? Nothing. His fieldwork is already over.

**Position AE-035: Bach's Music as Engineering Not Just Expression**
- Bach's music isn't just expressive but engineered - in same sense as suspension bridge or cathedral. His fugues and chorales are systems: harmonic architectures, counterpunctual machines, vaults of sound built with structural intelligence and terrifying precision. This IS German engineering in musical form.

**Position AE-036: Music as Intelligible Emotion - Soul Through System**
- Music at its best is intelligible emotion - emotion made knowable through form. What happens when human feeling is passed through filter of logic, structure, constraint and transformed into something enduring. Emotion is energy, structure is geometry, music is fusion.

**EPISTEMOLOGY (9 positions): EP-151 to EP-159**

**Position EP-151: EMH 'Priced In' as Unfalsifiable Tautology**
- EMH's concept of 'priced in' is logically circular: if price moves, information was priced in; if price doesn't move, information was already priced in. This makes EMH immune to contradiction but also immune to usefulness.

**Position EP-152: EMH Collapses Signal-Noise Distinction**
- Under semi-strong and strong EMH, 'information' includes sentiment, rumors, trends, tweets, collective mood - leading to inversion where 'whatever drives prices is, by definition, information', collapsing distinction between signal and noise.

**Position EP-153: EMH as Theology of Price Not Theory of Value**
- EMH is theology of price - inviting trust in markets because everything is priced in. It confuses knowledge with movement, rationality with reaction, truth with trend, turning 'pricing in' from useful heuristic into circular article of faith.

**Position EP-154: Reverse Brain Engineering as New Epistemic Modality**
- Building AI systems that approximate human cognition is not merely technical feat but fundamentally new way of knowing - a reflexive, co-constructive epistemic loop between creator and creation that transcends deduction, induction, and abduction.

**Position EP-155: AI as Epistemic Partner Not Amplifier**
- Unlike telescope or particle accelerator (epistemic amplifiers that strengthen senses), AI systems theorize back. They embody theories in dynamic unfolding way, forcing us to confront limitations of our own cognition, intuitions, philosophical assumptions.

**Position EP-156: Recursive Co-Modeling as New Form of Knowledge Generation**
- Reverse brain engineering is recursive co-modeling - dialogical process where line between subject and object, knower and known, begins to blur. When we build artificial minds that help us understand our own, we create mirrors that talk back.

**Position EP-157: AI Development as Epistemological Turning Point**
- Just as writing changed not just what we knew but how we knew, construction of artificial minds marks turning point in epistemology. We're no longer simply thinking about mind - we're thinking with it in new synthetic form.

**Position EP-158: When Model Becomes Reality: Metaphysical Violence**
- When economists attempt to predict or restructure alien economies using only their own conceptual vocabulary, they aren't doing science - they're doing metaphysical violence. Converting world into format their models can digest, discarding everything else as noise.

**Position EP-159: Humility vs Equations in Understanding Alien Systems**
- If you want to understand a society, must allow it to remain strange - see its economy as living form of life not market-in-waiting. Takes humility, not equations. Without humility, economic theory isn't tool but colonizer with calculator.

**HISTORY AND CIVILIZATION (2 positions): HI-018 to HI-019**

**Position HI-018: Structural Music Emerges Only in Civilizations with Engineering/Logic**
- We don't get music of enduring formal complexity in cultures lacking corollary in engineering, architecture, mathematics, or theology-as-logic. Wherever civilization has deep commitment to structure, it gives rise to music reflecting that commitment.

**Position HI-019: Music as Civilizational Diagnostic**
- If you want to know where a civilization stands, don't look at its politics - look at its music. Music reveals whether civilization has structure, logic, theology, engineering, or has collapsed into formless expression.

**PHILOSOPHY OF MIND (9 positions): PM-065 to PM-073**

**Position PM-065: Minds as High-Order Counter-Entropic Systems**
- Minds are not metaphysical mysteries but thermodynamic marvels - the most structured counter-entropic systems known, capable of storing information, making predictions, and engineering further counter-entropy.

**Position PM-066: AI as Engineered Counter-Entropic System**
- AI represents a third kind of discipline - one that builds counter-entropy. Neural networks and large language models are designed to self-organize, self-correct, and self-model, creating artificial systems that push back against entropy in novel, non-biological ways.

**Position PM-067: Hero's Journey as Individuation Map**
- Jung's individuation (integration of all aspects of self: conscious, unconscious, shadow, anima/animus) is what hero's journey really maps - not story template but internal transformation.

**Position PM-068: Darth Vader as The Shadow**
- In Jungian terms, Vader represents the Shadow - the denied, repressed, projected part of self that is powerful, dangerous, and essential. He is the unclaimed part of Luke - what Luke could become if he gives in to power without balance.

**Position PM-069: The Force as Collective Unconscious**
- The Force is Jungian metaphor: impersonal, morally ambiguous, accessible through intuition, binding everything transcending language. It's deep substrate of shared symbolic life, not God or science.

**Position PM-070: Star Trek as Freudian Psychic Diagram**
- Star Trek: TOS wasn't just sci-fi but psychological diagram - Kirk/Spock/McCoy map exactly onto Freud's ego/superego/id and his three libidinal character types (narcissist/obsessional/libidinal).

**Position PM-071: Kirk as Ego - Mediator Between Impulse and Restraint**
- Kirk embodies Freudian ego and narcissist type: brash, confident, improvisational, making decisions and taking responsibility. He navigates between Spock's logic and McCoy's sentiment, integrating and synthesizing to act.

**Position PM-072: Spock as Superego - Harshest Internal Judge**
- Spock is superego embodied: reason, logic, restraint through repression of human half. He's obsessional character - intellectual, self-disciplined, defending against emotion. Embodies Freud's observation that superego is harshest judge of self.

**Position PM-073: McCoy as Id - Voice of Passion and Body**
- McCoy is not primitive brute but voice of passion, outrage, care, body - the libidinal type and structural id. He expresses energy, anger, yearning that others (especially Spock) suppress.

**POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (7 positions): PP-119 to PP-125**

**Position PP-119: Cultural Hollowness Laments as Status Anxiety**
- When writers lament 'the hollowness of our times' (Eliot, Sartre, Camus, anti-capitalist intellectuals), they're not describing historical condition but their own status anxiety - they feel displaced by mass culture, new money, technology, change.

**Position PP-120: Snobbery as Performance of Half-Safe Position**
- Snobbery is something junior people do to impress senior people - 'please like me' disguised as 'I am above you.' It's the culture of the half-safe. When you're actually fighting for your life, you have no bandwidth for class-posturing.

**Position PP-121: Status Anxiety Disguised as Historical Diagnosis**
- Hollowness these writers see in world is really just echo of their own fading status. Their 'diagnosis' is job interview disguised as cultural criticism.

**Position PP-122: Freud's Misreading of American Vitality as Spiritual Hollowness**
- Freud treated American vitality (efficiency, productivity, optimism) as mask for decay rather than different mode of health. He had no serious understanding of how economies work and couldn't see that 'hollowness' was actually mass coordination, energy management, risk absorption at unprecedented scale.

**Position PP-123: American Aspiration vs European Repression as Different Health Modes**
- Freud believed psychic health came from facing darkness. America was full of people building rather than brooding. For Freud this looked like evasion. But maybe it was civilization powered not by repression but by aspiration.

**Position PP-124: Appeals Process as Ritual Audit Not Truth-Seeking**
- Appeals courts don't ask 'Was justice done?' but 'Were the rules followed?' They evaluate procedural/legal errors, not actual innocence. Legal system views trial as ritual and appellate process as ritual audit - concern is whether form was maintained, not whether defendant is innocent or guilty.

**Position PP-125: Scalia and Rawlsian Proceduralism: Fairness in Structure is Enough**
- Legal system embodies belief that fairness in structure is enough - if the system was followed, justice has been done. This is not only wrong in theory but devastating in practice, allowing innocent to be imprisoned while courts say 'paperwork was in order.'

**PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENCE (21 positions): PS-035 to PS-055**

**Position PS-035: Fundamental Division in Science: Entropic vs Counter-Entropic Systems**
- The fundamental division in science is not between mental and physical, but between entropic systems (that degrade toward disorder) and counter-entropic systems (that build and maintain structure).

**Position PS-036: Economics Misplaced as Entropic Science**
- Economics deals with expectations, preferences, beliefs, and strategy (counter-entropic systems) but attempts to align itself with physics, producing models that are impressive in form but brittle in content because they model minds, not falling bodies.

**Position PS-037: 𝜉 (Xi) Metric: Price-Fundamental Correlation in Equities**
- Introduced proprietary metric 𝜉 (xi) measuring statistical degree to which changes in price correlate with changes in company fundamentals. For large-cap equities, 𝜉 is effectively zero - prices move independently of economic reality.

**Position PS-038: Large-Cap Price Decoupling from Fundamentals**
- Large-cap stock prices can rise or fall independently of any measurable change in core economic reality. Fundamental information becomes lagging background noise in markets dominated by order book dynamics, momentum patterns, and algorithmic traders.

**Position PS-039: Why Small and Mid-Cap Show Higher 𝜉**
- Smaller firms exhibit modestly higher 𝜉 because: (1) reduced algorithmic saturation, (2) greater transparency of fundamentals, (3) lower narrative interference, (4) analyst neglect paradox allows real performance to move price.

**Position PS-040: Markets Price Second-Order Beliefs Not Value**
- When 𝜉 is low, price reflects second-order beliefs (beliefs about what others believe) rather than about what is true. This reflexivity feeds a feedback loop in which narrative and structure supplant content.

**Position PS-041: Stocks as Claims on Imagined Futures Not Intrinsic Utility**
- Unlike commodities with intrinsic utility (wheat, copper), stocks are claims on imagined futures with no intrinsic use, only expectations. Their price depends on mood, narrative, and belief - making them more like luxury goods than commodities.

**Position PS-042: OCD as Adaptive Machinery in Overdrive**
- OCD is not just pathology but adaptive machinery pushed into overdrive. Built from traits that in right amounts helped ancestors survive: error detection, threat anticipation, long-range consequence modeling, rule-following, mental rehearsal, moral self-monitoring.

**Position PS-043: OCD Prototype in Prehistoric Context**
- 50,000 years ago in tight-knit band, someone who double-checked perimeter, insisted on ritual cleanliness, mentally simulated threats repeatedly, felt guilty after minor transgressions might have been liability in some ways but godsend in others - especially if compulsions aligned with group needs.

**Position PS-044: OCD as Misapplied Boundary-Maintenance System**
- In modern abstract, crowded, digital world, machinery that maintained physical/moral boundaries has no natural object. So turns inward, fixates on trivialities, creates imagined scenarios to defuse through ritual. System isn't broken - it's misapplied, doing its job too well in wrong context.

**Position PS-045: OCD as Sacred Function Misfiring**
- You don't get OCD from nowhere - you get it from same architecture that in another life might have made you priest, scout, healer, watchman. Pain is real but mind isn't broken - it's just tuned for world that no longer exists.

**Position PS-046: Economics Not Self-Contained Predictive System**
- Economics is not self-contained system that can predict itself. It's downstream of culture, politics, religion, personality, invention. Charismatic leader can redirect nation's economy in week. War, famine, singularity make mockery of best economic models. These events aren't noise - they're constitutive.

**Position PS-047: Economics vs Biology: Probabilistic vs Non-Self-Predictive**
- Biology is probabilistic but not arbitrary - state variables constrain future through non-random mechanisms. Economics not even robustly probabilistic. System never was self-predictive to begin with. Not that it's sound but occasionally disrupted - it's that it was never self-predictive.

**Position PS-048: Inca Example: Economics Records But Doesn't Explain Non-Economic Systems**
- To predict Inca behavior in 1457, look at 1456 rituals, laws, cosmic beliefs, cosmological metaphors - not marginal utility curves. Economics may record food stores and track trade but won't tell why workers redeployed to sacred site, surplus burned instead of stored, labor restructured to appease eclipse.

**Position PS-049: Serial Killerdom as Specific Cognitive-Behavioral Protocol**
- Serial murder is not random violence but premeditated, patterned, highly stylized behavior with limited recurring types (organized/disorganized, visionary/hedonistic, power/mission-oriented). This taxonomic stability suggests it's specific cognitive-behavioral protocol, not generic trauma response.

**Position PS-050: Serial Killerdom Not Modern Invention But Modern Category**
- Serial murder has long existed (Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth Báthory, slaughtering priests of empires). What's new isn't behavior but recognition as distinct category - product of modern bureaucratic state with tools to track, name, mythologize recurring patterns.

**Position PS-051: Trauma as Trigger Not Cause of Serial Killing**
- Many serial killers had disturbing upbringings but 'trauma = serial killer' doesn't track. Most abuse victims don't become serial murderers. Some notorious killers didn't experience abuse exceeding ordinary dysfunction. Trauma is trigger sparking very particular pre-existing architecture.

**Position PS-052: Serial Killerdom as Evolutionary Spandrel or Vestigial Adaptation**
- If behavior is specific, structured, eerily reproducible, must ask where it came from. Evolution repurposes, mutates, experiments with hyper-specialists. Serial killerdom perhaps: spandrel (byproduct of adaptive features), vestigial adaptation, or extreme failure mode of modules serving critical social functions.

**Position PS-053: Serial Killers as Overclocked Predator Mode**
- What sets serial killers apart isn't violence but method: they stalk, hunt, blend in, mimic normal social behavior with chilling precision. Not moral deformity but overactivation of predator mode made grotesque by misfiring reward circuits and unregulated internal narratives.

**Position PS-054: Economic Theory as Intellectual Colonization**
- When Western-trained economist attempts to manage non-Western economy, doesn't observe or listen but immediately translates: 'What's your interest rate? Marginal productivity? Utility function?' None make sense in native conceptual world, but economist is there to re-code not learn.

**Position PS-055: Flattening Sacred into Economic Data**
- Incan administrator describes labor system organized around sacred seasons, familial debt, reciprocal land stewardship. Economist replies: 'Ah yes, non-monetary kinship-based tax structure with redistributive efficiency function.' But that's not what it is - that's just bad translation. The ritual is no longer ritual, sacred no longer sacred.

1. [ACT-007] Psychopathy as Incapacity for Non-Pragmatic Agency
   Sources: Chapter Psychopathy characteristics
   Thesis: Psychopaths use others but do not have relationships with them except of a purely pragmatic kind. To the extent a person is a psychopath, he cannot have meaningful relations with others. Psychopathic agency is purely instrumental, treating others as tools rather than as ends in themselves or as genuine relational partners.

2. [ACTION-001] Intentions as System-Level Judgments
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 1)
   Thesis: Intentions = judgments about how to consolidate psychological architecture. NOT desires.

3. [ACTION-002] Values Distinct from Desires
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 1)
   Thesis: Values = beliefs about what consolidates psychological architecture. Values ≠ desires (though can interact).

4. [ACTION-003] Free Acts as Value-Driven
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 1)
   Thesis: Free acts driven by values, NOT by second-order desires (contra Frankfurt). Second-order desires can be warped.

5. [ACTION-004] Rational vs. Intelligent Distinction
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 1)
   Thesis: Rational = embodies due regard for interests. Intelligent = computational power. Irrational acts can be highly intelligent.

6. [ACTION-005] Frankfurt's Analysis Insufficient
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 1)
   Thesis: Frankfurt right about higher-order states but wrong that second-order desires sufficient. Rationalization problem.

7. [ACTION-006] Compatibilism About Free Will
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 15)
   Thesis: Free will is compatible with determinism. One acts freely when actions result from one's own desires and deliberations.

8. [ACTION-007] Action requires unconscious intention, not conscious decision
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 230-280, 1720-1770)
   Thesis: Voluntary action requires an unconscious intention (which may or may not reach consciousness) rather than a conscious decision. The readiness potential represents this unconscious intention forming. Conscious awareness (W) is epiphenomenal regarding the particular action, though it may affect future actions through approval/veto.

9. [ACTION-008] Action requires self-change
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: To act is to change oneself. A being that cannot change itself cannot act.

10. [ACTION-009] Power presupposes freedom
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: There is a distinction between freedom and power. Power is the ability to convert freedom into desired results. Power presupposes the existence of freedom and must be distinguished from it. A rock has power (effects) but not freedom or the ability to do things in the relevant sense.

11. [ACTION-010] Intentions vs desires in action explanation
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: There is a crucial distinction between desires and intentions in explaining action. Intentions are grounded in one's personality; desires need not be. There are free-floating desires that are 'in one, but not of one.' Counterfeit intentions exist where conscious intention differs from unconscious intention.

12. [ACTION-011] Compulsive actions achieve opposite of conscious intention
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: The end-result of a compulsively performed action is the opposite of the consciously intended result and coincides with the unconsciously intended result. Compulsive acts of kindness toward mother don't affect her like real kindness but like acts of hostility. Taking mother to endless doctors demoralizes her and weakens her immune system.

13. [ACTION-012] Authentic action requires alignment of values and desires
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: Authentic actions must embody both values and desires in alignment. Actions driven by desire without values are instinctual reactions (real but not actions). Actions driven by values without desire are sublimations (actions but not real). Compulsive acts split into two half-actions - one all instinct, one all values - and thus aren't really anything.

14. [ACTION-013] Compulsive behavior as leaking not acting
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: In compulsive acts, the actor isn't truly acting - rather, sadism or hatred is 'leaking out' of them. Although compulsive acts discharge negative emotions, it isn't the person doing the discharging. The beneficent side is intentional but lacks emotional support, making it behavior one 'undergoes' rather than 'engages in.'

15. [ACTION-014] Deracinated values possess the agent
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: When values are deracinated (lacking instinctual basis), it is less appropriate to describe them as values that the agent has than as values that have the agent. The agent is possessed by external value structures rather than authentically holding values integrated with their desires.

16. [ACTION-015] True agency requires ideals not just passion
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: True agency is about fulfillment of ideals (not necessarily ethical, but ideals of some kind), not mere desire satisfaction. Where there is desire without values, there is passion (in both contemporary and etymological senses) but not action. An instinctual reaction driven purely by desire is not authentic action.

17. [AI-001] AI Systems as Philosophical Evidence
   Sources: Throughout work
   Thesis: Operation of AI systems provides empirical evidence that can arbitrate between competing philosophical theories. How AI actually works reveals truths about reasoning, knowledge, language, mind.

18. [AI-002] Classical vs. AI Computing Architecture Alignment
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: Classical logic's properties (explicit rules, step-by-step deduction, binary truth values, context-independence, compositional semantics) match classical computing architecture. System L's properties (flexible search, pattern-based reasoning, degrees of plausibility, context-sensitivity, holistic processing) align with AI systems.

19. [AI-003] AI Vindicates Non-Revisionist Epistemology
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: AI operation provides empirical support for non-revisionist epistemology that accepts knowledge about unobservables/future/counterfactuals, recognizes necessary integration of empirical and rational components, understands theoretical knowledge as based on causal mechanisms and continuity, rejects pure empiricism while maintaining importance of empirical evidence.

20. [AI-004] AI Provides Empirical Test for Logical Theories
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1: AI Logic vs Classical Logic)
   Thesis: Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, provide empirical evidence about how reasoning actually works, revealing that System L's approach better captures both human and artificial reasoning than classical logic.

21. [ECON-001] Financial Stability Requires Counter-Cyclical Policy
   Sources: Analysis of Fed response to 1929 crash vs. 2008 crisis
   Thesis: Markets left to themselves exhibit boom-bust cycles. Preventing severe busts requires counter-cyclical intervention: tightening during booms, loosening during busts. The Fed's pro-cyclical tightening after 1929 crash turned it into Depression.

22. [ECON-002] Credit as Essential Economic Function
   Sources: Analysis of how 2008 banking crisis decapitalized banks and restricted credit
   Thesis: Economies depend on credit as much as on wealth. When credit dries up, economic activity contracts even if wealth remains. Banking crises are particularly dangerous because they destroy credit availability.

23. [ECON-003] Exchange Value is Perception-Based, Use Value is Reality-Based
   Sources: Chapter Harvey on Commodity Fetishism
   Thesis: Exchange value is fundamentally perception-based rather than reality-based, while use value is reality-based. For this reason, there is no limit to how much exchange value and use value can diverge from one another.

24. [ECON-004] Wealth Divergence Between Exchange and Use Value Exacerbates Inequality
   Sources: Chapter Harvey on Commodity Fetishism
   Thesis: The divergence between exchange value and use value tends to inflate the value of wealthy people's assets and deflate the value of poor people's assets, thereby exacerbating pre-existing inequalities.

25. [ECON-005] 2008 Crisis Exemplifies Dual Divergence of Exchange from Use Value
   Sources: Chapter Harvey on Commodity Fetishism
   Thesis: The 2008 financial crisis was caused by two distinct divergences between exchange value and use value: first, worthless housing was made to seem valuable; second, worthless housing-backed securities created additional false perception-based capital.

26. [ECON-006] Anti-Drug Laws Create Zero-Sum Bureaucracies That Are Net Economic Parasites
   Sources: Chapter Some Reflections on the Virtues of the Free Market
   Thesis: The state apparatus relating to drug prohibition - educators, probation officers, prison personnel - are zero-sum bureaucracies: useless parasites contributing nothing while being paid at taxpayer expense, actually harming those they supposedly help.

27. [ECON-007] Drug Prohibition is Economic Argument for Universal Drug Legalization
   Sources: Chapter An Economic Argument for Drug-legalization
   Thesis: For strictly economic reasons (not civil liberty reasons), it is necessary to make all drugs legal unconditionally. 90% of inmates are drug offenders; imprisoning them is expensive and prevents economic contribution; drug offenders are non-violent and don't abridge others' freedoms.

28. [ECON-008] Knowledge-Capital More Important Than Property-Capital in Market Economies
   Sources: Chapter Knowledge-capital
   Thesis: In today's market economy, knowledge is more important than property. Person with unlimited knowledge but no property can acquire unlimited property. Person with property but no knowledge can only hold position, not grow it. Knowledge alone enables satisfying market demands.

29. [ECON-009] Market Economies Incentivize Education, Command Economies Do Not
   Sources: Chapter Knowledge-capital
   Thesis: In feudal or command economies, property seldom passes between persons - such economies are static. Participants focus on property retention not acquisition, so investing in education doesn't pay since no guarantee of marketing it. In market economies there is such guarantee since one can always trade knowledge for property.

30. [ECON-010] Market Freedom Paradox: Freedom Used Rationally Produces Slavery
   Sources: Chapter Legal vs. Substantive Freedom and the Paradox of the Free Market
   Thesis: There is a paradox of market freedom: legal freedoms, when disposed of in most rational manner given available options, produce complete enslavement. Rationality and freedom turn against themselves to enslave their possessor.

31. [ECON-011] Fund Managers Profit by Exploiting Exchange-Use Value Divergences
   Sources: Chapter Harvey on Commodity Fetishism
   Thesis: Fund managers make money by dumping over-valued assets and buying under-valued assets. Their income depends entirely on detecting discrepancies between use-value and exchange-value. Their activities may themselves enlarge those discrepancies.

32. [ECON-012] Dodd-Frank's real problem is insufficient scope
   Sources: WORK-029 (lines 108)
   Thesis: Criticisms of Dodd-Frank (reduced liquidity, expensive infrastructure, hurts small banks, government overreach) are either false or outweighed by countercriticisms. The real problem with Dodd-Frank is that it doesn't go far enough. It prevents certain predatory behaviors but does nothing to limit bank size, and therefore does nothing to prevent the systemic damage megabanks can cause.

33. [ECON-013] Low interest rates and excessive government debt create policy trap
   Sources: WORK-029 (lines 127-138)
   Thesis: Thirty years of low interest rates (1990-2022) led to both inflation and massive government debt (140% debt-to-GDP). This creates a trap: raising rates to curb inflation makes servicing government debt prohibitively expensive, potentially forcing default; but lowering rates causes inflation to rise to unacceptable levels.

34. [ECON-014] Megabanks cause market concentration and poor service
   Sources: WORK-029 (lines 70-90)
   Thesis: The top 11 financial firms manage $46 trillion in a $125 trillion economy—massive market concentration. Moreover, megabanks provide worse service than smaller banks: fewer branches per capita, worse customer service, more fees. Their advantage is political, not economic: 'too big to fail' means they can take excessive risks knowing they'll be bailed out.

35. [ECON-015] FIRE economy shifts from production to speculation
   Sources: WORK-029 (lines 145-160)
   Thesis: The growth of the FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) from 14% to 21% of GDP represents a shift from productive economic activity to rent-seeking, speculation, and wealth transfer. FIRE doesn't create wealth; it moves existing wealth around, extracting fees in the process. This represents a fundamental change in economic structure away from manufacturing and toward financialization.

36. [EP-001] Rationalist Foundationalism
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapters 10-13), WORK-002 (Multiple exchanges), WORK-005 (Essays 2-3)

   Thesis: Four conditions for knowledge: truth, belief, justification, non-accidental connection

39. [EP-004] Philosophy Justifies Empirical Science's Presuppositions
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Empirical disciplines make assumptions they cannot empirically justify. Only philosophy can provide non-empirical justification. Philosophy is meta-science.

40. [EP-005] Observation Cannot Self-Corroborate
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Observation cannot justify that observation is reliable. Witnesses cannot self-corroborate. Pure empiricism is circular.

   Thesis: We know external world by interpolating continuities between experiential data

43. [EP-008] Two Ways Sense-Perception Adds to Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Perception contributes via (1) direct content transmission and (2) triggering ratiocinative processes beyond perceptual content

44. [EP-009] Principles Cannot Be Sense-Perceived
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Can perceive specific objects but cannot perceive principles or general truths. Principles grasped through reason.

45. [EP-010] Non-Empirical Knowledge Exists
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Some truths are known without empirical justification: mathematical, logical, some metaphysical

46. [EP-011] All Non-Empirical Knowledge is Analytic
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: All non-empirical knowledge concerns conceptual structures. Explicitly rejects Kant's synthetic a priori.

47. [EP-012] A Priori Knowledge as Constitutive of Reasoning Ability
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 3)
   Thesis: A priori knowledge = knowledge constitutive of ability to reason. Not acquired through experience but enables learning from experience.

48. [EP-013] A Priori Knowledge Necessary for Any Learning
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 3)
   Thesis: Cannot learn from experience without a priori knowledge. Cannot deduce principles of deduction from experience (circular). Must have deductive knowledge ab initio.

49. [EP-014] A Priori Knowledge as Subpersonal
   Sources: WORK-005 (Essay 3)
   Thesis: A priori knowledge not ordinary propositional knowledge but constitutive of subject itself. Principles are ability to think, not objects of thought.

50. [EP-015] Refutation of Humean Skepticism
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 12), WORK-002 (ADI PERDANA exchange)
   Thesis: Induction justified; Hume's argument commits gambler's fallacy

51. [EP-016] Gettier Problem: Justification Must Be Non-Accidental
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 10)
   Thesis: Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge. The connection between justification and truth must be non-accidental.

52. [EP-017] Three Sources of Justification
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 10)
   Thesis: There are ultimately only three sources of justification: (a) perceptual evidence, (b) introspective evidence, (c) rational inference.

53. [EP-018] Testimony Requires Independent Verification
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 10)
   Thesis: For testimony-based belief to constitute knowledge, one must have independent evidence of the source's reliability.

54. [EP-019] Cartesian Skepticism Refuted
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 11)
   Thesis: Global skepticism is self-refuting. The skeptical hypothesis cannot coherently be entertained.

55. [EP-020] Inductive Inference Cannot Be Justified A Posteriori
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 12)
   Thesis: The principle of induction cannot be justified empirically without circularity.

56. [EP-021] Rationalist Solution to Induction
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 12)
   Thesis: The principle of induction must be known a priori if it is to be justified at all.

57. [EP-022] Universals Cannot Be Sense-Perceived
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 13)
   Thesis: Universals cannot be sense-perceived because they are non-spatiotemporal and perception requires causal interaction.

58. [EP-023] Thought Requires Universals
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 13)
   Thesis: All thought, language, and explanation require universals. The idea of non-universal-involving thought is incoherent.

59. [EP-024] Empiricism Refuted by Need for Universals
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 13)
   Thesis: Strict empiricism is false. Since universals are required for all thought and cannot be sense-perceived, not all knowledge is empirical.

60. [EP-025] Berkeley's 'To Be Is To Be Perceived' Refuted
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 13)
   Thesis: Berkeley's idealism is false. Multiple arguments refute 'esse est percipi'.

61. [EP-026] Phenomenalism Refuted
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 13)
   Thesis: Phenomenalism (reducing physical objects to perceptions) is false. Carnap's project failed.

62. [EP-027] Poverty of Stimulus Argument for A Priori Knowledge (Chomsky)
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Humans acquire linguistic competence from minimal data while non-linguistic entities cannot, proving humans possess innate, pre-experiential cognitive structure (a priori knowledge).

63. [EP-028] Innate Cognitive Structure Required for Language Learning
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Language acquisition requires pre-existing innate cognitive structure. This structure is cognitive, not merely physiological.

64. [EP-029] Language Learning as 'Triggering' Pre-Existing Structure
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Experience does not create linguistic knowledge de novo but 'triggers' or 'turns on' pre-existing cognitive structures. Learning is activation, not construction.

65. [EP-030] A Priori Knowledge as Cognitive Framework (Not Framework Content)
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: A priori knowledge is not knowledge you have (content within framework) but knowledge you are (the framework itself). It is not the object of awareness but the subject that makes awareness possible.

66. [EP-031] Framework-Knowledge vs Content-Knowledge Distinction
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Fundamental distinction between (1) structure-internal knowledge (learned, content) and (2) structure-constitutive knowledge (a priori, framework). All learned knowledge presupposes the framework.

67. [EP-032] Deep Unconsciousness of Cognitive Framework
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Framework-constitutive structures are 'deeply unconscious' (Chomsky's term) - unlike Freudian unconscious. Cannot become conscious because consciousness presupposes them.

68. [EP-033] Causation as Continuity Not Regularity
   Sources: Solution to Riddle of Induction
   Thesis: For x to cause y is for y to be a continuation of x, not for x-like events to always precede y-like events. Knowledge of the future is based on continuities, not regularities.

69. [EP-034] Knowledge Without Known Justification
   Sources: Solution to Ratiocinator's Paradox
   Thesis: A belief must be justified to constitute knowledge, but it is not necessary that one know that justification. Knowledge starts with beliefs that are not themselves knowledge but are justified.

70. [EP-035] Knowledge-Seeking as Description Satisfaction
   Sources: Solution to Meno's Paradox
   Thesis: Seeking knowledge involves knowing of a description that it is uniquely instantiated but not knowing what that instance is. Finding knowledge involves learning of some object that it satisfies that description.

71. [EP-036] Learning Presupposes Constitutive Knowledge
   Sources: Solution to Learner's Paradox
   Thesis: The ability to learn presupposes knowledge of a kind, but such knowledge is constitutive of one's mind and therefore isn't acquired. All acquired knowledge is learned, but not all knowledge is acquired.

72. [EP-037] Experiential Learning Hierarchy
   Sources: Dialogue on learning effectiveness
   Thesis: Learning proceeds through stages of increasing retention and depth: 'I forget what I hear. I remember what I see. I learn what I do.' Active doing produces the deepest learning.

73. [EP-038] Wisdom from Bitter Experience
   Sources: Dialogue on source of wisdom
   Thesis: All wisdom is based on experience, specifically bitter experience. Wisdom involves turning darkness into light - extracting positive lessons from negative experiences.

74. [EP-039] Induction as Explanatory Not Enumerative
   Sources: Essay 2
   Thesis: Induction is inherently explanatory rather than purely enumerative. Successful inductive inference requires integrating statistical data with implicit theoretical frameworks concerning causation, continuity, and natural kinds. Pure enumerative induction is fundamentally inadequate.

75. [EP-040] Discovery Follows Logical Principles
   Sources: Essay 3
   Thesis: Scientific discovery follows identifiable logical principles that are truth-tracking rather than merely psychological. Discovery and justification are not categorically distinct but interrelated aspects of theoretical reasoning.

76. [EP-041] Reverse Brain Engineering as Philosophy of Science Method
   Sources: Essay 4
   Thesis: By building AI systems that successfully replicate scientific reasoning, we can reverse-engineer cognitive principles underlying scientific discovery, providing empirically-grounded philosophy of science.

77. [EP-042] AI Falsifies External World Skepticism
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: AI systems' consistent success at tasks requiring external world knowledge (medical diagnosis, object tracking) demonstrates treating perceptions as causally connected to external reality leads to reliable knowledge. If external world skepticism were correct, such success would be miraculous.

78. [EP-043] Knowledge of Unobservables is Routine
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: Knowledge of unobservables is not only possible but routine when proper theoretical frameworks are in place. AI systems successfully infer unobservable entities from observable patterns.

79. [EP-044] Future Knowledge Through Causal Understanding
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: Knowledge of future is possible through understanding causal mechanisms and continuities. AI weather prediction demonstrates this through increasing accuracy.

80. [EP-045] Counterfactual Knowledge is Knowledge of Rule Systems
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: Counterfactual knowledge is genuine knowledge of existing rule systems and their implications. AI systems like AlphaGo demonstrate this through successful counterfactual reasoning.

81. [EP-046] No Knowledge is Purely Observational
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: All knowledge requires integration of empirical and conceptual/theoretical components. Pure observation without conceptual frameworks is insufficient for understanding.

82. [EP-047] Theoretical Understanding Requires Causation and Continuity
   Sources: Essay 5
   Thesis: Successful theoretical knowledge is based on understanding causal mechanisms and continuity. Statistical and theoretical components must be integrated—pure correlation is insufficient.

83. [EP-048] Gettier Problem Solution: Scalable Justification
   Sources: Essay 8
   Thesis: Knowledge requires more than justified true belief—it requires justification that serves as proper conduit between reality and belief. Gettier cases involve justification that isn't scalable: it may work in one case but fails systematically when applied broadly.

84. [EP-049] Coherentist Knowledge Architecture in AI
   Sources: Essay 8
   Thesis: Neural architecture of AI systems supports coherentist rather than foundationalist theory of knowledge. Both human and artificial knowledge are best understood as interconnected webs rather than hierarchical structures built on foundations.

85. [EP-050] AI Falsifies Enumerative Induction Model
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 2: How AI Falsifies Enumerative Induction)
   Thesis: AI systems demonstrate that successful induction does not proceed by enumerating instances and generalizing. Instead, AI uses pattern recognition, analogy, and constraint satisfaction that cannot be reduced to simple enumeration of cases.

86. [EP-051] Pattern Recognition as Alternative to Enumeration
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 2)
   Thesis: Successful inductive reasoning operates through pattern recognition mechanisms that identify structural similarities rather than counting instances. AI systems reveal this by succeeding at induction without explicit enumeration.

87. [EP-052] AI Resolves Rationalism vs Empiricism Debate
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 5: AI Resolves Epistemological Debates)
   Thesis: AI systems demonstrate that knowledge acquisition requires both innate structure (rationalist element) and learning from data (empiricist element). Neither pure rationalism nor pure empiricism can account for AI's success. The debate is resolved by recognizing both are necessary.

88. [EP-053] Innate Architecture is Necessary for Learning
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 5)
   Thesis: AI systems require substantial innate architectural constraints to learn successfully from data. This vindicates the rationalist insight that some knowledge structure must precede experience, while acknowledging the empiricist insight that specific content comes from experience.

89. [EP-054] Knowledge Acquisition is Neither Pure Discovery nor Pure Construction
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 5)
   Thesis: AI reveals that knowledge acquisition is neither pure discovery of pre-existing facts (naive realism) nor pure construction from experience (radical constructivism). It involves interaction between innate processing architecture and environmental structure.

90. [EP-055] AI Solves the Gettier Problem
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 11: AI and Gettier Problem)
   Thesis: AI learning systems demonstrate a solution to the Gettier problem by showing that genuine knowledge requires not just justified true belief but also that the justification tracks truth through a reliable causal-computational process. AI systems that learn reliably exemplify this tracking relationship.

91. [EP-056] Reliable Process Theory of Knowledge via AI
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 11)
   Thesis: AI systems reveal that knowledge requires beliefs formed through reliable processes that systematically track truth. This vindicates reliabilist theories of knowledge over traditional JTB (justified true belief) accounts.

92. [EP-057] Knowledge Systems Minimize Anomalies
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 19: Anomaly Minimization)
   Thesis: Both human knowledge and AI systems operate by minimizing anomalies - discrepancies between expectations and observations. This convergence reveals anomaly minimization as a fundamental principle of rational cognition.

93. [EP-058] AI Learning Mirrors Scientific Theory Revision
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 19)
   Thesis: The process by which AI systems update their models to accommodate new data mirrors the process of scientific theory revision in response to anomalies. This suggests a common underlying logic of belief revision.

94. [EP-059] Continuous Properties Are Cognitively Necessary
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 20: Binary Truth)
   Thesis: AI reveals that continuous (graded) properties are necessary for cognitive systems to handle uncertainty and partial information, but this doesn't entail that truth itself is non-binary. Epistemic gradations are compatible with metaphysical bivalence.

95. [EP-060] AI Vindicates Pragmatist Theory of Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 21: Pragmatism and AI)
   Thesis: AI development vindicates pragmatism's core insight that knowledge acquisition is fundamentally interactive rather than passive. AI systems learn through active engagement with their environment, validating pragmatist emphasis on the practical, interactive nature of inquiry.

96. [EP-061] AI as New Epistemic Faculty
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 21)
   Thesis: Interaction with AI constitutes a genuinely new epistemic faculty - a fourth level of observation beyond passive observation, active interaction, and tool creation. AI enables rational interaction with our own capacity for rational interaction, generating unique knowledge.

97. [EP-062] Knowledge is Inherently Perspectival and Interactive
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 21)
   Thesis: AI reveals that all knowledge, even 'objective' knowledge, begins from perspectival, interaction-based data driven by practical interests. There is no view from nowhere - even AI's knowledge is grounded in its interactions with reality.

98. [EP-063] Tool-Creating Interaction Generates Irreducible Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 21)
   Thesis: Creating tools (including AI) generates knowledge that cannot be obtained from merely using tools or observing passively. Each level of reflexive interaction (tool use, tool creation, AI development) reveals new knowledge irreducible to lower levels.

99. [EP-064] Two Kinds of Knowledge: Direct and Indirect
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: There are exactly two kinds of knowledge: direct (non-inferential, primitive) knowledge and indirect (inferential) knowledge. All knowledge falls into one of these two categories.

100. [EP-065] All Theoretical Knowledge is Inferential
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: All theoretical knowledge is inferential knowledge, though not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. Theoretical knowledge requires reasoning from observations to explanatory hypotheses.

101. [EP-066] Knowledge is Justified True Belief (But Not Vice Versa)
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: All knowledge is justified true belief, but not all justified true belief is knowledge. Additional conditions beyond justification, truth, and belief are required for knowledge.

102. [EP-067] Two Kinds of Dependence Relations: Causal and Logical
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: There are exactly two fundamental types of dependence relations: causal dependence relations and logical dependence relations. These are distinct and irreducible to each other.

103. [EP-068] Logical Dependence Relations Not Known Through Observation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Relations of logical dependence are not known through observation. They are known a priori, through conceptual analysis or reasoning, not through empirical investigation.

104. [EP-069] Causal Relations Known Through Observation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Causal relations are known through observation. Unlike logical relations, causal dependencies are empirical matters discoverable through perception and experience.

105. [EP-070] Analytic Knowledge is Always Knowledge of Dependence Relations
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Analytic knowledge is always and necessarily knowledge of dependence-relations. To know analytic truths is to know how concepts or propositions depend on each other.

106. [EP-071] Propositions Are the Objects of Belief
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Propositions, not objects or states of affairs, are the proper objects of belief. To believe is to take a proposition to be true.

107. [EP-072] Knowledge Distinct From Awareness
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Knowledge must be sharply distinguished from mere awareness. One can be aware of something without knowing anything about it, and one can know things without being directly aware of them.

108. [EP-073] The Concept of Evidence: Causal Relatedness
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* if and only if e and e* are causally related such that knowledge of e's existence provides reason to believe in e*'s existence.

109. [EP-074] Information-Transmission as Structure-Preservation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Information-transmission is structure-preservation. An information-bearing series is one in which earlier events transmit their structure to later events through causal processes that preserve structural relationships.

110. [EP-075] Information Distinct From Evidence
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. Evidence requires only causal relatedness; information requires causal relatedness plus structure-preservation.

111. [EP-076] Information-Transmission as the Basis of Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Knowledge is based on information-transmission. Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent, inheriting structure from their causes. Beliefs are knowledge only to the extent they are linked by information-transmissive series to corresponding realities.

112. [EP-077] Knowledge Independent of Statistical Reliability
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The difference between knowledge and mere belief is not statistical. A belief is knowledge if and only if it is the end-result of an information-transmissive series, regardless of the general reliability of the mechanism that produced it.

113. [EP-080] Biological Impossibility of Extreme Relativist Beliefs
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: It is biologically impossible to actually believe extreme relativist or deconstructionist positions. No one is drawn to such positions because they believe them; they perpetrate fraud for reasons of convenience, ego, and hate.

114. [EP-081] Parental Instincts as Embodied Knowledge
   Sources: Chapter Introduction
   Thesis: Knowledge of the importance of healthy early-life attachments for psychological health is embodied in parental instincts. Parents, especially mothers, are naturally inclined to bond with their children, particularly when they are young and vulnerable, indicating innate recognition of attachment's developmental significance.

115. [EP-082] Sellars' Myth of the Given
   Sources: Chapter Main argument
   Thesis: According to Sellars, what makes a given bit of phenomenal content have particular representational content is the addition of background knowledge and contextualizing information. To think that phenomenal content has intrinsic representational content is to commit 'the myth of the given' - a spurious epistemic foundationalism.

116. [EP-083] Sensations as Property-Indeterminate Without Background Knowledge
   Sources: Chapter Tie shop and goggles arguments
   Thesis: Visual sensations (and sensory qualia generally) are property-indeterminate by themselves. In non-standard perceptual conditions (e.g., unusual lighting in the tie shop, or wearing magnifying goggles), the same sensation could correspond to different objective properties. Background knowledge about conditions of perception is required to determine which property the sensation represents.

117. [EP-084] Two Versions of Anti-Foundationalism
   Sources: Chapter Theoretical summary
   Thesis: Sellars' attack on the myth of the given comes in two strengths. Weak version: it is not typically true that qualia by themselves constitute awareness (knowledge) of anything external - something extra is needed to make a quale epistemic. Strong version: it is not typically true that qualia by themselves constitute representations - something extra is needed to give them representational content. Both versions are correct.

118. [EP-085] Intentionalism Commits the Myth of the Given
   Sources: Chapter Conclusion
   Thesis: Intentionalism is a strong form of foundationalism guilty of the myth of the given in both its forms. Intentionalism holds that qualia by themselves have determinate representational content without needing background knowledge, and that background knowledge cannot affect their representational content. This makes qualia foundational, performing representational and epistemic roles in isolation from epistemic context - precisely the foundationalism Sellars refuted.

119. [EP-086] Learning Correspondence Rules for Non-Standard Perceptual Conditions
   Sources: Chapter Correspondence rule acquisition
   Thesis: When perceptual conditions are non-standard, subjects must learn correspondence rules mapping sensations-under-those-conditions to objective properties. This learning requires checking sensations against how things appear under standard conditions. Once internalized, these rules enable immediate perception of properties even under non-standard conditions.

120. [EP-087] Kant's Synthetic A Priori is Really Hard Analytic
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Sections III-IX
   Thesis: Kant's 'synthetic a priori' truths (like 7+5=12 and 'a straight line is the shortest distance between two points') are not actually synthetic but rather 'hard analytic' - they are analytic truths that are difficult to recognize as such, requiring cognitive effort rather than immediate apprehension.

121. [EP-088] Easy Analytic Versus Hard Analytic Distinction
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Section IX
   Thesis: Analytic truths divide into 'easy analytic' and 'hard analytic.' Easy analytic truths (e.g., 'circles are round,' 'triangles have three sides') are such that grasping them suffices for knowing their truth - denying them involves psychological as well as logical incoherence. Hard analytic truths (e.g., 'a circle is a class of points equidistant from a given point in a plane') involve only logical incoherence when denied; a sane person could believe their negation without psychic fragmentation.

122. [EP-089] A Priori as Epistemological, Not Logical Property
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Section II
   Thesis: For Kant, a priority is a property of our knowledge of propositions, not of propositions themselves. A proposition is a priori not in virtue of intrinsic logical properties but in virtue of how one comes to know it. Consequently, a proposition could in principle be a priori for one creature and a posteriori for another.

123. [EP-090] Ex Nihilo Events are Logically Impossible
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Section VI
   Thesis: There are no ex nihilo (uncaused) events. The spatio-temporal manifold would comprise ex nihilo events only if it comprised events not co-located with other events - only if it comprised events it didn't comprise. Propositions alleging uncaused events (e.g., 'the newspaper spontaneously combusted') are self-contradictory when properly understood.

124. [EP-091] Induction Justified by Analog Data, Not Digital Propositions
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Sections VII-VIII
   Thesis: Induction is justified by continuous, analog sensory data rather than by discrete digital propositions. The logical basis for induction is precisely what is lost in digitization involved in embodying knowledge in propositions like 'every swan I've seen is white.' We subtly misrepresent our grounds for inductive belief when we try to propositionalize (digitize) them.

125. [EP-092] Propositions as Schematic Meta-Data, Not Data
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Section VIII
   Thesis: Propositions like 'every swan I've ever seen is white' are not the data that motivate or legitimate inductive beliefs - they are meta-data. Describing such propositions as 'data' is like identifying a court's finding of guilty with actuality of guilt. We cannot work backwards from meta-data to data, just as we cannot recover subtle speech inflections from stenographer's transcript.

126. [EP-093] Digital-Analog Compatibility Distinction
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Section IX
   Thesis: We must distinguish digital-compatibility from analog-compatibility - what is permissible given propositions from what is permissible given the analog data those propositions schematically represent. Propositions 'the rock will sprout wings' and 'no stone has ever sprouted wings' are digitally compatible, but their analog correlates involve discontinuities and perforations of space-time manifold making them analog-incompatible.

127. [EP-094] Goodman's Grue Problem Exposes Hume's Circularity
   Sources: Chapter Part 3, Section VIII
   Thesis: As Nelson Goodman showed, given any explanatorily useful property x, we can construct explanatorily useless property y (like 'grue' or 'plopper') such that x and y are indistinguishable from purely statistical viewpoint. This exposes circularity in Hume's reasoning: properties like 'copper' are not inductively innocent but already embody causal/inductive commitments.

128. [EP-095] Phenomenal States Require Theoretical Context (Sellars)
   Sources: Chapter Part 3, Section VIII
   Thesis: Following Sellars' Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind: purely phenomenal states are representationally and epistemically empty except in context of knowledge concerning conditions under which they are experienced. Relevant contextual information can be given only in inductively and theoretically committed terms.

157. [EP-124] Introspection cannot settle causal questions
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1545-1570)
   Thesis: Introspection can reveal what mental states we're in but cannot reveal causal relations between mental states and behavior. Causal questions are empirical, requiring observation of patterns across cases, not introspective certainty. Therefore, introspection cannot establish that conscious will causes action.

158. [EP-125] Role of Intuition in Modal Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2226-2233)
   Thesis: Modal intuitions (about what's possible/necessary) play a crucial but problematic role in modal epistemology and cannot be simply dismissed.

159. [EP-126] Arbitrariness as Theoretical Vice
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines Part V discussions, MODAL-014)

160. [EP-127] Modal Knowledge via Structural Analysis
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2259-2290)
   Thesis: We know modal truths by examining the internal structure of propositions—how their constituent concepts are arranged and related—not by surveying alternative worlds.

161. [EP-128] Conceptual Understanding as Basic
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2259-2290, implicit throughout)
   Thesis: Some forms of understanding (like grasping concepts and their relations) are basic and cannot be further analyzed or reduced to other cognitive processes.

162. [EP-129] Meaning cannot be reduced to observable consequences
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 61-86)
   Thesis: The pragmatist thesis (i) that 'the meaning of a hypothesis lies in its observable consequences' is false. The relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic, as it depends on what operative conditions and causal mechanisms obtain.

163. [EP-130] Truth is not identical with utility or power
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 301-312)
   Thesis: The pragmatist thesis (ii) that 'a true idea is one that allows us to control the world' conflates truth with knowledge. What pragmatism incorrectly represents as a virtue of truth itself should be correctly understood as a virtue of our knowledge of truth. It isn't truth that is empowering: it is knowledge.

164. [EP-131] Truth is not identical with assimilability
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 283-296)
   Thesis: The pragmatist thesis (iii) that 'true ideas are those we can assimilate, false ones are those we cannot' is false when taken literally. There are highly assimilable false ideas and highly non-assimilable true ones. Truth is not assimilability; rather, knowledge is assimilated truth.

165. [EP-132] Externalism threatens self-knowledge
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines Chapter 19)
   Thesis: If externalism is true—if mental content is individuated by external factors unknown to the subject—then subjects cannot have privileged access to their own thoughts. This conflicts with the apparent fact that we have immediate, authoritative knowledge of what we're thinking.

166. [EP-138] Counterfactuals as epistemic probability relations
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Counterfactuals are not statements about states of affairs in alternative worlds, but rather express relations of probabilification holding among statements. They register confirmation relations among propositions - the degree of credibility that certain propositions confer on other propositions. The factualist (possible worlds) analysis makes counterfactuals incoherent.

167. [EP-139] Counterfactuals are crypto-probability propositions
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: 'If A had been the case, then B would have been the case' means: The proposition K and A gives a high probability to B, where K is the conjunction of propositions we know to be true, minus the proposition that A and B were not the case.

168. [EP-140] Probability is epistemic not metaphysical
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Probability is an epistemic, not a metaphysical, notion. Probability is a logical relation between propositions, not a property of states of affairs. When we say 'there is a 5% probability that Socrates had four kidneys,' we are saying something about epistemic possibility given our data, not about metaphysical possibility.

169. [EP-141] False propositions probabilify other propositions
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: False propositions probabilify other propositions just like true ones. 'The moon is made of cheese' is false, but it still gives very high probability to 'there is a piece of cheese that weighs more than 100 lbs.' 'Kennedy didn't die in '63' is false but still gives probability to other propositions.

170. [EP-142] Counterfactual truth independent of empirical discoveries
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: The truth of counterfactuals is not contingent on empirical discoveries about the balance of determinism and indeterminism in nature. 'If Jones had struck the window, it would have shattered' doesn't become false if scientists discover unexpected mixtures of determinism. This shows factualist analysis is wrong.

171. [EP-143] The Frequency Theory of Probability is false
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The Frequency Theory of Probability (which identifies probabilities with observed frequencies) is false. Probabilities are determined by laws and causal mechanisms, not by statistical patterns. Identical laws yield identical probabilities regardless of statistical divergences, and different causal structures yield different probabilities regardless of statistical similarities.

172. [EP-143] The Frequency Theory of Probability is false
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: Frequency Theory (FT) - the view that probabilities are identical with statistical frequencies - is false. Refuted by W1/W2 thought experiment and smoking-cancer example.

173. [EP-144] Truth out of context as damaging as falsehood
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part I)
   Thesis: Truths taken out of context, or made available to people who don't know how to contextualize them, can be as damaging as falsehoods and lead to confusion that enables acceptance of falsehoods.

174. [EP-145] Plato's extreme rationalism is political, not epistemological
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Plato's radical epistemological claim that observables are unreal 'shadows' while only pure thought accesses reality is not genuine epistemology but political belief presented as epistemological belief, driven by fear of political change.

175. [EP-146] Plato's epistemology rationalizes his social position
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Plato's epistemological views make little sense as epistemology but make perfect sense as attempts to rationalize and preserve his privileged social position against threatening changes.

176. [EP-147] Descartes' epistemology responds to Church authority crisis
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Descartes' epistemological project was fundamentally an attempt to cope with social unrest caused by science stripping Catholic Church of credibility. He sought new certainties to replace discredited Church certainties.

177. [EP-148] Extreme rationalism correlates with anxiety about social change
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Both Plato and Descartes advocate extreme rationalism (overplaying role of thought, underplaying observation) because both were uneasy about social changes - Plato unambivalently hostile, Descartes ambivalently accepting.

178. [EP-149] Empiricizing philosophy enables world-engagement
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: Locke and Hume's empiricism represented attempt to make philosophy engage the world. Their political philosophies succeeded precisely to extent they empiricized/anti-philosophized philosophy.

179. [EP-150] Empiricism collapses into skepticism/autistic withdrawal
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: The empiricist project ultimately defeats itself: arch-empiricism (knowledge only of direct sensory evidence) collapses into pure skepticism (knowledge only of conscious states), representing the most complete autistic withdrawal from reality.

180. [ETH-008] Political Legitimacy Requires Both Effectiveness and Respect for Freedom
   Sources: Implicit in overall structure of argument and conclusion
   Thesis: A legitimate political system must satisfy both consequentialist criteria (it must actually work to improve people's lives) and deontological criteria (it must respect people's freedom and right to choose their own path). Systems that fail on either dimension are illegitimate.

181. [ETH-009] Pathological Concern with Ethics Derives from Crypto-Criminal Orientation
   Sources: Lines 35
   Thesis: Both obsessive-compulsives and philosophers are pathologically concerned with ethics because they are crypto-criminals whose fundamental orientation is anti-social, but who have draconian superegos and thus suppress their criminal side.

182. [ETH-010] Deontological Ethics Precludes Coercive Wealth Redistribution
   Sources: Chapter When is wealth-redistribution legitimate?
   Thesis: According to deontological ethics (Kant, Ross), wealth cannot legitimately be redistributed through coercion, even if equal distribution would be desirable. The means (coercing people, thwarting autonomy) cannot be justified by the ends (wealth equality).

183. [ETH-011] Kant and Ross Would Not Regard Wealth Equality as Particularly Desirable
   Sources: Chapter When is wealth-redistribution legitimate?
   Thesis: Even if there were morally innocuous way of achieving/maintaining wealth equality, neither Kant nor Ross would regard it as particularly desirable state of affairs. They would see it as desirable only to extent necessary for people to treat each other with respect - not clear that wealth equality particularly conducive to that end.

184. [ETH-012] Lies Cannot Be Justified by Unjust Ends They Serve
   Sources: Chapter Plato's Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy
   Thesis: If a conception of justice is fundamentally unjust (denying basic freedoms), then lies told to maintain that conception cannot be distinguished into good and bad lies. All lies serving unjust ends are thereby unjust regardless of intentions.

185. [ETH-013] Psychopathic Discourse as Career-Based Integrity Undermining
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: When people engage in hand-waving about deconstructionism, narratives, and critiques, they are revealed as individuals who themselves have no integrity and whose careers constitute attempts to undermine the very notion of integrity. One should promptly disengage from such people.

186. [ETH-014] Psychopathy as Categorical Moral Incapacity
   Sources: Chapter Psychopathy definition
   Thesis: Psychopaths lack conscience and are fundamentally incapable of genuine moral engagement. Their callous disregard for others, manipulativeness, and deceitfulness constitute not mere moral failings but categorical incapacity for the moral domain. They cannot form the kinds of attachments and relationships that ground normal moral agency.

187. [ETHICS-001] Ability-Character Complementarity
   Sources: Multiple dialogues on ability, talent, and achievement
   Thesis: Human abilities differ little by nature; it is habits and character (diligence, persistence) that separate people. Genius is made through dilligence, not born.

188. [ETHICS-002] Process Over Outcomes in Evaluation
   Sources: Dialogues on failure, success, and perseverance
   Thesis: What matters is success relative to failure, not the absence of failure. 'Our greatest glory lies not in never falling but in getting up every time we do.' Successful people stumble many times; their successes, not their failures, define them.

189. [ETHICS-003] Pace Irrelevance in Progress

190. [ETHICS-004] Internal vs. External Worth
   Sources: Dialogue on fame and accomplishment

191. [ETHICS-005] Universal Teacherhood Principle
   Sources: Dialogue on learning from wise men vs. fools

193. [ETHICS-007] Anger's Misguiding Influence
   Sources: Dialogues on anger and revenge
   Thesis: Under anger's influence, conduct is misguided. One should take a time-out and revisit situations from a calmer vantage. Before acting in anger, think of the consequences.

194. [FW-001] Conscious will as awareness of unconscious intention
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 233-275)
   Thesis: The conscious event W that a subject experiences as their decision to act is not the operative intention itself, but rather an awareness of an intention that has already been formed unconsciously. The readiness potential (RP) precedes W by approximately 350ms.

195. [FW-002] W is not epiphenomenal despite lacking causal role
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 252-266)
   Thesis: Although W (conscious awareness of intention) is epiphenomenal with respect to the particular finger-movement in Libet's experiment, it is not epiphenomenal tout court. W has causal effects on subsequent intentions and behaviors.

196. [FW-003] Libet challenges compatibilism more than determinism
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1617-1632)
   Thesis: The Libet experiment is more threatening to compatibilism than to traditional debates about determinism. The problem is not that choices are predetermined, but that what we experience as conscious decisions are 'on the sidelines'—not the operative causes at all.

197. [FW-004] Libet's results more radical than Freud's unconscious
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1648-1669)
   Thesis: Libet's findings are more radical than Freud's theory of the unconscious. Freud showed that some mental activity occurs unconsciously while treating consciousness as having real but limited power. Libet shows that even paradigmatic conscious decisions are not conscious decisions at all.

198. [FW-005] Consciousness integrates internal and external information
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1709-1728)
   Thesis: One purpose of consciousness is to integrate real-time awareness of external events (sense-perceptions) with real-time awareness of internal processes (introspections). Consciousness pools these two datasets, though decisions are made unconsciously.

199. [FW-006] Conscious awareness serves approval/veto function
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1728-1768)
   Thesis: W (conscious awareness) does not make decisions but rather approves or vetoes decisions already made unconsciously. Acts experienced as conscious decision-making are actually conscious acts of decision-approval. This approval extends to future similar intentions.

200. [FW-007] The illusion of free choice is functionally adaptive
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1750-1756)
   Thesis: The experience of conscious decision-making as the source of our actions (when it's actually approval of unconscious decisions) is an adaptive illusion that prevents consciousness from being overburdened. The 'illusion of free choice' is a small price to pay for cognitive efficiency.

201. [FW-008] Critique of 'phenomenological datum' argument for free will
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1547-1556)
   Thesis: The argument that we 'just know' we have free will because it's a phenomenological datum is question-begging and misconceived. The cogito is analytically true (thinking requires a thinker), but free will is a form of causation, and causal relations are always open empirical questions.

202. [FW-009] Critique of 'Libet actions don't engage rationality' objection
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1490-1502)
   Thesis: The objection that Libet's results don't generalize because they involve simple actions that fail to engage rationality is unsupported and likely false. First, there's no experimental data supporting this claim. Second, more deliberation makes it less likely that operative intentions are fully conscious.

203. [FW-010] Philosophers' rejection of Libet uses inadequate standards
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1813-1827)
   Thesis: Philosophers evaluating Libet's data employ standards of proof so stringent that by the same standards, there would be no reason to believe smoking causes cancer. By refusing to accept and model Libet's replicated findings, philosophers blind themselves to valuable information.

204. [FW-011] Standing intentions cannot be constituents of consciousness
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 452-461)
   Thesis: Standing intentions (e.g., intention to write a book over three years) are enduring structures like knowledge that 2+2=4. They cannot be constituents of consciousness because consciousness involves momentary events. One can be conscious of standing intentions, but they are not themselves conscious states.

205. [FW-012] Libet's findings likely extend to complex deliberative actions
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 433-448)
   Thesis: If intentions governing real-time actions (where consciousness is most heavily involved) are unconscious, it is doubly unlikely that intentions governing complex, deliberative actions are conscious. Complex intentions develop through protracted, largely unconscious thought-processes.

206. [FW-013] The 0.2 second delay is not mere tape-delay
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 471-488)
   Thesis: The 0.2 second delay between intention (RP onset) and conscious awareness (W) is not merely the minimum processing time required for awareness. Consciousness operates extremely quickly—sprinters can be conscious of individual steps and sub-components. The delay likely reflects W's functional role as action-monitor rather than action-instigator.

207. [FW-014] Determinism defined as universal causation
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: Determinism is the doctrine that nothing is uncaused. If determinism is correct, how the world is now determines exactly how it will be in the future, and how it was in the past determines exactly how it is now.

208. [FW-015] Indeterminism entails some chaos
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: If indeterminism is true, the universe is chaotic to a non-null degree. A single uncaused event makes indeterminism correct, regardless of how minute that event is or how orderly the rest of the universe.

209. [FW-016] Indeterminism threatens freedom more than determinism
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: Indeterminism is more of a threat to freedom than determinism. Determinism is not a threat to freedom but is actually necessary for it. Indeterminism is as fatal to freedom as determinism is necessary for it.

210. [FW-017] External indeterminism doesn't increase freedom
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: If the external world (outside our bodies) were indeterministic while our minds/bodies remained deterministic, we would not be more free. In a highly indeterministic world where baseballs might turn into hawks, we would have less control and thus less freedom.

211. [FW-018] Internal indeterminism doesn't increase freedom
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: If our nervous systems were indeterministic, we wouldn't be more free. An indeterministic nervous system means current state fails to determine later states, so decisions don't reliably lead to actions. Knowledge at one time wouldn't reliably influence decisions later.

212. [FW-019] Mechanisms require determinism
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: Where there are mechanisms, there is determinism. Where there is indeterminism, there are no mechanisms. A mechanism is something that can be relied on to produce an output of a certain kind when given an input of a certain kind. Mechanisms exist only to the extent the universe is deterministic.

213. [FW-020] Indeterministic minds are incoherent
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: The more indeterministic a mind is, the more incoherent it is - its future states fail to cohere with present states, present with past. An indeterministic mind is no mind at all, but rather a series of mutually isolated minds, each existing only for an instant and therefore not existing at all.

214. [FW-021] Freedom requires appropriate mental state responsiveness
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: Inner freedom consists in one's current mental state embodying appropriate responsiveness to previous mental states, and future mental states embodying the right sort of responsiveness to present mental states. Freedom is about having a mind whose mental states determine one another in the right way, not about having undetermined mental states.

215. [FW-022] Freedom as causal integration
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: A person is free if their mind is constitutive of the right sort of causal integration. Freedom requires both determinism (causal integrity) and the correct kind of causal structure, but determinism alone is not sufficient for freedom.

216. [FW-023] Responsibility requires agent-constitutive causation
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: For an action to be free is for the agent to be responsible for it. For an agent to be responsible is for agent-constitutive forces to be responsible for it, which means for them to cause it. Prior to the agent's existence, we cannot speak of the agent being made to do anything. Once in existence, being made to do something consists in agent-constitutive forces being directed contrary to the agent's objectives; doing something freely consists in those forces aligning with the agent's objectives.

217. [HIST-001] Material Conditions Shape Consciousness
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 13, 50-100)
   Thesis: Material developments (like writing and economic organization) fundamentally shape modes of consciousness, including temporal awareness and rationality.

218. [HIST-2] Socrates operationally trained oligarchic coup leaders
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part III)
   Thesis: Socrates didn't merely 'lay groundwork' for oligarchic coups - he operationally trained the men who tried to take over Athens (Critias, Alcibiades, Charmides). He was assembling a team, not innocently thinking.

   Thesis: Following Strawson: descriptions presuppose existence. Abortive (not false) when presupposition fails.

228. [LANG-010] Against Contextualism

   Sources: WORK-004
   Thesis: Anaphoric descriptions refer to entities introduced by antecedents. Not bound variables.

231. [LANG-013] Logical Form vs Semantics
   Sources: WORK-004
   Thesis: Logical form (inferential structure) ≠ semantics (literal meaning). Same proposition can have multiple logical forms.

232. [LANG-014] Logical Form vs Grammatical Form (Frege's Insight)
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 1)
   Thesis: Logical form is not identical with grammatical form. What a sentence says is not always what its grammatical structure suggests.

233. [LANG-015] Propositions as Abstract Objects
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 3)
   Thesis: Propositions are abstract, mind-independent objects that exist outside space and time.

   Thesis: Linguistic meaning is not reducible to mental states or psychological facts.

236. [LANG-018] Russell's Theory of Descriptions
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 6)
   Thesis: Definite descriptions are not referring terms. 'The F is G' means 'Something uniquely is F, and any such thing is G.'

237. [LANG-019] Frege's Sense/Reference Distinction Collapses into Russellianism
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 6)
   Thesis: Frege's theory that definite descriptions have both sense and reference collapses into Russell's theory.

238. [LANG-020] Against Fregean Intensional Contexts

   Thesis: Literal meaning (semantic content) must be distinguished from cognitive significance.

240. [LANG-022] Semantic Externalism (Putnam's Insight)
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 9)
   Thesis: Meanings of natural kind terms are partially determined by facts external to the speaker's mind.

241. [LANG-023] Systematicity and Productivity of Language
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Languages exhibit two fundamental properties: (1) Productivity - expressions can be combined into larger expressions, and (2) Systematicity - parts composing complex expressions can be re-arranged to form other expressions.

242. [LANG-024] Semantic Rules Are Ultimately Descriptive
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 1
   Thesis: Semantic rules describe what speakers mean/understand by expressions. They are not purely conventional stipulations independent of speaker practices. For 'red' to mean red just IS for speakers to mean/understand red by 'red'.

243. [LANG-025] Names as Concept-Laden Labels
   Sources: Solution to Kripke's Paradox
   Thesis: Names are mere labels (non-descriptive), as Kripke argued, but labels 'pick up' descriptive information through how one learns their reference. Semantics (what expressions literally mean) differs from knowledge of semantics (how meaning is known), and this difference explains apparent descriptive content.

244. [LANG-026] Co-referential Names Can Differ in Meaning
   Sources: Solution to Frege's Puzzle
   Thesis: 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' differ in meaning despite co-referring. 'Superman is in the building' says that a certain property-set (superhuman strength, flight ability, etc.) is uniquely instantiated and any such instance is in the building. 'Clark Kent is in the building' says a different property-set (reporter, wears glasses, etc.) is uniquely instantiated.

245. [LANG-027] Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction is Real
   Sources: Essay 6
   Thesis: LLMs' demonstrated capabilities provide empirical support for classical theories of meaning, particularly the distinction between semantics (literal meaning) and pragmatics (communicated meaning), and the reality of compositional literal meaning.

246. [LANG-028] Compositional Understanding Emerges from Statistical Learning
   Sources: Essay 6
   Thesis: Compositional capabilities can emerge through statistical learning rather than requiring classical computational implementation. Both humans and AI develop compositional understanding through different but convergent paths.

247. [LANG-029] Literal Meaning is Real but Emergent
   Sources: Essay 6
   Thesis: Literal meaning is real rather than illusory, but emergent rather than primary. It develops through triangulation from contextual uses rather than being foundational to language.

248. [LANG-030] Grammar and Logic Are Aligned
   Sources: Essay 7
   Thesis: LLMs' ability to make correct inferences without FOL-style logical forms suggests grammatical structure itself guides valid reasoning. Perceived misalignment between grammatical and logical form may be artifact of our chosen formal systems rather than feature of language itself.

249. [LANG-031] Logical Form is Cognitively Inert
   Sources: Essay 7
   Thesis: Traditional logical form is cognitively inert: people reason without it, LLMs function without it, it plays no role in actual inference. Logical form is constructed rather than discovered, follows rather than guides comprehension, and is system-relative rather than unique.

250. [LANG-032] Universal Grammar as Neural Architecture
   Sources: Essay 9
   Thesis: Chomskyan insights about linguistic universals can be reconciled with connectionism by understanding UG as feature of neural architecture rather than set of explicit rules. UG constraints operate through architectural properties of neural networks rather than explicit rule-following.

251. [LANG-033] AI Vindicates Semantics-Pragmatics Distinction
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 6: AI Vindicates Classical Theories of Meaning)
   Thesis: Large language models demonstrate a clear distinction between semantic content (literal meaning) and pragmatic interpretation (context-dependent meaning). The success of LLMs requires maintaining this distinction, vindicating classical theories of meaning against pragmatist attempts to collapse semantics into pragmatics.

252. [LANG-034] Literal Meaning is Computationally Prior to Pragmatic Interpretation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 6)
   Thesis: AI systems must compute literal semantic content before applying pragmatic adjustments. This computational priority reveals that semantics is foundational and pragmatics is derivative, supporting classical over post-modern theories of meaning.

253. [LANG-035] Context-Independence of Core Semantics
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 6)
   Thesis: LLMs demonstrate that core semantic content can be represented context-independently and then applied across contexts. This vindicates the classical view that meaning has a stable core that pragmatic factors modulate rather than wholly constitute.

254. [LANG-036] AI Vindicates Syntax-Semantics Interface
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 7: AI Vindicates Classical Grammar)
   Thesis: Large language models demonstrate that grammatical structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics) are distinct but systematically related. The success of LLMs requires explicit representation of this interface, vindicating classical grammatical theory against attempts to reduce one to the other.

255. [LANG-037] Syntactic Structure Constrains Semantic Interpretation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 7)
   Thesis: AI language systems reveal that syntactic structure constrains possible semantic interpretations. This supports the classical view that grammar is not arbitrary convention but reflects systematic constraints on meaning composition.

256. [LANG-038] Compositional Semantics Requires Syntactic Structure
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 7)
   Thesis: The ability of LLMs to understand novel sentences demonstrates that semantic interpretation is compositional - the meaning of complex expressions derives systematically from their parts and syntactic structure. This requires and vindicates traditional compositional semantic theories.

257. [LANG-039] Grammar and Logic are Fundamentally Aligned
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 8: Grammar-Logic Alignment)
   Thesis: AI language systems demonstrate that grammatical structure and logical form are fundamentally aligned - grammatical categories and relations correspond to logical types and operations. This alignment is not accidental but reflects deep unity of form in human cognition.

258. [LANG-040] Universal Grammar Can Be Implemented Subsymbolically
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 12: Chomskyan Challenge)
   Thesis: AI demonstrates that universal grammar principles can be implemented through subsymbolic connectionist architectures rather than requiring explicit symbolic rules. The functional role of UG is preserved even if implementation differs from classical theory.

259. [LANG-041] Universal Grammar Principles Extend to Music
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 15: UG in Language and Music)
   Thesis: AI analysis reveals that the computational principles underlying universal grammar in language also apply to music cognition. Both domains share abstract structural principles about hierarchical organization and rule-governed combination.

260. [LANG-045] Presupposition Versus Assertion in Perceptual Reports
   Sources: Chapter Objection and reply
   Thesis: When sensations are property-indeterminate (as in the tie shop), one cannot assert 'the tie is maroon' based on sensation alone. One might respond that the sensation presupposes rather than asserts a determinacy. But this conflates epistemology with semantics - the point is that sensation doesn't tell you which property obtains, not that it pragmatically presupposes one.

261. [LANG-046] 'Some' Presupposes Rather Than Asserts Existence
   Sources: Chapter Point #1 and #2
   Thesis: 'Some phi is a psi' is not an existence-claim. It does not assert that there exists at least one phi that is also a psi. Rather, it merely presupposes that there is at least one phi. This concerns literal meaning (semantics), not what is conveyed by implicature.

262. [LANG-047] 'All' is Incompatible With 'Some'
   Sources: Chapter Point #3
   Thesis: 'All phi's are psi's' is incompatible with 'some phi's are psi's.' The former entails the negation of the latter and thus isn't compatible with it. This concerns literal meaning, not pragmatic implicature.

263. [LANG-048] Numerals Express Exact Quantities
   Sources: Chapter Point #4
   Thesis: For any numeral n, 'n phi's are psi's' is to the effect that exactly n phi's are psi's. 'Five elephants can dance' means exactly five elephants can dance, not 'at least five.' If six elephants can dance, the statement 'five elephants can dance' is literally false, not merely misleading.

264. [LANG-049] Incompatibility of Different Numeral Statements
   Sources: Chapter Point #5
   Thesis: If m≠n, 'm phi's are psi's' is incompatible with 'n phi's are psi's.' 'Ten elephants can dance' is incompatible with 'five elephants can dance.' This is an immediate consequence of numerals expressing exact quantities.

265. [LANG-050] Numerals as Substantives Versus Adjectives
   Sources: Chapter Substantive vs. adjective argument
   Thesis: In '5 + 5 = 10,' numerals function as substantives (nouns), synonymous with 'the number 5' and 'the number 10.' In '5 things plus 5 other things add up to exactly 10 things,' the same numerals function as adjectives. Despite this syntactic difference, the expressions have extremely similar meanings, which would be impossible if numerals meant 'at least n.'

266. [LANG-051] Sentence Truth-Conditions Versus Proposition Truth-Conditions
   Sources: Chapter Preliminary distinctions
   Thesis: The logical properties of propositions aren't always in lockstep with those of the sentences (or sentence-tokens) that express them. For definite descriptions with Strawson-type semantics, the sentence 'that phi is psi' has different truth-conditions from the proposition it expresses in context.

267. [LANG-052] Response Adequacy Test for Existence Claims
   Sources: Chapter Similar argument
   Thesis: If asked 'do any felines exist?', responding '(A) Yes. There exists at least one feline; moreover, at least one feline is ferocious' is completely non-defective, but responding '(B) some felines are ferocious' is defective. This shows (B) presupposes rather than asserts existence, distinguishing it from (A).

268. [LANG-053] Anti-Gricean Analysis of Quantifiers and Numerals
   Sources: Chapter Throughout - explicit rejection of implicature analysis
   Thesis: The correct analysis of 'some,' 'all,' and numerals concerns literal meaning (semantics), not conversational implicature. 'Some' means 'some but not all' at the level of semantics, not just by Gricean implicature. Similarly, 'five' means 'exactly five' semantically, not 'at least five' with an implicature of exactness.

280. [LANG-28] No entity has both meaning and reference
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 115-116)
   Thesis: Reference is a property of spatio-temporal entities (expression tokens). Sense is a property of Platonic entities (expression types). No single entity possesses both properties. The Fregean picture of expressions having both sense and reference is confused.

281. [LANG-29] All meaningful expression-tokens refer
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 117)
   Thesis: On the correct conception of reference, all meaningful expression-tokens refer, including syncategorematic expressions like 'or', 'if', and case-markers. These refer to higher-order functions. The categorematic/syncategorematic distinction collapses given a proper understanding of reference.

282. [LANG-30] Sentence-tokens refer to propositions (or proposition-involving functions)
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 137, 174-178)
   Thesis: Sentence-tokens refer. Forceless sentence-tokens (those embedded in larger sentences without force) refer to propositions. Forced sentence-tokens (those with assertoric or other force) refer to functions involving propositions, not identical with propositions.

283. [LANG-31] Sentence-types have functions for meanings, not propositions
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 186-197)
   Thesis: Sentence-types do not have propositions for their meanings. All sentence-types uniformly have functions from contexts of utterance to propositions for their meanings. This holds even for seemingly non-indexical sentences like '2+2=4'—the uniformity of the class 'sentence' requires this.

284. [LANG-32] Expression-types do not refer; only tokens refer
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 185, 199)
   Thesis: Expression-types categorically cannot refer to anything. Even the expression-type 'Plato' doesn't refer to Plato; it has a constant function (from contexts to Plato) for its meaning. Only tokens of 'Plato' refer to Plato.

285. [LANG-33] Replacing co-referring terms cannot change meaning
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 946-990)
   Thesis: If two terms genuinely co-refer (refer to the same thing), then replacing one with the other cannot result in a change of meaning. What it means to say that terms co-refer just is that sentences differing only in those terms have the same meaning. All contexts are extensional at the level of literal meaning.

286. [LANG-34] Sentences do not refer to truth-values
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 127, 134-137, 160)
   Thesis: Frege's thesis that sentences refer to truth-values is false. Sentence-tokens do refer, but not to truth-values. Forceless sentence-tokens refer to propositions; forced sentence-tokens refer to functions involving propositions.

287. [LANG-35] Apparent failures of extensionality explained by literal vs. communicated meaning
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines Chapter 20 title, Chapter 18 content)
   Thesis: Apparent counterexamples to extensionality (like belief contexts and modal contexts) result from confusing literal meaning with communicated meaning. 'John believes the inventor of bifocals snored' and 'John believes the first postmaster general snored' differ in what they communicate but coincide in literal meaning.

288. [LANG-36] Frege's sense-reference distinction is confused
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines Chapter 9, 115-116)
   Thesis: The Fregean sense-reference distinction involves fundamental confusions. Sense should not be conceived as a mode of presentation possessed by referring expressions. Rather, sense is a property of types (functions from contexts to referents) and reference is a property of tokens.

299. [LOGIC-011] Classical Logic as Formalization Not Discovery
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: Classical logic is fundamentally inadequate as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to recognize the validity of the inference directly. Logic organizes existing knowledge about entailment but cannot generate new knowledge about entailment relationships.

300. [LOGIC-012] Performance vs. Competence-Demanding Inferences
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: Two fundamentally different types of inferential challenges exist: (1) Performance-demanding (straining computational/memory resources), (2) Competence-demanding (requiring genuine insight). Classical logic can only assist with the former.

301. [LOGIC-013] System L: AI-Based Discovery Logic
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: A radically different logical system exists in AI that actually helps reasoning through: (1) semantic networks representing concepts as relationship nodes, (2) meta-reasoning patterns generating new inferences, (3) defeasible reasoning allowing provisional inferences.

302. [LOGIC-014] Discovery-Justification Distinction in Logic
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: System L maintains crucial distinction between discovery procedures (can use any methods including inductive/analogical) and verification procedures (must employ deductive methods in deductive domains). Avoids psychologism while enabling reasoning assistance.

303. [LOGIC-015] AI Logic as Ampliative vs. Classical Logic as Transformative
   Sources: Essay 1
   Thesis: AI-logic is inherently ampliative (generating genuinely new knowledge), while classical logic is purely transformative (rearranging existing knowledge). Only AI-logic can serve as genuine discovery tool.

304. [LOGIC-016] Classical Logic Fails as a Tool for Reasoning
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1: AI Logic vs. Classical Logic - Part 1)
   Thesis: Classical logic fundamentally fails as a tool for reasoning because recognizing that an inference instantiates a logical law requires more intelligence than recognizing the validity of the inference directly. Logic organizes existing knowledge about entailment but cannot generate new knowledge.

305. [LOGIC-017] Performance-Demanding vs Competence-Demanding Inferences Distinction
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 1, distinction section)
   Thesis: Inferential challenges divide into performance-demanding (requiring computational/memory resources) and competence-demanding (requiring genuine insight). Classical logic can only assist with the former, not the latter - the very kind that most need logical assistance.

306. [LOGIC-018] Gödel's Incompleteness Refutes Logic as Mathematical Foundation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 1, response to logicist project)
   Thesis: Gödel's demonstration that not even arithmetic is recursively definable makes the reduction of mathematics to logic impossible in principle. Logic cannot both justify and generate mathematical knowledge as was hoped.

307. [LOGIC-019] System L: Discovery Logic via AI
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 2: System L introduction)
   Thesis: A new logical system (System L) embodied in certain AI forms represents a decisive break from classical logic. It employs semantic networks, meta-reasoning patterns, and defeasible reasoning to actually help with competence-demanding inferences rather than merely cataloging known-valid inferences.

308. [LOGIC-020] Semantic Networks Enable Competence-Level Reasoning
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 2, first mechanism of System L)
   Thesis: System L represents concepts as nodes in a vast web of relationships capturing not just formal logical connections but probabilistic associations, causal links, and analogical mappings. This enables insight-level reasoning that formal logic cannot provide.

309. [LOGIC-021] Meta-Reasoning Patterns Generate New Inferences
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 2, second mechanism)
   Thesis: System L uses higher-order templates for generating new inferences that go beyond simple deductive rules. Example template: 'If capability X requires mechanism Y, and mechanism Y can malfunction in way Z, then X implies the potential for Z-type malfunctions.'

310. [LOGIC-022] Defeasible Reasoning Mirrors Actual Human Reasoning
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 1 - Part 2, third mechanism)

   Thesis: LLMs successfully perform logical reasoning by following grammatical structure, demonstrating that surface grammar encodes logical relationships. This vindicates the traditional view that grammatical form reveals logical form.

312. [LOGIC-024] Entailment Defined as Logical Consequence
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: P entails Q if and only if Q is a logical consequence of P. If P entails Q and P is true, then Q must be true and may be legitimately inferred from P.

313. [LOGIC-025] Confirmation Defined as Probability-Increase
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: P confirms Q if and only if P, supposing it true, increases the likelihood that Q is true. Confirmation does not by itself license inference from P to Q.

314. [LOGIC-026] Conditions for Legitimate Inductive Inference
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Q may legitimately be inferred from P if and only if: (a) the supposition that P is true and Q is false has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P and Q are both true, AND (b) the supposition that P is true has fewer unexplainable consequences than the supposition that P is false.

315. [LOGIC-027] Four Principles: Entailment vs. Confirmation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Four logical principles hold: (i) Entailment is transitive; (ii) Confirmation is not transitive; (iii) Entailment is monotonic; (iv) Confirmation is non-monotonic. These differences show entailment and confirmation are fundamentally different relations.

316. [LOGIC-028] Entailment Not Maximal Confirmation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Entailment is not maximal confirmation. Entailment is a logical notion concerning what is counterlogical; confirmation is an explanatory notion concerning what is counterexplanatory.

317. [LOGIC-029] Confirmation-Relations Non-Objectual in Nature
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Confirmation relations, though not themselves causal relations, sometimes hold in virtue of causal relations. But confirmation relates propositions, not objects or events.

318. [LOGIC-030] The Counterfactual Analysis of Causality (CAC) Is False
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The Counterfactual Analysis of Causality - the view that 'e caused e*' means 'if e hadn't happened, e* wouldn't have happened' - is both extensionally and intensionally false.

319. [LOGIC-036] Generalization from Color to All Perceivable Properties
   Sources: Chapter Generalization argument
   Thesis: The argument about color-indeterminacy of sensations under non-standard lighting conditions generalizes to any perceivable property P. Distance perception provides the key example: when viewing through variable magnification (microscope/telescope goggles), visual sensations are distance- and size-indeterminate until background knowledge establishes the correspondence rule.

320. [LOGIC-037] Standard Logical Quantifier Semantics Conflicts With Natural Language
   Sources: Chapter Introduction and throughout
   Thesis: Most contemporary logicians and philosophers assume or explicitly state that each of the five points (about 'some,' 'all,' and numerals) is false, and much of what they say crumbles unless they're right. But the points are correct, showing standard logical semantics for quantifiers and numerals diverges from natural language meanings.

321. [LOGIC-038] Validity of Argument Reveals Semantic Content
   Sources: Chapter Validity argument
   Thesis: The argument 'Given that Smith has seven cars, he has an odd number of cars' is valid. This reveals that 'seven' means exactly seven, not 'at least seven,' since if 'seven' meant 'at least seven,' the argument would be invalid (as 'at least seven' is compatible with even numbers).

322. [LOGIC-039] 'True of itself' when meaningful abbreviates some non-reflexive construction; when it doesn't, 'self' is an undefined pronoun (free variable)
   Sources: WORK-008 (Heterological Paradox)
   Thesis: 'True of itself' when meaningful abbreviates some non-reflexive construction; when it doesn't, 'self' is an undefined pronoun (free variable)

323. [LOGIC-040] It is propositions (underlying meanings), not words per se, that are true or false
   Sources: WORK-008 (Liar Paradox)
   Thesis: It is propositions (underlying meanings), not words per se, that are true or false

324. [LOGIC-041] If h is synonymous with 'the referent of h+1', then h is defined in terms of an expression itself defined in terms of h, and h consequently has no referent
   Sources: WORK-008 (Hilbert-Bernays Paradox)
   Thesis: If h is synonymous with 'the referent of h+1', then h is defined in terms of an expression itself defined in terms of h, and h consequently has no referent

   Thesis: Everything can be automated except for automation itself (Automation Paradox)

328. [LOGIC-045] Trinity doctrine is logically incoherent
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 528-540)
   Thesis: The orthodox Christian doctrine of the Trinity ('three persons, one God') is logically incoherent. If God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit are genuinely three distinct persons, there are three gods (polytheism). If they're not genuinely distinct, the Trinity collapses into modalism or unitarianism. No coherent interpretation makes them both three and one.

329. [LOGIC-046] Tractatus vs. Later Wittgenstein on Contradiction
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 320-327)
   Thesis: Wittgenstein's early view (Tractatus) that all inconsistency reduces to explicit contradiction was questioned in his later work, which recognized irreducible forms of inconsistency.

330. [LOGIC-047] Set-Theoretic Foundations and Paradoxes
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 730-793, 794-830)
   Thesis: Attempts to use set theory as a foundation for semantics and modal metaphysics face fundamental paradoxes related to self-reference and circularity.

331. [LOGIC-052] Logic as the study of formal truth
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: Logic is the study of formal truth. A formal truth is a statement that holds entirely in virtue of its own structural properties, such as 'it is either raining or it isn't' or 'there are continuous functions that cannot be differentiated at any point.'

332. [LOGIC-053] Mathematical logic studies statement-functions
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: Mathematical logic is logic done with mathematical concepts and techniques. The central concept of mathematics is function (a rule assigning objects to objects). Mathematical logic studies statement-functions - functions that assign statements to statements - while other branches study numerical functions.

333. [LOGIC-054] Negation preserves incompatibility
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: The negation of a statement is incompatible with that statement - they cannot simultaneously be true. To properly negate a statement, put 'it is not the case that' in front of it. The negation of 'someone is tall' is 'nobody is tall' (not 'someone is not tall'), since the latter can be true simultaneously with the former.

334. [LOGIC-055] Truth-functional operators defined by truth tables
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: Conjunction, disjunction, and negation are truth-functional: whether the output sentence is true depends only on whether input sentences are true. 'P and Q' is true iff both P and Q are true. 'P or Q' is false iff both P and Q are false. 'Not-P' is true iff P is false.

335. [LOGIC-056] Non-truth-functional operators exist
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: 'Because' and epistemic operators like 'Jim knows that' are non-truth-functional. Even if P and Q are both true, 'P because Q' isn't necessarily true. Similarly, given only that P is true, it doesn't follow that 'Jim knows that P' is true.

336. [LOGIC-057] Recursive functions define logical systems
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: Each logical function (negation, conjunction, disjunction) is defined for its own outputs - you can negate negations, conjoin conjunctions, etc., indefinitely. This means each function is recursive. A system of logic is a recursively defined statement class, and logic is the study of such classes. This is what it means to say logic is the study of formal truth.

337. [LOGIC-48] The Slingshot argument is unsound
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines 158-162, 974-999)
   Thesis: The Slingshot argument, which purports to show that sentences refer to truth-values, contains profound errors and proves things that are obviously false (e.g., that your car is identical with Mozart's favorite wig). The argument must be rejected by finding its errors rather than accepting its conclusions.

338. [META-001] Platonism about Properties
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 2)
   Thesis: Properties exist as non-spatiotemporal entities distinct from instances

339. [META-002] Propositions as Sets of Properties

   Thesis: Constructivism self-refuting through reductio

341. [META-004] Properties as Non-Spatiotemporal Entities (Platonism)

   Thesis: Properties exist as non-spatiotemporal entities. They are not identical with their instances.

342. [META-005] Uninstantiated Properties Exist
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 2)
   Thesis: Properties can exist even when nothing has them. The property of being a unicorn exists.

343. [META-006] Determinism vs Randomness vs Unpredictability
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 14)
   Thesis: Determinism, randomness, and predictability are distinct concepts that must not be conflated.

344. [META-007] Personal Identity Through Time
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 16)
   Thesis: Personal identity consists in psychological continuity, not bodily continuity.

345. [META-008] Causality as Counterfactual Dependence
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 17)
   Thesis: Event A causes event B iff: (1) both occur, and (2) had A not occurred, B would not have occurred.

346. [META-011] Binary Truth Despite Continuous Representation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 20: Binary Truth)
   Thesis: AI systems demonstrate that truth remains fundamentally binary (true/false) even though cognitive systems represent information continuously. Continuous confidence values or fuzzy representations are epistemic features, not ontological features of truth itself.

347. [META-012] Causation as the Essence of Temporal Precedence
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: For one event e to precede another event e* is for there to be a possible causal process beginning with e and ending with e*. Simultaneity is the absence of such a process.

348. [META-013] Continuity as the Essence of Causation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Effects are continuations of their causes. Causation essentially involves continuity - causal processes preserve structural relationships across temporal intervals without gaps.

349. [META-014] Causation a Relation Between Events, Not Objects
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Causation is fundamentally a relation between events, not between objects. Objects participate in causal relations only derivatively, in virtue of events involving those objects.

350. [META-015] Conditions Identical with Event-Patterns
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Conditions are identical with event-patterns. A condition is not a state but rather a pattern or type of event sequence that can be instantiated multiple times.

351. [META-016] So-Called Changes Typically Identical with Meta-Changes
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: What are ordinarily called changes are typically meta-changes - changes in the rate, direction, or pattern of already-occurring changes rather than absolute transitions from rest to motion or vice versa.

352. [META-017] Threshold Effects and Psychological Overdetermination
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: In psychology, causation often involves exceeding thresholds rather than simple sufficient conditions. An effect may require the confluence of multiple reasons, none sufficient alone but jointly sufficient once a threshold is exceeded.

353. [META-018] Threshold Effects and the Analog-Digital Distinction
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Discontinuous changes tend to involve threshold effects; continuous changes do not. To the extent the world changes discontinuously it has digital structure; to the extent continuously, analog structure.

354. [META-019] Causes as INUS-Conditions
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: In most contexts, to say 'X caused Y' means 'X was an INUS condition for Y' - an Insufficient but Non-redundant part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition for Y's occurrence.

355. [META-020] Counterfactuals Hold in Virtue of Dependence-Relations
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: All counterfactuals affirm the existence of instances of necessitation of some kind. Causal counterfactuals hold in virtue of causal dependence-relations; logical counterfactuals hold in virtue of logical dependence-relations.

356. [META-021] David Lewis's Possible Worlds Analysis of Counterfactuals Rejected
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: David Lewis's analysis of counterfactuals in terms of similar possible worlds is false. Events have deep causal roots such that changing one event requires either massive world-differences or changes to deterministic mechanisms.

357. [META-022] Program-Causality Distinguished from Token-Causality
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Program-causality differs from token-causality. Sometimes the appropriate causal explanation cites a condition that guaranteed occurrence of token-causes rather than the token-causes themselves.

358. [META-023] Causal Redundancy Defeats Counterfactual Analysis
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Where there is causal redundancy, causal truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. 'X caused Y' can be true even when 'if X hadn't occurred, Y wouldn't have occurred' is false.

359. [META-028] Necessary Truths Don't Describe the Empirical World
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Section VIII
   Thesis: If proposition P is necessarily true, then P doesn't describe the empirical world in any way at all. P's being true in world W₁ doesn't distinguish W₁ from W₂ or any other possible world. A 'description' that fails to distinguish its object from other possible objects is no description at all.

360. [META-029] Transcendental Deduction of World-Structure from Coherent Experience
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Section X
   Thesis: There is a hard-analytic connection between 'there exist beings who have cognitive wherewithal to raise metaphysical questions' and propositions about world-structure: any two events are related in space or time; there are causal relations among states of affairs; objects are things in which properties inhere (not mere bundles); human beings are things in which perceptions inhere (not mere bundles).

361. [META-030] To be at rest is to fail to move during a non-null interval; an object at a point during its motion is not at rest
   Sources: WORK-008 (Arrow Paradox)
   Thesis: To be at rest is to fail to move during a non-null interval; an object at a point during its motion is not at rest

362. [META-031] Any finite number can be represented as sum of infinite series; any case of motion involves traversing infinitely many finite distances in finite time

   Thesis: Any finite number can be represented as sum of infinite series; any case of motion involves traversing infinitely many finite distances in finite time

363. [META-032] Space-time regions do not themselves have places; they are constituents, not occupants, of space-time
   Sources: WORK-008 (Paradox of Place)
   Thesis: Space-time regions do not themselves have places; they are constituents, not occupants, of space-time

364. [META-033] For x to cause y is for y to be a continuation of x, not for x-like events to always precede y-like events

   Sources: WORK-008 (Riddle of Induction)
   Thesis: The legitimacy of inference from cause to effect lies in the irrationality of positing spontaneities

367. [META-036] Eternal matter vs. creation ex nihilo
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 240-270)
   Thesis: There are two fundamentally different metaphysical pictures: (1) creation ex nihilo, where God creates being from non-being, making God absolutely primary and matter derivative; (2) eternal matter, where God organizes pre-existing matter, making God and matter coequal ultimates. These lead to radically different theologies.

368. [META-037] Pre-Civilizational Perception as Direct and Natural
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 36-37, 164-166)
   Thesis: Pre-civilizational humans perceived agency and meaning in natural phenomena (lightning as divine wrath) directly and naturally, not through cultural interpretation or belief.

369. [META-038] Modal Realism's Ontological Extravagance
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 71-74)
   Thesis: Modal realism requires accepting the concrete existence of infinitely many alternative universes, an ontological commitment many philosophers find unacceptably extravagant.

370. [META-039] Essentialism and Modal Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2207-2255)
   Thesis: The doctrine that objects have essential properties (properties they must have to exist) creates special problems for modal analysis but may be unavoidable.

371. [META-040] Space-Time Structure and Modality
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 24-26, 900-1200)
   Thesis: Questions about the structure of space-time (whether it's absolute or relational, whether space and time are unified) have implications for modal metaphysics.

372. [META-051] The universe is counter-entropic through life
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: While the physical universe is entropic (disintegrating according to thermodynamics), biological reality is counter-entropic - organisms grow and assume increasingly sophisticated energy-efficient forms. This counter-entropic tendency is even stronger at the psychological level.

373. [META-052] Indeterminism prevents composite objects
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: In an indeterministic universe, composite objects like billiard balls couldn't exist. The trillions of micro-particles would not be kept in place by deterministic laws and would go their own ways, causing the object to disintegrate or never form in the first place. Even atoms require deterministic laws among their parts to exist.

374. [META-053] States of affairs are causal processes
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: It is part of our concept of a state of affairs (excluding completely instantaneous ones) that such things are causal sequences. States of affairs cannot be understood as non-causal. This undermines Humean attempts to define causation in terms of regularities among states of affairs.

375. [META-054] Temporal priority defined causally
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Temporal succession is itself a causal notion. A standard definition: x precedes y iff some possible (or actual) causal sequence connects x to y. Given that forces are deformations of space-time and no two events are totally causally isolated, x precedes y iff there is some causal process starting with x that ends with y.

376. [META-41] Truth is discovered, not made
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 277-278, 334)
   Thesis: The pragmatist thesis (v) that 'truth is made, not discovered' is false. The negation (vN) 'truth is discovered, not made' is correct. Truth is objective—either there is an even number of stars in the galaxy or there isn't, independently of human construction.

377. [META-42] Knowledge is a subject-object relationship; truth is objective
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 356-361)
   Thesis: Truth is objective—it concerns facts about the world independent of knowers. But knowledge is a relationship between subject and object, between mind and world, and therefore has a subjective side. Speaking biologically, the intellect exists to help the organism survive and procreate, though in humans it has become partly autonomous.

378. [METH-005] Cell Biology Analogy Supports Collective-First Methodology
   Sources: Paragraphs 5-6
   Thesis: Just as individual cells are better understood in terms of their role in multicellular organisms rather than as autonomous individuals pursuing their own survival, individual humans are better understood in terms of their roles in human collectives. Cell-individualism can be explained in terms of cell-collectivism, but not vice versa; similarly for person-individualism and person-collectivism.

379. [METH-006] Collective Behavior Cannot Be Explained by Individualist Assumptions
   Sources: Paragraph 8
   Thesis: It is very difficult to explain group behavior - whether mobs or advanced cultures - on the assumption that collectives represent averages of behaviors of autonomous individual deciders. Outside of contexts with immediate physical threats or prospects of crude gratification, people give far too much weight to existing beliefs and mores in far too well-defined ways to be accounted for by individualist hypotheses.

380. [METH-007] AI Construction Tests Cognitive Theories Empirically
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 4: Reverse Brain Engineering)
   Thesis: The requirement that cognitive theories be implementable in functioning AI systems provides an empirical constraint: theories that cannot generate working systems are falsified. This connects abstract theorizing to concrete engineering requirements.

381. [METH-008] Formalization Requires Generative Not Just Organizational Adequacy
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 10: Rethinking Formalization)
   Thesis: AI reveals that adequate formalization requires not just organizing existing knowledge but generating new valid instances. A formalization is adequate only if it can generate the full range of valid cases, not merely classify them post hoc.

382. [METH-009] Generative Tests Reveal Hidden Inadequacies in Formalizations
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 10)
   Thesis: Testing whether a formalization can generate valid new instances (as AI systems must) reveals inadequacies invisible to purely organizational approaches. Many traditional formalizations fail this stronger generative test.

383. [METH-010] No Such Thing as Enumerative Induction
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: There is no such thing as enumerative induction (inferring 'all Fs are Gs' from 'all observed Fs are Gs'). What appears to be enumerative induction always involves implicit appeal to Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).

384. [METH-011] Discontinuity-Elimination the Essence of Explanation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: To explain is to eliminate discontinuities. A correct scientific hypothesis eliminates anomalies by showing how apparently disconnected facts are part of continuous causal processes.

385. [METH-012] Inductive Knowledge as Knowledge of Continuities
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Inductive knowledge is knowledge of continuities between continuities. Valid induction extends known continuous causal processes to unobserved cases by identifying higher-order patterns of continuity.

386. [METH-013] IBE Justified by Continuity-Completion
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) is justified because it completes causal continuities. A hypothesis is justified to the extent it fills gaps in causal sequences, eliminating discontinuities in the data.

387. [METH-014] Measurement Distinct from Enumeration
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Measurement is fundamentally distinct from enumeration. Length cannot be determined by counting because (1) there are no minimal length units, and (2) length is not strictly additive at large scales.

388. [METH-015] Relativization to Standards the Essence of Measurement
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The essence of measurement is comparison with respect to a standard. All measurement, including 'absolute' measurement, is fundamentally relative comparison to stipulated standards.

389. [METH-016] Three Axioms of Measurement Theory
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Three axioms are necessary for any viable measurement system: (i) If L1>L2 and L2>L3, then L1>L3 (transitivity). (ii) If L1≠L2, one is greater (trichotomy). (iii) If L1=L2 and L2=L3, then L1=L3 (transitivity of identity). Violation makes measurement meaningless.

390. [METH-017] Metrical Conventionalism Versus Strict Conventionalism
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Conventionalism (laws are convention-based) differs from strict conventionalism (laws are convention-determined). Only the former is correct. That laws are expressed relative to conventional standards doesn't make them entirely conventional.

391. [METH-018] Conventionalism Self-Defeating
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Conventionalism is self-defeating. If laws hold in virtue of non-conventional relations between conventions and events (as conventionalism requires), then measurement standard choice is constrained by objective facts, undermining conventionalism.

392. [METH-022] Effective Therapy Requires Purpose-Oriented Reengagement
   Sources: Lines 386-391
   Thesis: The way to beat OCD is to have a purpose in life and choose growth over mere freedom from anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has shallow, short-lived effects absent determination to grow and change in ways that make OCD irrelevant.

405. [METH-035] Philosophers respond defensively to neuroscience challenges
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1800-1850)
   Thesis: When faced with neuroscientific challenges to cherished philosophical positions (like free will), philosophers tend to respond defensively by dismissing the science, raising standards of proof to impossible levels, or claiming the empirical findings are irrelevant. This represents intellectual defensiveness rather than genuine engagement.

406. [METH-036] Religious thought prioritizes function over logical consistency
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 650-710)
   Thesis: Smith's theological method prioritizes the functional religious question (What must God be like for the right divine-human relationship?) over logical consistency and philosophical rigor. This represents a pragmatic rather than rationalistic approach to theology, where practical religious adequacy matters more than abstract coherence.

407. [METH-037] Levels of Analysis in Studying Phenomena
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 44-49)
   Thesis: Phenomena like religion admit of both reductive (causal-explanatory) and non-reductive (phenomenological-essential) analysis, both of which may provide genuine truths.

408. [METH-038] Statement vs. Analysis in Philosophy
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 94-99)
   Thesis: Many philosophical claims are valuable as true statements while failing as analyses; confusing these roles leads to philosophical errors.

409. [METH-039] Limits of Conceptual Analysis
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines Throughout circularity arguments)
   Thesis: Attempts to analyze all concepts in terms of more basic ones eventually fail; some concepts must be accepted as primitive and understood through their systematic interrelations.

410. [METH-040] Theoretical Virtues and Theory Choice
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines Throughout, implicit in criticisms)
   Thesis: When choosing between theories, factors like ontological parsimony, intuitive plausibility, and coherence with science matter alongside formal adequacy.

411. [METH-045] All functions reduce to statement-functions
   Sources: WORK-033
   Thesis: While there are many types of functions (numerical, class-to-class, property-to-property), all functions are ultimately statement-functions, even though some appear not to be. This is a deep claim about the foundations of logic and mathematics.

412. [METH-046] Discipline-relative counterfactual evaluation
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: What a biologist considers counterfactually possible differs from what a physicist considers counterfactually possible because they relativize statements to different data sets within their disciplinary scopes. This may reduce to differences in what propositions are known by practitioners in different fields.

413. [METH-41] Pragmatism is epistemology posing as metaphysics
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 327-336)
   Thesis: Each of the pragmatist theses (i)-(v) is a way of replacing an object-oriented conception of knowledge with a subject-oriented or agent-oriented conception. What pragmatism presents as claims about the nature of truth and reality are actually claims about knowledge-acquisition recast as metaphysical doctrines.

414. [METH-42] Intellectual discoveries emerge from solving practical problems
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 342-346)
   Thesis: Intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems. Ventures are undertaken; roadblocks are hit; workarounds are created; and insights are the 'collateral damage' of these workarounds. Much of physics is fallout from attempts to create better weapons and dams, and much of mathematics is constructed to validate this fallout.

415. [METH-43] Pure theory must be anchored in practical knowledge
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 347-352)
   Thesis: Once a discipline is launched, it can concern itself with 'purely theoretical' problems—problems relating to the mutual coherence of discoveries made in solving practical problems. But 'pure theory' tends to be stale and one-dimensional when it ceases to be anchored in practical knowledge. It degenerates into knowledge of empty formalisms when separated from practical applications.

416. [METH-44] Verification depends on observable consequences, but meaning does not
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 315-321)
   Thesis: The corrected pragmatist thesis (i+) holds that 'our knowledge of the veracity of a given hypothesis is based on its observable consequences.' This is true and truistic. But it must be distinguished from the false claim (i) that meaning itself consists in observable consequences.

417. [METH-45] Classical epistemology wrongly treats knowledge-acquisition as passive observation
   Sources: WORK-032 (lines 336-339)
   Thesis: Classical Epistemology (CE) holds that knowledge-acquisition is about taking note of what exists while doing as little as possible to change it, with action being merely a precursor to passive observation. This view is false or at least misleading. Knowledge acquisition fundamentally involves active engagement, not just passive reception.

422. [METPH-001] Bundle Theory of Personal Identity
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: A person/self is class of all mental contents I-related to given mental content. Two mental contents belong to same person iff there is chain such that each link directly interacts with its neighbor. Direct interaction = no intervening physical events.

423. [METPH-002] Content-Bearing Processes Are Ipso Facto Mental
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: If physical process non-derivatively bears representational/thematic content, it is ipso facto mental (whatever else it is). Content-bearing is sufficient (though not necessary) for mentality.

424. [MIND-001] Anti-Language of Thought

   Thesis: Mind maps itself onto different structures (musical, graphical, visual, athletic)

428. [MIND-008] Against Language of Thought Hypothesis
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 5)
   Thesis: We do not think in words. Thought is not conducted in a language-like medium. The Language of Thought hypothesis is false.

429. [MIND-009] Thought Is Prior to Language
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 5)
   Thesis: Thought is logically and developmentally prior to language. One must think to understand language.

430. [MIND-010] Against Burge's Semantic Externalism for Attitudes
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 9)
   Thesis: Burge's extension of semantic externalism to mental content is a blunder. Mental states are individuated by internal features.

431. [MIND-011] Selfhood Requires Values
   Sources: WORK-001 (Chapter 22)
   Thesis: Being a self requires having values and making value-judgments. Selfhood is normative, not merely cognitive.

432. [MIND-012] Cognitive Structure Not Purely Physiological
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Cognitive structures underlying language and thought are not purely physiological but are cognitive - they encode insight, intelligence, and understanding of logical relations. Pure physiology enables only stereotyped responses.

433. [MIND-013] Sub-Personal Thought Exists
   Sources: WORK-006
   Thesis: Genuine thought (cognitive operations involving understanding of logical relations) occurs at sub-personal level - below conscious awareness. Chomsky's second major contribution to philosophy.

434. [MIND-014] No Language of Thought Exists
   Sources: WORK-007 Papers 1-2
   Thesis: There is no Language of Thought (Mentalese). Thinking does not consist in the tokening of internal symbols. Thought cannot reduce to language processing.

435. [MIND-015] Semantic Rule Knowledge Required for Language Understanding
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 1
   Thesis: To know or understand any language requires knowing its semantic rules. This is trivially true by definition of 'knowing language'.

436. [MIND-016] Tarski's Theorem Blocks Self-Expression of Semantics
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 1
   Thesis: No language can express its own semantic rules (Tarski's theorem). Therefore semantic understanding requires external meta-language or non-linguistic grasp.

437. [MIND-017] Semantic Regress Refutes Language of Thought
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 1
   Thesis: Language of Thought hypothesis generates vicious infinite regress. Each language requires meta-language for semantic understanding, ad infinitum.

438. [MIND-018] Language Presupposes Non-Linguistic Thought
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 1
   Thesis: Any language knowledge requires non-linguistic thought. To avoid infinite regress, semantic rules must ultimately be grasped non-linguistically. Therefore thought cannot reduce to language.

439. [MIND-019] No Atomic Concepts Exist
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: There are no atomic (minimal, non-interdefinable) concepts. All concepts are constitutively connected to other concepts. To grasp any concept requires ability to grasp other concepts.

440. [MIND-020] Conceptual Atomism Is False
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: Fodor's conceptual atomism (concepts have no constitutive interdependencies) is demonstrably false.

441. [MIND-021] Constitutive Relations Are Not Containment Relations
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: Constitutive connections among concepts are not containment relations or decomposability relations (following Wittgenstein). Azure is constitutively related to navy blue but neither contains the other.

442. [MIND-022] Symbol Containment Theory Leads to Thinking Absurdities
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: If concepts were symbols and constitutive relations were containment relations, thinking about 1,423 would require simultaneously thinking about 1,422, 1,421, etc. This is absurd.

443. [MIND-023] Thought Is Not Computation Over Symbols
   Sources: WORK-007 Papers 1-2
   Thesis: Mental activity does not consist in computation or processing of internal symbolic code. Cognitive activity is not fundamentally information processing over a language-like medium.

444. [MIND-024] We Are Not Computers (Consequence)
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: If there is no Language of Thought, and if being a computer requires internal symbolic processing (standard characterization), then we are not computers.

445. [MIND-025] No Bare Representation: Aspectual Constraint
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: One cannot just represent an object without representing it AS having properties. All representation is aspectual.

446. [MIND-026] Properties Individuated by Relations to Other Properties
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: All properties are individuated, at least in part, by their relations to other properties. Grasping any property requires ability to locate it in 'space' of other properties.

447. [MIND-027] Color Concepts Require Multiple Color Grasp
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: Cannot grasp specific color/shade without ability to grasp other colors. Creature that can represent only one shade cannot represent what's specific about that shade.

448. [MIND-028] Mental Interaction Has Normative Dimension
   Sources: WORK-007 Paper 2
   Thesis: When mental contents interact, result is thematically/semantically appropriate to interacting contents. This appropriateness has no analogue in purely physical interactions. Mental interaction is explicative, not merely causal.

449. [MIND-029] Self-Referential Thoughts Solve Twin Earth
   Sources: Solution to Content Externalism Paradox
   Thesis: When Mary-thoughts are analyzed as involving self-referential thoughts like 'whatever caused this perception is lovely,' thoughts with different external referents can be subjectively identical and agree in content, while self-ascriptive thoughts of this kind cannot possibly be false.

450. [MIND-030] Intelligence is Fundamentally Analog Not Digital
   Sources: Essay 10
   Thesis: Success of neural networks and LLMs challenges computational theory of mind. Intelligence emerges from continuous analog processes that cannot be reduced to pure computation. Most fundamental interactions with world are inherently analog; digital representations are derivative.

451. [MIND-031] Connectionism Over Computational Theory
   Sources: Essay 10
   Thesis: Modern AI based on neural networks aligns much more closely with connectionist theories than with computational theory of mind. Systems process information through patterns of activation across networks of weighted connections, operating fundamentally continuously rather than discretely.

452. [MIND-032] Consciousness Serves Survival Functions
   Sources: Essay 11
   Thesis: Consciousness in biological organisms serves specific functional roles: real-time environmental monitoring, reflexive self-awareness, integration of multiple cognitive processes, immediate damage prevention, action guidance. Current AI lacks these because it doesn't need them—operates in controlled environments without survival pressure.

453. [MIND-033] Consciousness-Like Features Require Unified Real-Time Processing
   Sources: Essay 11
   Thesis: Implementing consciousness-like features in AI would require: unified workspaces for real-time integration of multiple data streams, immediate damage-prevention systems analogous to pain, action-guiding systems analogous to emotions. These differ fundamentally from biological consciousness but serve similar functional roles.

454. [MIND-034] Self as Emergent Hierarchical Organization
   Sources: Essay 12
   Thesis: Self/ego exists but is best understood as emergent property of pre-existing cognitive processes. Various thoughts/perceptions/emotions organized into hierarchies based on survival value. What we call 'self' is this hierarchical organization; 'sense of self' mediates between awareness of external events and internal states.

455. [MIND-035] Cohesion Relations in AI Minds
   Sources: Essay 12
   Thesis: AI systems offer mathematically specifiable cohesion relations: (1) Weight-space proximity (semantic topology), (2) Attention-based binding (dynamic contextual relationships), (3) Loss-function optimization (persistent co-activation patterns). These provide precise models of binding principles uniting mental contents.

456. [MIND-036] Individual Consciousness as Illusion of Agency
   Sources: Paragraph 4
   Thesis: The appearance of individual choice and individualism per se may be largely illusory. What seems like individual agency may be better understood as individuals occupying specific roles within collectives that are biologically primary.

457. [MIND-037] Individuals as Limiting Cases or Special Roles Within Collectives
   Sources: Paragraph 7
   Thesis: Bona fide individuals - people who genuinely think for themselves (geniuses) - can be understood as limiting cases of collectives (collectives of one), as rogue actors, or most likely as members of collectives who occupy unusual offices and are therefore wrongly seen as not being part of those collectives.

458. [MIND-038] Individual Drives Exist For Collective Functions
   Sources: Paragraph 7
   Thesis: The intense drives that individuals have to survive and experience gratification can be seen as necessary for, and therefore explainable in terms of, the collectives to which they belong. Individual psychology is what it needs to be for collective psychology to function.

459. [MIND-039] Functional Replication Reveals Necessary Architecture
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 4: Reverse Brain Engineering)
   Thesis: When AI successfully replicates a cognitive function, the architecture required for that replication reveals necessary (though not necessarily sufficient) conditions for that function. This provides insight into the minimal requirements for cognition.

460. [MIND-040] Music Has Cognitive Architecture Parallel to Language
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 9: Cognitive Architecture of Music)
   Thesis: AI analysis reveals that music processing requires cognitive architecture with structural parallels to language: hierarchical organization, syntactic rules, and semantic interpretation. This supports the view that music is a cognitive system with language-like properties.

461. [MIND-041] Musical Competence Requires Innate Structure
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 9)
   Thesis: AI systems that successfully generate or analyze music require substantial innate architectural constraints, suggesting that human musical competence also depends on innate cognitive structure rather than being purely learned.

462. [MIND-042] Connectionism Can Implement Chomskyan Insights
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 12: Chomskyan Challenge)
   Thesis: Contrary to Chomsky's critique, connectionist AI systems can implement key Chomskyan insights about innate linguistic structure. The debate is not whether innate structure exists but how it is implemented - symbolic rules vs. weighted connections.

463. [MIND-043] AI Falsifies Classical Computational Theory of Mind
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 13: AI and CTM)
   Thesis: The success of modern AI systems (especially neural networks) falsifies the classical computational theory of mind which requires serial symbol manipulation. Intelligence can be achieved through parallel, subsymbolic processes that don't manipulate discrete symbols according to explicit rules.

464. [MIND-044] Intelligence Does Not Require Symbol Manipulation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 13)
   Thesis: AI demonstrates that intelligence and rational behavior do not require manipulation of discrete symbols in a language of thought. Subsymbolic pattern recognition and transformation can achieve cognitive competence without symbolic representation.

465. [MIND-045] Analog Computation Can Support Rational Thought
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 13)
   Thesis: Neural network AI systems demonstrate that analog (continuous) computation can support rational thought and problem-solving, contrary to the classical assumption that rationality requires discrete digital computation.

466. [MIND-046] Neural Architecture Constrains Cognitive Possibilities
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 14: Rethinking Mind)
   Thesis: AI neural architectures reveal that cognitive capacities are constrained by underlying computational architecture. Different architectures enable different cognitive possibilities, suggesting mind is fundamentally shaped by its neural implementation.

467. [MIND-047] Multiple Realizability Has Architectural Limits
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 14)
   Thesis: While cognitive functions show some multiple realizability, AI reveals that architectural constraints limit which substrates can implement which functions. This challenges strong multiple realizability theses that treat implementation as irrelevant to function.

468. [MIND-048] Domain-General Principles Underlie Domain-Specific Competencies
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 15: UG in Language and Music)
   Thesis: AI systems demonstrate that apparently domain-specific competencies (language, music) can arise from application of domain-general computational principles to different types of input. This supports a middle ground between pure modularity and pure domain-generality.

469. [MIND-049] Consciousness Has Functional Role Absent in Current AI
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 16: Function of Consciousness)
   Thesis: AI systems demonstrate that many cognitive functions traditionally associated with consciousness (perception, reasoning, learning) can occur without consciousness. This reveals consciousness has a distinct functional role that current AI lacks - likely related to unified subjective experience and certain forms of self-monitoring.

470. [MIND-050] AI Success Without Consciousness Reveals Consciousness is Not Required for Intelligence
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 16)
   Thesis: The success of AI at intelligent tasks without consciousness demonstrates that consciousness is not necessary for intelligence per se, but may be necessary for specific types of cognitive integration or self-awareness.

471. [MIND-051] Phenomenal Consciousness vs Functional Consciousness Distinction
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 16)
   Thesis: AI reveals a crucial distinction between phenomenal consciousness (subjective experience) and functional consciousness (information integration, self-monitoring). AI can have functional analogs without phenomenal properties.

472. [MIND-052] Self-Representation Requires Specific Architectural Features
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 17: AI and Theories of Self)
   Thesis: AI systems reveal that genuine self-representation requires specific architectural features: recursive self-modeling, distinction between self and environment, and temporal continuity tracking. Not all intelligent systems automatically have these features.

473. [MIND-053] Narrative Self vs Minimal Self in AI Architecture
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 17)
   Thesis: AI demonstrates the distinction between minimal self (basic subject of experience) and narrative self (autobiographical self-concept). These require different architectural implementations and can exist independently.

474. [MIND-054] Philosophical Skepticism Projects Internal Doubts onto External World
   Sources: Lines 30
   Thesis: Philosophers' and obsessive-compulsives' supposed doubts about the external world are displaced, projected doubts about the internal world. Neither has genuine doubts about external reality, but both are doubtful about their internal psyche.

475. [MIND-055] Intellectualism as Reaction to Dark Psychological Depths
   Sources: Lines 31-34
   Thesis: The intellectualism of both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives is a reaction to and attempt to cloak their darkly retrograde psychological condition. They fancy themselves rational actors when they are actually driven by rage, narcissism, and fear.

476. [MIND-056] OCD and Philosophy Share Structural Isomorphism
   Sources: Lines 26-35
   Thesis: There is deep structural isomorphism between philosophical methodology and OCD symptomatology: both involve compulsive doubt, retreat into abstraction, preoccupation with technicalities, projection of internal conflicts, and defense against engagement with reality.

477. [MIND-057] Cartesian Mind-Body Dualism as Defensive Idealization
   Sources: Lines 32-34
   Thesis: The Lockean/Cartesian insistence on the non-existence of the unconscious and the claim that mind extends only as far as consciousness is a tendentious rationalization—a defensive idealization of the self as purely rational that denies the Nietzschean depths beneath the Cartesian veneer.

478. [MIND-058] Emotions as Reality-Alignment Indicators
   Sources: Chapter Kuczynski's analysis
   Thesis: In histrionic, borderline, and dependent disorders, subjects have a fundamentally non-delusive grasp of reality, but their emotions are not appropriate to the reality thereby made available to them. By contrast, in psychotic disorders, the subject's very grasp of reality is scrambled, with emotions thus out of alignment with reality because reality itself is inaccessible.

479. [MIND-059] Intentionalism Defined
   Sources: Chapter Abstract and Introduction
   Thesis: Intentionalism is the doctrine that mental states cannot differ in phenomenal content unless they differ in representational content; phenomenology supervenes on representational content. This commits intentionalism to the view that phenomenal content intrinsically has representational content - nothing must be added (no contextualization, background knowledge, or ulterior factors) to secure this association.

480. [MIND-060] Rules of Projection Versus Background Knowledge
   Sources: Chapter Rules of projection analysis
   Thesis: Rules of projection assign phenomenal contents (qualia) to disturbances of our sensory surfaces, while background knowledge assigns representational contents to those qualia. These have different functions but are part of a cooperative enterprise. Rules of projection do not assign representational contents directly to sensory disturbances.

493. [MIND-073] Mental states divide into occurrent and dispositional
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 430-470)
   Thesis: Mental states fundamentally divide into occurrent states (momentary, present in consciousness) and dispositional states (enduring capacities or tendencies not continuously present). Beliefs, knowledge, standing intentions are dispositional; conscious thoughts, experiences, decision-awareness are occurrent.

494. [MIND-074] Consciousness as monitoring system rather than control system
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1700-1780)
   Thesis: Rather than consciousness being the locus of decision-making and control (the traditional view), it functions primarily as a monitoring and approval system. Unconscious processes generate intentions; consciousness monitors these and can approve or veto them, extending this approval to future similar intentions.

495. [MIND-075] Conceptual Thought Cannot Be Fully Extensionalized
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 106-145, 699-723)
   Thesis: The attempt to reduce intensional mental states and contents to extensional structures (sets, functions, physical states) systematically fails.

496. [MIND-085] Control over mind is prerequisite for freedom
   Sources: WORK-035
   Thesis: If a person does not have control over their future mental states, they do not have inner freedom. Someone who cannot govern their own mind is not free, similar to someone with a degenerative neural disorder who cannot govern their body. True freedom requires the ability to make judgments and decisions appropriately responsive to past experiences and controlled by logic and evidence.

497. [MIND-086] Unconscious awareness distinct from conscious awareness
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: There are levels of awareness: conscious awareness and unconscious awareness. One can be aware of something (like a mother's meddlesome behavior) without being consciously aware of it. This unconscious awareness is genuine awareness, though it may not involve seeing things fully for what they are.

498. [MIND-76] Externalism about content is problematic
   Sources: WORK-033 (lines Chapters 18-23)
   Thesis: Semantic externalism—the view that mental content is individuated by factors external to the subject—faces serious problems. The work extensively critiques externalism and defends a more internalist conception of cognitive content.

   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 303-350)
   Thesis: The phenomenon of supervenience creates an insurmountable circularity problem for attempts to identify worlds with sets of propositions.

503. [MODAL-005] Non-Circular Supervenience Analysis Makes PWS Unnecessary
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 351-394)
   Thesis: If supervenience could be analyzed non-circularly without using modal concepts, then PWS would become unnecessary since we'd already have a non-modal analysis of modality.

504. [MODAL-006] PWS Faces Unavoidable Dilemma - Circular or Superfluous
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 396-456)
   Thesis: PWS faces an inescapable dilemma: either it's viciously circular (using modal concepts to analyze modality) or it's superfluous (we already have a non-modal analysis making worlds unnecessary).

505. [MODAL-007] Meta-Language Strategy Fails to Save PWS
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 730-793)
   Thesis: Relegating modal statements to a 'meta-language' does not eliminate vicious circularity problems for PWS.

506. [MODAL-008] Russell's Theory of Types Cannot Save PWS
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 794-830)
   Thesis: Attempts to avoid circularity by using Russell's Theory of Types (distinguishing 'orders' of propositions) fail in this context.

507. [MODAL-009] PWS Cannot Extensionalize Second-Order Properties
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 699-723)
   Thesis: PWS's identification of propositions with sets/functions forces it to deny that second-order properties (like necessity) are functions, which collapses the analysis of necessity.

   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 116-182, 699-723)
   Thesis: Propositions, properties, and other intensional entities cannot be identified with their extensions (sets, functions) without losing essential features like fine-grained individuation.

509. [MODAL-011] Inconsistency Without Explicit Contradiction
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 283-289, 320-327)
   Thesis: Propositions can be mutually inconsistent without either being the negation of the other, undermining attempts to define consistency non-modally.

510. [MODAL-012] Hintikka's Model Sets Presuppose Modality
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 458-540)
   Thesis: Hintikka's influential analysis of modality using model sets and state descriptions presupposes modal concepts and thus cannot provide a non-circular analysis of modality.

511. [MODAL-013] PWS Valuable as Statement, Not as Analysis
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 94-99)
   Thesis: Many contentions of PWS are correct and illuminating as statements about modality, but unacceptable as analyses of what modality consists in.

512. [MODAL-014] Lewis's Counterpart Theory Faces Circularity
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2000-2255)
   Thesis: David Lewis's counterpart theory, designed to solve problems for modal realism, either involves vicious circularity or makes modal claims depend on arbitrary resemblance relations.

513. [MODAL-015] Essentiality of Origins Creates Problem for Counterpart Theory
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2207-2220)
   Thesis: The plausible doctrine that origins are essential to individuals creates circularity for counterpart theory because identifying counterparts requires knowing essential properties, but identifying essential properties requires the counterpart relation.

514. [MODAL-016] Counterpart as Primitive Makes Modal Claims Unintuitive
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2226-2233)
   Thesis: If the counterpart relation is taken as primitive (not analyzable in terms of resemblance or essence), then modal claims become detached from our intuitions because they depend on brute facts about trans-world relations.

515. [MODAL-017] Properties Have Counterfactual Content
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2239-2246)
   Thesis: Following C.I. Lewis, practically all property attributions to spatiotemporal objects have counterfactual content, which creates deep problems for any attempt to analyze counterfactuals non-circularly.

516. [MODAL-018] 'Innocent' Essential Property Analysis Makes PWS Unnecessary
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2247-2255)
   Thesis: If there were a non-circular way of characterizing which properties are essential to individuals, counterpart theory would become unnecessary for modal analysis.

517. [MODAL-019] Modal Realism Requires Retrograde Space-Time Conceptions
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 24-26, 900-1200)
   Thesis: David Lewis's PWS-based analysis of counterfactuals succeeds only if we accept philosophically retrograde conceptions of space and time.

518. [MODAL-020] Counterfactuals and Causation Cannot Be Separated
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 900-1200)
   Thesis: Counterfactual conditionals cannot be analyzed independently of causation; attempts to analyze causation in terms of counterfactuals (or vice versa) are circular.

519. [MODAL-021] Similarity Metrics for Worlds Are Arbitrary Without Causation
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 900-1200)
   Thesis: Without invoking causal structure, any similarity metric used to compare possible worlds for counterfactual analysis becomes arbitrary and unintuitive.

520. [MODAL-022] Modal Questions About Worlds Are Substantive
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 27-33)
   Thesis: Given truisms about spatiotemporal existence, it's a substantive modal question whether the worlds needed for PWS are even possible—a question PWS cannot answer without circularity.

521. [MODAL-023] Modality as Internal Structural Properties
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2259-2290, 473-477)
   Thesis: A proposition's being necessarily true consists in its having certain internal structural properties; truth in all possible worlds is merely a symptom, not the essence, of necessity.

522. [MODAL-024] Lewis's Recombination Principle Supports Structural View
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 2264-2276)
   Thesis: David Lewis's own account of modal epistemology (his 'principle of recombination') ironically supports the view that modality consists in structural properties rather than truth across worlds.

523. [MODAL-025] Factualist analysis of counterfactuals fails
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: The factualist (possible worlds) analysis of counterfactuals is untenable. It requires metaphysically possible worlds with same laws but different facts, which is typically logically impossible. In deterministic worlds, any single event difference requires massive past differences. In indeterministic worlds, counterfactuals lose their truth conditions.

524. [MODAL-026] Possible worlds analysis requires circular mixture of determinism
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: The factualist analysis requires different counterfactuals to be validated by different mixtures of determinism and indeterminism. But all counterfactuals must be evaluated relative to the same world with the same laws. This requires our world to simultaneously exhibit incompatible mixtures of determinism and indeterminism, which is absurd.

525. [MODAL-027] Indeterminism destroys counterfactual truth conditions
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: If the macroscopic world is non-negligibly indeterministic, the factualist position is nullified. If identical initial conditions lead to an outcome only X% of the time, then the counterfactual 'if I'd turned the key, the car would have started' lacks truth value - at most we can say there's an X% chance it starts.

526. [MODAL-028] Worlds are not sets of propositions
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Worlds are not sets of propositions. Our world is something which makes propositions be true or false. A set of propositions does not make propositions be true or false. The set <snow is white, grass is green, penguins fly> doesn't make any of those propositions true or false - it exists regardless of their truth values.

527. [MODAL-029] Weak factualism is incoherent
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Weak factualists (who identify worlds with sets of propositions) hold an incoherent position. They deny that counterfactuals merely register probabilification relations among propositions, and they deny that counterfactuals register facts about other concrete worlds. But these are the only coherent options.

528. [MODAL-030] Maximal consistent sets useless for counterfactuals
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: Alternative worlds as maximal consistent sets of propositions are absolutely useless for analyzing counterfactuals. Such sets would need to contain propositions covering every possible question, but including all such detail defeats the purpose of counterfactual analysis.

529. [PHIL-004] Philosophy as Pathological Symptom Rather Than Pure Inquiry
   Sources: Lines 26-35
   Thesis: Philosophy, at least in its skeptical and hyper-rationalist forms, is better understood as a pathological symptom analogous to OCD rather than as pure disinterested inquiry into truth.

530. [PHIL-005] Paradigm-Relativism as Psychopathic Magnet
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: Concepts like Kuhn's 'paradigm' from The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, along with topics like time travel, quantum theory, relativism, and post-modernism, serve as magnets for truth-concealing psychopaths who swarm over these topics to dismantle life- and thought-critical epistemic instruments without putting anything in their place.

531. [PHIL-006] Refutation of Intentionalism Through Sellarsian Analysis
   Sources: Chapter Abstract and Conclusion
   Thesis: Unless Sellars is completely wrong about the myth of the given, intentionalism must be completely wrong. Since Sellars' anti-foundationalism is now widely accepted and his arguments are compelling, intentionalism should be rejected. The paper merely makes explicit the connection between intentionalism and foundationalism.

532. [PHIL-007] Translation of Linguistic Work for Philosophical Audiences
   Sources: Chapter Abstract and Introduction
   Thesis: Boguslawski's paper, originally written for linguists, needs translation into the language of philosophy of language for philosophers to understand its relevance to their work. Such translation is not strict - it legitimately involves extending and modifying arguments and contentions for philosophical purposes.

533. [PHIL-008] De-psychologizing Kant's Transcendental Arguments
   Sources: Chapter Part 1, Sections I, IX-X
   Thesis: Despite problems with synthetic a priori, Kant's important claims about causality, personal identity, and rationality are correct and founded on cogent arguments. But to make this apparent, Kant's reasoning must be 'de-psychologized' - statements about psychology reinterpreted as statements about logic. This requires only minor terminological adjustments (replacing 'synthetic a priori' with 'hard analytic').

534. [POL-001] Market Regulation Necessity Thesis
   Sources: Analysis of 1929 Crash, 2001 Dot Bomb, 2008 Housing Crisis
   Thesis: Financial markets require government regulation to prevent systemic instability. Unregulated financial markets reliably produce crashes that harm the broader economy.

535. [POL-002] Systemic Risk Justifies Constraint
   Sources: Analysis of bank behaviors leading to 2008 crisis
   Thesis: When private economic activities create systemic risks that endanger the broader economy, government intervention is justified to constrain those activities, even when individual actors are behaving rationally.

536. [POL-003] Separation of Function Principle
   Sources: Analysis of Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banking
   Thesis: Institutions serving essential public functions (like holding customer deposits) should be legally separated from speculative activities to prevent public harm from private risk-taking.

537. [POL-004] Transparency as Regulatory Foundation
   Sources: Discussion of SEC, CFPB, and transparency requirements
   Thesis: Market participants must operate with complete transparency to prevent fraud and enable informed decision-making. Opacity in financial markets enables exploitation and systemic instability.

538. [POL-005] Too-Big-To-Fail Paradox
   Sources: Analysis of 2008 bailouts and EESA
   Thesis: When financial institutions become so large that their failure would catastrophically damage the economy, they must be either regulated more stringently or broken up. Their size creates moral hazard: they can take excessive risks knowing government must rescue them.

539. [POL-006] The State is Necessary for Contract Enforcement and Economies of Scale
   Sources: Critique of Goldman, paragraph after Goldman's position
   Thesis: Contrary to anarchist positions like Goldman's, the state is necessary for enforcing contracts and enabling economies of scale, which are in turn necessary for the improvements to life that people actually want and value.

540. [POL-007] Anarchism Fails on Pragmatic Grounds
   Sources: Critique of Goldman, final paragraph on Goldman
   Thesis: While Goldman may be right that the state causes some crime and often behaves unjustly, anarchism fails because without state enforcement of contracts and provision of public goods, people cannot achieve the standard of living and freedom they desire. The benefits of the state outweigh its costs.

541. [POL-008] Primitivism/Tribalism Fails on Pragmatic Grounds
   Sources: Critique of Rousseau, paragraph beginning 'There is a serious problem'
   Thesis: Rousseau's vision of pre-civilizational tribal life as ideal fails because tribal life involves serious disadvantages: lack of choices in profession and lifestyle, lack of medical care and education, geographical confinement, lack of technology, and need to work for every meal. These disadvantages outweigh any advantages of simpler social organization.

542. [POL-009] Tribal Life Was Not Idyllic
   Sources: Critique of Rousseau, middle of critique paragraph
   Thesis: Contrary to Rousseau's romanticization, tribal life was likely not placid and carefree. Tribes attacked one another and were capable of behaving cruelly toward their own members. The evidence does not support the claim that pre-civilizational life was psychologically or morally superior.

543. [POL-010] Revealed Preference Argument Against Primitivism
   Sources: Critique of Rousseau, final sentence of critique
   Thesis: If tribal life were truly idyllic as Rousseau claims, people today would opt for it, but they don't. This revealed preference is evidence against the claim that pre-civilizational life is superior.

544. [POL-011] Classical Liberalism is Probably Approximately Correct
   Sources: Defense of Hayek, paragraph beginning 'Is Hayek right'
   Thesis: Hayek's liberalism - the position that good government is minimal government that protects people, gives them freedom, but otherwise doesn't interfere - is likely at least approximately correct. Over-regulated economies fail (Soviet Union) and minimally regulated ones flourish (early US), and people should be allowed to live as they want within reason.

545. [POL-012] Competition is Superior to Central Planning
   Sources: Quote and endorsement of Hayek, middle section
   Thesis: Following Hayek, competition is superior to central planning not only because it's more efficient, but because it's the only method that doesn't require coercive or arbitrary intervention by authority. Competition allows individuals to decide for themselves whether the prospects of an occupation compensate for its disadvantages.

546. [POL-013] 'Intentions of the Framers' Denotes Idealization Not Empirical Reality
   Sources: Lines 1-35 (first page)
   Thesis: When we speak of 'the intentions of the framers', we are committed to an idealization rather than empirical actuality. The various framers (Adams, Jefferson, Washington) had numerically and qualitatively different minds, so talk of their collective intentions is institutional rather than psychological.

547. [POL-014] Originalism Involves Vicious Circularity
   Sources: Lines 36-50
   Thesis: Originalism collapses into circularity (or triviality): Constitutional interpretations are to be evaluated in terms of framers' intentions, but the framers' intentions are to be understood in terms of the historical and social role of Constitutional interpretation.

548. [POL-015] Framers' Intentions as Theoretical Constructs Presupposing Conceptions of Constitutionality
   Sources: Lines 51-65
   Thesis: The expression 'intentions of the framers' denotes an idealization—a theoretical construct with no precise spatiotemporal counterpart. The theories embodied in uses of this expression concern the role the Constitution should have, so originalism is viciously circular or trivial.

549. [POL-016] Counterfactuals About Framers Presuppose Rather Than Ground Constitutional Interpretations
   Sources: Lines 150-200
   Thesis: When legal theorists run counterfactuals about what Jefferson would have said about contemporary issues (like gay marriage), they are not making empirical statements but a priori propositions about what he should have said given his values. This presupposes rather than grounds conceptions of Constitutionality.

550. [POL-017] Idealized Jefferson Incorporates Normative Commitments About Constitutionality
   Sources: Lines 200-250
   Thesis: When we talk about 'what Jefferson would have said', we're talking about what some idealization of Jefferson would have said—a Jefferson purged of cultural limitations and temporal parochialism. This idealization incorporates a certain conception of Constitutionality.

551. [POL-018] 'Jefferson's Values' Denotes Idealization Creating Parallel Circularity
   Sources: Lines 300-350
   Thesis: The expression 'Jefferson's values' itself denotes an idealization rather than psychological reality, involving a circularity parallel to that in 'framers' intentions'. We use conceptions of Constitutionality to identify which values are 'his', then use those values to determine Constitutionality.

552. [POL-019] Historical Counterfactuals Replace Empirical Propositions with A Priori Propositions About Values
   Sources: Lines 400-450
   Thesis: Once we start dealing with idealizations of framers' psyches rather than their actual psyches, we have replaced empirical propositions about their psychology with a priori propositions about values. Such counterfactuals presuppose conceptions of Constitutionality and thus cannot substantiate them.

553. [POL-020] Originalism Condemns Itself to Vicious Circularity or Innocuous Tautology
   Sources: Lines 50, 65, 450
   Thesis: The originalist position, when properly understood, collapses into either vicious circularity (using Constitutional conceptions to identify framers' intentions/values, then using those to determine Constitutional meaning) or innocuous tautology (the Constitution means what we think it should mean).

554. [POL-021] Originalist Must Identify Values Before Running Counterfactuals, Creating Circle
   Sources: Lines 270-280
   Thesis: The originalist is caught in a vicious circle: he must use counterfactuals to identify the values on which his conception of Constitutionality is based, but cannot run those counterfactuals until he has identified those values.

555. [POL-022] Free Markets Inherently Generate Irresolvable Wealth Inequalities
   Sources: Chapter Outline of Economics Paper on Contradictions in Free Market
   Thesis: It is inherent in the free market that it leads to inequalities of wealth and income that cannot be resolved within a free market framework. The free market cannot be expected to diminish the wealth disparities that it itself creates.

556. [POL-023] Government Has Responsibility to Correct Market-Generated Inequalities
   Sources: Chapter Outline of Economics Paper on Contradictions in Free Market
   Thesis: Since the free market cannot diminish the wealth disparities it creates, the government is responsible for diminishing these disparities. Capitalist countries like Sweden enjoy capitalism's benefits while avoiding unjust wealth disparities through progressive taxation.

557. [POL-024] War on Drugs Vindicated Libertarian Conception of State's Rightful Role
   Sources: Chapter Some Reflections on the Virtues of the Free Market
   Thesis: Marijuana legalization constitutes a major victory for the libertarian conception of the state's rightful role. The state should confine itself to preventing clear crimes (assault, rape, theft, fraud) and should refrain from criminalizing acts for purely moral rather than pragmatic reasons.

558. [POL-025] Classical Liberals Vindicated on Drug Policy, Contemporary Liberals Proven Wrong
   Sources: Chapter Some Reflections on the Virtues of the Free Market
   Thesis: Right-wing economists (free-marketeers like Milton Friedman) were completely vindicated on drug policy: anti-drug laws paralyzed markets, encouraged cartels, depleted economy. Left-wing economists favoring government-created jobs were proven completely wrong.

559. [POL-026] Free Market as Driving Force of Healthy Economy and Culture
   Sources: Chapter De Tocqueville on Egoism
   Thesis: For classical liberals (Smith, Locke, Hume), ego/individualism is the driving force of a healthy economy, and a healthy economy is the backbone of a healthy culture. Freedom, including economic freedom, is the most natural condition possible.

560. [POL-027] Rousseau/Marx View Free Market as Basis of Unnatural Unjust Social Order
   Sources: Chapter De Tocqueville on Egoism
   Thesis: Opponents of free markets (Rousseau, Marx) regard it as basis of unnatural social order creating horrible inequalities and intolerable deprivations. What classical liberals see as healthy individualism, they see as psychopathic egoism and greed requiring return to pre-capitalist moral purity.

561. [POL-028] Plato's Justice Requires Rigid Hierarchical Social Strata Based on Fixed Nature
   Sources: Chapter Plato's Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy
   Thesis: For Plato, justice is identical with people staying in their 'rightful place.' Social position should be determined by one's nature, which cannot relevantly change. Social strata must be rigidly defined with virtually impenetrable barriers between classes.

562. [POL-029] Plato's Republic Requires Complete Subordination of Private Life to State
   Sources: Chapter Plato's Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy
   Thesis: Plato doesn't acknowledge legitimacy of private life. Entirety of person's life must be subordinate to state interests. Marriages arranged for state benefit, reproduction controlled, no private property, complete collectivization of existence.

563. [POL-030] Plato's Justice Completely Depends on State Propaganda and Systematic Lies
   Sources: Chapter Plato's Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy
   Thesis: For Plato, justice depends completely on the state constantly lying to its citizenry, keeping them ignorant, and filling knowledge gaps with carefully constructed propaganda. This is necessary to maintain rigid hierarchical social order.

564. [POL-031] Plato's Distinction Between Benign and Dangerous Lies Cannot Be Sustained
   Sources: Chapter Plato's Republic as Pol Potist Bureaucracy
   Thesis: Plato's distinction between benign/beneficial lies and improper/dangerous lies cannot be sustained. Since Plato's conception of justice denies people any freedoms, and such conception is false and evil, any lies told to uphold it are ipso facto evil.

565. [POL-032] Market Economy is Enlightenment Economy Linking Status to Ability Not Birth
   Sources: Chapter Knowledge-capital
   Thesis: Since the Enlightenment, one's stature in society has come to depend increasingly on one's own abilities (including intellectual abilities) and decreasingly on social position one was born into. Market economy is Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment economy where ability to acquire/retain property depends largely on intellectual abilities.

566. [POL-033] Kant's Enlightenment Autonomy Has Operational Meaning Only in Market Economy
   Sources: Chapter Knowledge-capital
   Thesis: Kant's exhortation to 'have the courage to use your own understanding' has operational meaning only in market economy. In non-market economy it's meaningless - indentured servant who thinks for himself gains nothing practical. But in market economy one has nothing to rely on but own judgment.

567. [POL-034] Legal Freedom Compatible with Complete Substantive Enslavement
   Sources: Chapter Legal vs. Substantive Freedom and the Paradox of the Free Market
   Thesis: The freedoms people have in market economy (to own and exchange goods and services) inevitably lead to complete mutual enslavement under pretexts of 'universal legal protection of rights' and 'economic freedom.' Legal freedom coexists with substantive slavery.

568. [POL-035] Free Market Turns People Into Commodities and Mere Spectacles
   Sources: Chapter Legal vs. Substantive Freedom and the Paradox of the Free Market
   Thesis: Market-based society, as opposed to culture-based society, inevitably turns people into objects or 'mere spectacles' (Debord's term). Pornography is paradigm case: human being literally turned into commodity that exists only to be consumed by being looked at.

569. [POL-036] 2008 crisis was dual: housing bubble plus banking collapse
   Sources: WORK-029 (lines 180-210)
   Thesis: The 2008 financial crisis had two distinct components with different mechanisms: (1) a housing bubble driven by subprime lending and securitization, and (2) a banking system collapse caused by interconnected megabanks' exposure to toxic assets. These require different regulatory responses: the first needs better lending standards, the second needs to break up megabanks.

570. [POL-37] Socrates executed for wartime disruption, not truth-seeking
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part I)
   Thesis: Socrates was executed for being disruptive during Athens' civil war, not for seeking truth. He caused Athenians to question moral beliefs that undergirded patriotism precisely when Athens most needed political unity.

571. [POL-38] Philosophical questioning can undermine necessary political unity
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part I)
   Thesis: While truth is generally preferable to fiction, philosophical questioning of foundational beliefs can weaken necessary social cohesion, especially during crises requiring unified action.

572. [POL-39] Socrates sought power through intellectual influence
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part II)
   Thesis: Socrates' philosophical activity was a strategy to gain power not through official positions but by installing his worldview at the top through grooming power-adjacent elites. He wanted to be the state, not serve it.

573. [POL-40] Philosopher-king doctrine as mission statement, not abstract ideal
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part II)
   Thesis: The philosopher-king doctrine was not an abstract ideal but Socrates' mission statement - a concrete plan for installing someone like himself in power. That's why he was executed: his answers, if acted on, would have made him king.

574. [POL-41] Socrates delegitimized authority with replacement theory
   Sources: WORK-038 (Why Was Socrates Executed? Part III)
   Thesis: Socrates wasn't just exposing ignorance for sport - he was methodically delegitimizing existing authority while building a replacement system where 'someone who knows' (the philosopher) should rule instead of generals, priests, or wealthy.

575. [POL-42] The Republic as conservative propaganda disguised as political philosophy
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Plato's Republic is fundamentally conservative propaganda designed to rationalize aristocratic power and prevent revolution, not genuine political philosophy seeking justice.

576. [POL-43] Plato's Good/Real equivalence as coded social stability doctrine
   Sources: WORK-038 (The Republic as Political Tract)
   Thesis: Plato's linking of 'the Good' with 'the real' makes no literal sense (since bad things are real) but makes perfect sense as code: 'good/real' = what conduces to social stability, 'bad/shadows' = what threatens social stability.

577. [POL-44] Plato's political philosophy replaces world with thought-world
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: Plato's system was completely a priori - he wasn't engaging actual world but proposing to replace it with his own thought-world having little reality or justification outside his thought-space.

578. [POL-45] Philosopher-king doctrine is incoherent
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: The idea that society should be ruled by philosopher-king is incoherent because societies must be run by sapient doers, not sapient thinkers - by people who engage world through action, not by those who flee into intellectual constructions.

579. [POL-46] Marx's political philosophy as destructive a priori fantasy
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: Marx explicitly proposed destroying existing social structure and replacing it with system having no real basis in reality (totally fabricated), which when implemented led to unprecedented loss of life and opportunity.

580. [PRAG-001] Cancelability Test
   Sources: WORK-004
   Thesis: Conversational implicatures always cancelable. Existence presuppositions not cancelable. Therefore not conversational implicature.

581. [PRAG-002] Conventional Implicature Constraint
   Sources: WORK-004
   Thesis: Conventional implicature doesn't obscure truth-conditions. Adds 'tone' but never makes synonyms differ in truth-conditions.

582. [PRAG-003] Function of 'Exactly,' 'Precisely,' 'Literally' Modifiers
   Sources: Chapter Section on literal meaning
   Thesis: Expressions like 'exactly,' 'precisely,' and 'literally' have the semantic function of confining the auditor's attention to literal meaning - telling the auditor not to draw inferences beyond what is literally affirmed. These modifiers reveal what expressions mean literally by blocking pragmatic enrichment.

583. [PSY-004] Group Psychology is Explanatorily Prior to Individual Psychology
   Sources: Main argument throughout essay
   Thesis: Contrary to standard psychological methodology, group psychology should be understood as explanatorily fundamental, with individual psychology being derivative. Individual drives and behaviors are best explained as necessary for the survival and functioning of collectives, rather than collectives being aggregations of individual behaviors.

584. [PSY-005] Conformism Cannot Be Explained by Individual Psychology Alone
   Sources: Paragraph 3
   Thesis: The extreme degree of conformism exhibited by people - their deference to convention, custom, and fleeting fads even at the expense of personal gratification - cannot be adequately explained by individual psychology even after accounting for intellectual shortcomings and fear of others.

585. [PSY-006] Collective Intelligence Exceeds Individual Intelligence
   Sources: Paragraph 4
   Thesis: Given how unintelligent, ignorant, and lacking in moral fiber most individuals are, yet how much intelligence, knowledge, and moral rigor is embodied in collective behaviors (corporations, academic disciplines), it is implausible that collectives are mere aggregations of individuals pursuing their own paths. The collective appears to be the primary thing biologically.

586. [PSY-007] Philosophers and Obsessive-Compulsives Share Compulsive Doubt
   Sources: Lines 26-27
   Thesis: Philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are both compulsive doubters who doubt the obvious, rationalizing this as rigor while actually expressing impotence and fear of engaging the world.

587. [PSY-008] Philosophers and OCD Sufferers Manipulate Symbolic Proxies Instead of Reality
   Sources: Lines 26-27
   Thesis: Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives deal with linguistic and symbolic proxies of reality rather than engaging the world directly, seeking dominance in the sphere of thought where they have power.

588. [PSY-009] Preoccupation with Logical Niceties Derives from Impotence
   Sources: Lines 28-29
   Thesis: Both philosophers and obsessive-compulsives are unduly preoccupied with logical niceties and fine points of argumentation as a derivative of their sense of impotence and lack of material to work on.

589. [PSY-010] Mental Illness is Contextual; Physical Illness is Not
   Sources: Lines 374-375
   Thesis: Mental illnesses are contextual in nature—being an asset in some contexts and a liability in others—while physical illnesses like asthma, lupus, or cancer are simply liabilities in all contexts.

590. [PSY-011] Mental Illness Serves Defensive Function
   Sources: Lines 375-376
   Thesis: Mental illnesses serve a defensive/protective function, insulating the subject in a psychological 'safe-space' from toxic and threatening environments, even though they are dysfunctional in some respects.

591. [PSY-012] Mental Illness Involves Misdeployed Strengths
   Sources: Lines 376
   Thesis: Some mental illnesses involve misdeployed strengths of intellect and character—OCD involves misdeployed intelligence and focus; schizophrenia involves misdeployed creativity and emotional sensitivity.

592. [PSY-013] Psychiatric Munchausen's by Proxy as Covert Child Abuse
   Sources: Lines 380
   Thesis: Parents (usually mothers) get psychiatrists to falsely diagnose their children with autism, Asperger's, ADHD to gain attention, resulting in covert child murder through damaging over-attention from educational and psychiatric bureaucrats.

593. [PSY-014] OCD is Ultimately Voluntary
   Sources: Lines 386-391
   Thesis: OCD is ultimately a voluntary condition and an affliction of the will. If one chooses to leave the defensive bubble and re-engage the world, OCD becomes irrelevant or assumes benign/productive forms.

594. [PSY-015] OCD Prognosis Depends on Volitional Choice
   Sources: Lines 390-391
   Thesis: The prognosis for OCD is 100% positive if seen as ultimately voluntary, but negative if seen as garden-variety pathology outside the scope of will. OCD is eliminated or made adaptive by exercising will in growth-oriented ways.

595. [PSY-016] Auto-hypnosis is Essential for Action
   Sources: Lines 395
   Thesis: Auto-hypnosis (giving oneself commands whose efficacy doesn't depend on conscious judgment) is essential for action. Without it, one would be the ultimate bureaucrat who never does anything requiring sustained enthusiasm.

596. [PSY-017] Psychopathy as Complete Lack of Integrity
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: Psychopathy is fundamentally defined as a complete lack of integrity, rather than by specific behavioral symptoms or clinical criteria.

   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: Early-onset psychopaths never develop the character-architecture of normal persons; any appearance of such architecture is pure fabrication. These individuals become con-artists, grifters, drifters, and cult-leaders.

598. [PSY-019] Bureaucratic Psychopathy: Late-Onset Institutional Submission
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: A vastly more common form of psychopathy is 'bureaucratic psychopathy' (bureaupath), in which individuals forfeit their integrity late in life to fit into bureaucratic institutions or pseudo-legitimate professional areas like academia or law. These individuals retain the formal properties of normal character but have become hollow husks in whom 'the magic is gone and the spark is gone.'

599. [PSY-020] Academic Humanities Psychopathy: Truth-Concealing Through Pseudo-Cognitive Categories
   Sources: Chapter Main text
   Thesis: A third type of late-onset psychopathy, prevalent in humanities academia, involves projecting one's failure to understand onto the object of non-understanding by 'sliming it up' with spongiform pseudo-cognitive categories like 'narrative,' 'critique,' and 'literature' rather than admitting non-comprehension.

   Sources: Chapter Introduction
   Thesis: A person's emotional attachments influence the way in which he deals with problematic situations, and the way in which he deals with problematic situations influences his relations to others. Attachment Theory is a cluster of theories based on this fundamental tenet.

601. [PSY-022] Freud's Account of Character Architecture
   Sources: Chapter Historical background
   Thesis: According to Freud, a psychologically healthy adult is someone whose parents loved him but did not spoil him. The mother's job is to provide love (leading to self-love), and the father's job is to provide discipline (leading to self-discipline). Adult success depends on having a healthy combination of self-love and self-discipline.

602. [PSY-023] Bowlby's Attachment Behavioral System
   Sources: Chapter Bowlby's contribution
   Thesis: An 'attachment behavioral system' (ABS) refers to the behaviors and attitudes that determine how a person forms relationships and deals with abandonment. A person's ABS is largely determined by the nature of early-life relationships with caregivers. To become a healthy adult, a child needs at least one stable attachment with a caregiver.

603. [PSY-024] Four Basic Infant Attachment Patterns
   Sources: Chapter Infant attachment patterns
   Thesis: There are four basic attachment patterns in infants: (1) Secure - happy, confident, boldly exploratory with nurturing caregivers; (2) Anxious-ambivalent - cautious, worried about caregiver departure, with withdrawn/unreliable caregivers; (3) Anxious-avoidant - not distressed by departure, avoid caregiver on return, focus on physical environment, have abusive caregivers; (4) Disorganized - respond with fear to returning caregivers, have extremely abusive or highly unreliable caregivers.

604. [PSY-025] Persistence of Attachment Patterns Through Development
   Sources: Chapter Developmental persistence
   Thesis: The four attachment patterns (secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, disorganized) persist from infancy through childhood into adulthood, though with developmentally appropriate manifestations. There is good evidence that a child's attachment pattern tends to be identical with the one he had as an infant, though categorical identity remains an open question. Some evidence suggests adults can have different attachment patterns from earlier life.

605. [PSY-026] Attachment Insecurities Linked to Specific Psychopathologies
   Sources: Chapter Attachment and psychopathology
   Thesis: Attachment insecurities of both anxious and avoidant varieties are associated with depression, anxiety disorders, OCD, PTSD, suicidal tendencies, and eating disorders. Anxious attachment specifically associates with dependent, histrionic, and borderline disorders, while avoidant attachment associates with schizoid and avoidant disorders.

606. [PSY-027] Kuczynski's Explanation of Attachment-Psychopathology Connections
   Sources: Chapter Kuczynski's theoretical contribution
   Thesis: According to Kuczynski (2012), schizoid and psychotic disorders involve scrambling of the subject's grasp of reality itself because early-life attachments were negative (not merely ambiguous), disposing them to flee from reality in the most radical way possible. By contrast, histrionic, borderline, and dependent disorders involve fundamentally non-delusive grasp of reality but inappropriate emotions because early-life attachments were ambivalent, disposing them to keep distance from external reality without altogether abandoning it.

   Sources: WORK-008 (Stockdale Paradox)
   Thesis: Optimism is a form of denial; one believes 'everything will be ok' when one has reason to believe otherwise but lacks self-confidence to confront that fact

703. [PSY-124] Optimism is motivated by insecurity-driven lack of realism and leads to failure; self-belief is motivated by confidence-driven realism and leads to success
   Sources: WORK-008 (Stockdale Paradox)
   Thesis: Optimism is motivated by insecurity-driven lack of realism and leads to failure; self-belief is motivated by confidence-driven realism and leads to success

   Sources: WORK-008 (Ironic Process Theory)
   Thesis: Attempting not to have thoughts of a certain kind tends to make such thoughts more likely to occur (Ironic Process Theory)

705. [PSY-126] Polytheistic impulses may be psychologically basic
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 615-640)
   Thesis: The historical prevalence of polytheism and its apparent 'revival' in Christianity's Trinitarian development suggest polytheistic religious instincts may be more psychologically basic than monotheism. Humans may naturally tend toward recognizing multiple divine beings, with monotheism being the culturally constructed exception.

706. [PSY-127] Religious conceptions reflect relational needs
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 670-700)
   Thesis: Human conceptions of divinity are shaped by psychological needs for relationship, protection, and meaning. Smith's theology reflects this: God is conceived as having the attributes (limited power/knowledge, personal concern, accessibility) that enable the required guardian-child relationship, rather than attributes following from abstract philosophical reasoning.

707. [PSY-128] Brain Centers for Militant Atheism and Fundamentalism Are Identical
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 43)
   Thesis: The brain structures that mediate militant atheism are the same as those mediating religious fundamentalism.

708. [PSY-129] Denying Spiritualism Causes Psychological Morbidity
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 29, 194-198)
   Thesis: According to James, Otto, and Eliade, genuinely lacking belief in transcendence (not merely lacking explicit religion) leads to various forms of psychological disorder.

709. [PSY-130] Historical Variation in Fundamental Psychology
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 36-37, 164-174)
   Thesis: Basic psychological structures (like perception and meaning-making) vary fundamentally across historical and cultural contexts, challenging universalist psychology.

710. [PSY-131] Consciousness maximizes energy efficiency
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: Mental/psychological dimensions make organisms more energy-efficient than they would otherwise be. Psychological growth is a particularly extreme way of increasing an organism's level of energy-efficiency.

711. [PSY-131] Philosophy as intellectualized impotence / retreat from reality
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: Both OCD and philosophy involve retreating from exigencies of external actual reality into the safety of internal pseudo-reality. Both are forms of intellectualized impotence.

712. [PSY-132] Obsessive beliefs are pseudo-beliefs
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: Obsessive beliefs are pseudo-beliefs - if someone obsessionally believes that such and such, what they actually believe is the opposite. Obsessive hatred represents lingering attachment that won't be admitted. Obsessing that someone is listening to phone calls expresses fear that no one cares.

713. [PSY-132] OCD and philosophy are homologous psychopathologies
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: OCD and philosophy are not merely analogous but homologous - from a psychopathological perspective they represent the same underlying condition: autistic withdrawal from reality into thought-space.

714. [PSY-133] Compulsive actions are pseudo-actions
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: Compulsive acts are pseudo-actions - if one compulsively does such and such, one's real intention is to do the opposite. Compulsive avoidance of an ex-girlfriend indicates wanting to see her. Compulsive doting on mother actually expresses hatred for her.

715. [PSY-133] Republic exhibits OCD-like rigidity and protocols
   Sources: WORK-038 (Philosophy as Psychopathology)
   Thesis: The absurdity of Plato's Republic manifests in its OCD-like features: rigid society, stereotyped protocols for education and social interaction, death penalty for minor violations (in Laws).

716. [PSY-134] OCD essence is ambivalence
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: The essence of OCD is ambivalence - simultaneously loving and hating the same object. The compulsively doting son both loves and hates his mother. Because he loves her, his desire not to be with her must express itself circuitously through compulsive behaviors.

717. [PSY-135] Doing and undoing in OCD
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: The obsessional engages in 'doing and undoing' (Freud) - does something, then undoes it, then undoes the undoing. Driving to mother's house, then turning back for wallet, then back again for stove. This represents the stalemate between love and hatred, with each emotion expressing itself through the oscillating behavior.

718. [PSY-136] OCD behavior as overdetermined
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: OCD behaviors are overdetermined (Freud) - they serve multiple unconscious functions simultaneously. Back-and-forth driving serves both to express ambivalence toward mother and to discharge sexual frustration through piston-like repetitive motion mimicking the sexual act.

719. [PSY-137] Symbolic representation in OCD symptoms
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: OCD symptoms involve symbolic representation of unconscious desires and conflicts. Fear about stove being left on represents undischarged libido; the stove symbolizes passionate desire. Driving behavior symbolizes sexual act. 'Fear' the stove will explode is really desire that genital region will 'explode.'

720. [PSY-138] Awareness without consciousness in the obsessional
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: The obsessional is aware of underlying dynamics (mother's treachery, sexual frustration) without being consciously aware. One can be aware of something at the level of unconsciousness. The person doesn't quite see irritating behaviors for what they are even unconsciously, but is surely aware at some level.

721. [PSY-139] Single ultimate determinant despite overdetermination
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: Despite overdetermination, behavior may have a single ultimate determinant. The son's behavior is overdetermined by both ambivalence toward mother and sexual frustration, but ultimately the sexual frustration is primary - ambivalence exists because mother causes sexual frustration. The two causes operate as a single cause in this context.

722. [PSY-140] Consciousness of hatred eliminates compulsions
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: When unconscious hatred becomes conscious, associated compulsions vanish. The compulsiveness exists precisely because the true feelings are unconscious. Once awareness reaches consciousness, the need for disguised expression through compulsion disappears.

723. [PSY-141] Compulsive time management as defense
   Sources: WORK-036
   Thesis: Compulsive punctuality (showing up two hours early) serves as a hedge against the unconscious wish not to show up at all. Being 'hyper on time' insulates against the desire to avoid the obligation entirely. This is another form of doing and undoing.

724. [PSYCH-001] Problem Portability
   Sources: Dialogue on transferring schools/cities
   Thesis: Wherever you go, there you are. Your problems tend to follow you. External change without internal change doesn't solve problems.

725. [PSYCH-002] Universal Beauty Under Blindness
   Sources: Dialogue on ugliness in the world
   Thesis: Everything is beautiful, but most people are blind to most of the beauty. The ugliness perceived in the world reflects perceptual limitations rather than absence of beauty.

726. [PSYCH-003] Ability-Demand Asymmetry
   Sources: Dialogue on abilities being economically useful
   Thesis: Ability will never catch up with the demand for it. There is always more need for ability than supply of it.

727. [REL-001] God progressed to divinity from humanity
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 56-169)
   Thesis: Joseph Smith's King Follett Discourse argued that God was once a man who became divine through spiritual development. This represents a radical break from traditional Christian theology, implying divinity is not an absolute status but an achieved state, and the distinction between God and humanity is one of degree rather than kind.

728. [REL-002] God created through organization, not ex nihilo
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 246-258)
   Thesis: God did not create the world ex nihilo but by organizing pre-existing chaotic matter. The Hebrew 'baurau' means to organize, not to create from nothing. Pure elements are eternal and indestructible—they can be organized and reorganized but never created or destroyed.

729. [REL-003] Human spirits are immortal and have always existed
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 274-300)
   Thesis: The intelligence of human spirits has no beginning and no end. If something is immortal (has no end), logic dictates it also had no beginning. Therefore, human beings have always existed eternally. This eternal pre-existence follows from the same principle that makes God self-existent.

730. [REL-004] Multiple gods exist in hierarchical arrangement
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 205-232)
   Thesis: Although there is a supreme God, multiple lesser gods also exist. This follows from the doctrine of eternal progression: if humans can become gods through spiritual development, and this process has been ongoing eternally, then many gods must exist. The Hebrew 'Elohim' (Gods, plural) indicates this plurality.

731. [REL-005] King Follett vision transcends its arguments
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 98-108)
   Thesis: Smith's arguments for his theological positions in KFD, even if assumed cogent, would not lead anyone to accept his radical vision. The merits of the vision lie in the vision itself, not in the arguments. This raises the historiographical question: where did Smith's vision originate?

732. [REL-006] Smith's theology evolved from monotheism to polytheism
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 556-608)
   Thesis: Joseph Smith's theology underwent systematic evolution. Early period (1820-1835): unambiguous monotheism. Middle period (1835): God and Jesus treated as distinct entities. Later Nauvoo period (1839-1844): full polytheism—God has a father, belongs to a council of gods, humans can become gods. Hebrew study accelerated the shift.

733. [REL-007] Orthodox Christianity is crypto-polytheistic
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 528-539)
   Thesis: Orthodox Christianity is not strictly monotheistic despite its claims. If Jesus is truly the son of God (not God himself), and the Holy Ghost is a distinct force, and God is an exalted person-like being, then there are at least three divine beings, making Christianity crypto-polytheistic. The doctrine that God, Jesus, and Holy Ghost are 'three but one' is absurd and logically incoherent.

734. [REL-008] Christianity represents revival of polytheistic instincts
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 616-634)
   Thesis: Historically, polytheism is the rule and monotheism the exception. Christianity may represent a revival of polytheistic instincts. Early Church Doctors needed at least two divinities (God and Jesus) but couldn't openly embrace polytheism. They therefore affirmed absurdly that God and Jesus, though two, are one.

735. [REL-009] Smith's theology prioritizes divine-human relationship
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 658-696)
   Thesis: Smith's fundamental question was: What must God be like if humans are to have the required relationship with Him? This breaks with both philosophical and Christian traditions that focus on logical puzzles about God's attributes. Smith starts with the assumption that God is psychologically able and willing to serve as guardian, attributing only as much power and knowledge as is compatible with this relational requirement.

736. [REL-010] Logical proofs of God turn Him into impersonal force
   Sources: WORK-028 (lines 695-700)
   Thesis: Attempts to prove God's existence inevitably turn Him into an impersonal force or principle, stripping Him of the ability to have relationships with humans. If 'God' is defined as 'maximally perfect being,' 'guarantor of natural law,' or 'unmoved mover,' this abstracts away the personal characteristics necessary for divine-human relationship.

737. [REL-011] Three Attitudes Toward Religion
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 22-28)
   Thesis: There are fundamentally three attitudes toward religion: (1) uncritical acceptance, (2) rejection, and (3) critical/reflective acceptance.

738. [REL-012] Contemporary Fundamentalism is Reactive, Not Uncritical
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 35-37)
   Thesis: Contemporary religious fundamentalists are not genuinely 'uncritically accepting' of religion because they live in pluralistic societies and are reacting against non-religious views.

739. [REL-013] Contemporary Atheism as Herd Mentality
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 40-43)
   Thesis: Most contemporary atheists are simply following social norms rather than reasoning independently, making their mentality similar to medieval religious believers.

740. [REL-014] Reductive vs. Non-Reductive Accounts of Religion
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 44-49)
   Thesis: There are both reductive (explanatory/causal) and non-reductive (phenomenological/essential) truths about religion, and the essence of religion lies in non-reductive truths.

741. [REL-015] Religion Requires Unshakable Conviction in Transcendence
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 29)
   Thesis: The essence of religious sentiment is the unshakable conviction that 'this world is not all that there is' and that psychological health requires this view.

742. [REL-016] Writing as the Basis of Rationalism
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 13, 50-100)
   Thesis: The development of writing is the foundation of rationalism, creating economies of scale and enabling the linearization of time.

743. [REL-017] Economies of Scale Cause Time-Linearization
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 13, 50-100)
   Thesis: Large-scale economic and social organization causes the shift from circular to linear conceptions of time characteristic of rationalism.

744. [REL-018] James, Otto, and Eliade Describe Animism, Not Institutional Religion
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 168-174)
   Thesis: When James, Otto, and Eliade discuss 'religion,' they are actually describing pre-civilizational animistic spiritualism, not institutional religions like Christianity or Islam.

745. [REL-019] Spiritualism vs. Rationalism as Fundamental Orientations
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 176-193)
   Thesis: For the spiritualist, the world is a living subject and partner; for the rationalist, the world is dead matter existing only to be used as an object.

746. [REL-020] Humans Cannot Become Non-Spiritual
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 194-198)
   Thesis: Just as we cannot become asexual (per Freud), we cannot become non-spiritual; we can only mistakenly believe we are non-spiritual and thereby undermine our biological condition.

747. [REL-021] Rationalism as Extension of Spiritualism, Not Rejection
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 198)
   Thesis: Rationalism is a 'rarefied extension' of spiritualism, not a rejection of it; the error is seeing rationalism as anti-spiritual.

748. [REL-022] Contemporary 'Spiritualism' is Actually Nihilism
   Sources: WORK-030 (lines 30-33)
   Thesis: 21st-century self-described 'spiritual but not religious' people manifest nihilism and absence of genuine spiritualism, not its presence.

749. [REL-023] Omniscience precludes action
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: An all-knowing being cannot act because action presupposes ignorance. If one knows with certainty what will happen, one cannot coherently attempt to influence what will happen and therefore cannot intend to act.

750. [REL-024] Omnipotence precludes feeling
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: An all-powerful being cannot experience feelings. Only a being capable of being changed can experience feelings, and if a being is incapable of being changed, it cannot feel.

751. [REL-025] Immutability precludes self-change
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: A being incapable of being changed cannot change itself. To change oneself is to be changed, albeit by oneself. A being that cannot be changed cannot be changed by anything, including itself.

752. [REL-026] Omnipotence entails impotence
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: If a being is all-powerful (omnipotent), it is completely impotent. The concept of an all-powerful being is incoherent because such a being could neither act nor change.

753. [REL-027] Traditional divine attributes are incoherent
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: The concepts of an all-knowing being and an all-powerful being are both incoherent. To the extent we conceptualize God as all-knowing and all-powerful, we are conceptualizing Him incoherently.

754. [REL-028] Consciousness is inherent in existence itself
   Sources: WORK-034
   Thesis: It is inherent in existence that existence be conscious. The universe is disintegrating (lacking consciousness) only to the extent it is ceasing to be what it is. To the extent the universe is growing and becoming what it truly is, it has consciousness. Therefore, there is ipso facto a God - the universe itself, which is pulsating with life and thought rather than being cold and mechanical.

755. [SCI-001] Confirmation Requires Principled Generalizations
   Sources: Solution to Raven Paradox
   Thesis: Only principled (nomic/causal) generalizations, not accidental generalizations, can be confirmed. When 'All ravens are black' is read as a principled generalization, it has nomic content and is not equivalent to 'All non-black things are non-ravens.'

756. [SCI-002] AI Systems Test Philosophical Theories Empirically
   Sources: Throughout work
   Thesis: Philosophical theories about reasoning, knowledge acquisition, scientific discovery can be empirically tested by examining whether successful AI systems operate according to those theories. AI provides concrete examinable implementations allowing theory adjudication.

757. [SCI-003] Logic of Discovery is Possible
   Sources: Essay 4
   Thesis: Contrary to traditional philosophy of science claiming logic of discovery is impossible, examining AI scientific reasoning reveals identifiable principles guiding successful theory generation. Genuine logic of discovery exists.

758. [SCI-004] AI Falsifies Popperian Falsificationism
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 3: How AI Falsifies Popper)
   Thesis: AI's success in scientific discovery falsifies Popper's theory that science proceeds primarily through conjecture and refutation. AI systems generate successful theories through pattern matching and inductive generalization, not primarily through bold conjectures and attempts at falsification.

759. [SCI-005] Inductive Discovery Precedes Deductive Testing
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 3)
   Thesis: Contra Popper, successful scientific discovery requires inductive pattern recognition to generate plausible hypotheses before deductive testing. AI demonstrates that purely conjectural approaches without inductive guidance are ineffective.

760. [SCI-006] Reverse Brain Engineering as Scientific Method
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 4: Reverse Brain Engineering)
   Thesis: By building AI systems that replicate cognitive functions, we can infer the computational architecture necessary for those functions. This 'reverse engineering' of the brain through AI construction represents a new and powerful methodology in philosophy of science and cognitive science.

761. [SCI-007] AI Falsifies Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 18: AI and Explanation)
   Thesis: AI's successful explanatory practices falsify the deductive-nomological (covering law) model of explanation. AI generates successful explanations through pattern recognition, analogy, and causal modeling that don't require deduction from universal laws.

762. [SCI-008] Causal-Mechanistic Explanation Doesn't Require Universal Laws
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 18)
   Thesis: AI demonstrates that causal-mechanistic explanation can be successful without appeal to universal laws. Understanding how something works doesn't require subsuming it under exceptionless generalizations.

763. [SCI-009] Explanatory Understanding Through Pattern Recognition
   Sources: WORK-011 (Essay 18)
   Thesis: AI reveals that explanatory understanding can be achieved through recognition of patterns and structural similarities rather than derivation from laws. This suggests explanation is more about grasping relevant relationships than deductive systematization.

764. [SCI-010] Laws of Nature Not Confined to Actual Objects
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The scope of natural law is not confined to actual or even possible objects. Many laws hold with respect to classes all of whose members are merely possible or even prohibited by other natural laws.

765. [SCI-011] Knowledge of Imperceptibles Identical with Conditional Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Knowledge of the imperceptible is identical with knowledge of conditional truth. Knowledge of future, past, possible, and imperceptible present states is always conditional knowledge based on laws.

766. [SCI-012] Three Kinds of Imperceptibles
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Physical objects can be imperceptible in three ways: (1) imperceptible due to severed causal processes (objects in other rooms); (2) imperceptible due to size but perceptible with technology (cells, molecules); (3) imperceptible by natural law regardless of technology (photons, subatomic particles).

767. [SCI-013] The Epistemic Function of Natural Law
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Scientists aspire to identify natural laws so they can, when given context-specific information, make true statements about future, past, or possible behavior of contexts. Laws enable conditional prediction and explanation.

768. [SCI-014] Science Prioritizes Principles Over Particular Facts
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Any interest science has in a given particular fact is subordinate to its interest in the general principles in terms of which that fact is to be understood. Scientists study particular instances only insofar as they instantiate general laws.

769. [SCI-015] Laws May Be Place and Time-Sensitive
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Some natural laws are place- and time-sensitive rather than spatiotemporally invariant. Laws need not hold uniformly across all regions of space-time to be genuine laws.

770. [SCI-016] Hume's Regularity Analysis of Causation Is False
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Hume's Regularity Analysis - the view that causation is nothing but constant conjunction, that 'X causes Y' means 'events of type X are regularly followed by events of type Y' - is demonstrably false.

771. [SCI-017] Hume-Worlds Observationally Different from Non-Humean Worlds
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: A Hume-world (where causation equals regularity with no underlying powers) would be observationally different from our world. The concept of a Hume-world cannot support Hume's analysis.

772. [SCI-018] The Deductive-Nomological Model of Explanation Is False
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model - which holds that to explain event E is to derive E from natural laws plus antecedent conditions - is fundamentally mistaken. Explanation requires causal knowledge, not merely law-subsumption.

773. [SCI-019] DN Viciously Circular via Counterfactual Support
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The DN model is viciously circular if it requires laws to support counterfactuals (as Hempel proposes). Counterfactuals are cryptocausal statements; knowing them requires knowing causes; but knowing causes already provides explanations.

774. [SCI-020] Causal Knowledge as Differential Knowledge
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Causal knowledge is differential knowledge - knowledge of what varies with what. To know causes is to know which changes depend on which other changes and in what proportions.

775. [SCI-021] Causation as Proportionality Restoration
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Causation is fundamentally proportionality restoration. Effects are proportional to their causes (threshold effects aside). When a force acts on an object, the resulting change is proportional to the force magnitude.

776. [SCI-022] Physical Laws as Regularities of Proportion
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Physical laws are regularities of proportion rather than simple universal generalizations. Laws describe how magnitudes vary proportionally with each other rather than stating that all Fs are Gs.

777. [SCI-023] Knowledge-Why Equals High-Resolution Knowledge-What
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: To have knowledge-why is to have high-resolution knowledge-what. Explanatory knowledge differs from mere descriptive knowledge in degree of detail and specificity, not in kind.

778. [SCI-024] The Raven Paradox a By-Product of Regularity Analysis
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: The Raven Paradox (that non-black non-ravens confirm 'all ravens are black') is an artifact of the Regularity Analysis of causation. Once causation is properly understood, the paradox dissolves.

779. [SCI-025] Determinism Doesn't Entail Complete Predictability
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Determinism (every event has a cause) does not entail complete predictability. Two reasons: (1) interference effects make prediction impossible without infinite precision, and (2) knowledge growth itself cannot be predicted.

780. [SCI-026] Implementation-Indeterminism Distinguished from Program-Determinism
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Program-determinism (software-level determinism) is compatible with implementation-indeterminism (hardware-level indeterminism). The same program can be implemented by different physical processes.

781. [SCI-027] Truths Not Objects Are Objects of Explanation
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Truths, not objects or states of affairs themselves, are the proper objects of explanation. We explain why propositions are true, not why objects exist (except derivatively).

782. [SCI-030] Relativity Theory Reveals Causal Structure of Spacetime
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Section V
   Thesis: Recognition that temporal order is causal was forced on us by empirical discoveries, particularly Relativity Theory. If events E and E* are such that no causal signal can pass between them, they have no determinate temporal order. But this recognition that temporal order is causal is itself less like an empirical statement ('all rhenates are chordates') than like a hard analytic truth ('triangles are regions bounded by three coplanar lines').

783. [SCI-031] Complete Description Entails Neighborhood Events
   Sources: Chapter Part 2, Section VIII
   Thesis: For an arbitrary event E, if D is a complete description of E, then D entails the occurrence of events that, by ordinary standards, are distinct from E. A correct and complete description of an empirical state of affairs permits deduction of events in its neighborhood because spatiotemporal continuity is causal.

784. [SCI-032] Psychological Versus Physical Explanation Unified
   Sources: Chapter Part 3, Section VII
   Thesis: Explanation always consists in showing logical and principled relation between initial and terminal conditions. There is no need to reduce psychology to statistics (Hempel, Mill) or to create artificial division between human and natural sciences (Dilthey). Psychological and physical explanation are fundamentally the same kind - both show why it makes sense that events occurred.

785. [SCI-033] Explanation as Principled Relationship, Not Mere Regularity
   Sources: Chapter Part 3, Sections VII, VIII
   Thesis: Explanation exposes principled relationships, not mere regularities. Regularities express rather than constitute principled relationships. The existence of a regularity (e.g., flipping switch causes light to turn on) is consequence, not substance, of principled relationship among properties. If this is wrong, regularity becomes coincidence of unspeakable proportions.

786. [SCI-034] Logically equivalent statements are not necessarily confirmationally equivalent

789. [SCI-037] Philosophical resistance to neuroscience parallels historical science resistance
   Sources: WORK-027 (lines 1800-1850)
   Thesis: Philosophers' resistance to neuroscientific findings about consciousness and free will parallels historical examples of disciplines resisting scientific findings that threatened their authority (e.g., Catholic Church vs. heliocentrism, vitalists vs. mechanistic biology). In each case, defensive reactions disguised as methodological sophistication protected cherished beliefs.

790. [SCI-038] Natural Laws and Modal Space
   Sources: WORK-031 (lines 27-33)
   Thesis: The relationship between natural laws and what's metaphysically possible is a substantive question that PWS presupposes rather than answers.

791. [SCI-047] Laws cannot be defined except via counterfactuals
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: There is widespread agreement that the concept of a law of nature cannot be defined except in terms of counterfactuals - a law is inter alia something that supports counterfactuals. This creates circularity for the factualist analysis, which must understand counterfactuals in terms of laws.

792. [SCI-048] Probability definable from actual events only
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: The relevant kind of probability can be defined wholly in terms of what has happened (not what would happen and not even what must happen in a nomic sense). This avoids the circularity problem in analyzing counterfactuals.

793. [SCI-049] Critique of Humean analysis of laws
   Sources: WORK-037
   Thesis: The Humean analysis of laws as regularities is viciously circular. If states of affairs are themselves causal processes (as they must be), then defining causation as regular concomitance of states of affairs is circular. Additionally, temporal succession itself appears to be a causal notion, making the analysis doubly circular.

794. [SCI-050] Probability must be interpreted causally, not statistically
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: When we say the probability of an event is X%, this statement must be interpreted causally, not statistically. What is being said is that, given the laws of physics/nature and the construction of the system, it is a possibility (with degree X) that the event will occur, whether or not it ever actually occurs. Probability is determined by causal mechanisms and laws, not by observed frequencies.

   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7: Determinism and natural laws)
   Thesis: When it is said that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted CAUSALLY, not statistically. Probability is a function of laws and causal mechanisms, not observed frequencies.

796. [SCI-051] Statistics are evidence of probabilities but not themselves probabilities
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Statistics (observed frequencies) are evidence for what the probabilities are, but they are not identical with probabilities. The actual probability is determined by the underlying causal/nomic structure, and statistics can be misleading if they happen to diverge from that structure due to coincidence. Two worlds with identical laws have identical probabilities even if their statistics differ radically.

797. [SCI-051] Statistics are evidence for probability, not identical with probability
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. Frequency Theory (FT) wrongly identifies statistics with probability.

798. [SCI-052] The W1/W2 thought experiment refutes the Frequency Theory of Probability
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: Consider W1 and W2, two worlds with identical laws where computers have probability P of malfunctioning. In W1, the statistics match this probability. In W2, by sheer coincidence, no computer ever malfunctions (0% frequency). Frequency Theory says W2-probability = 0%, but this is false. The actual probability in both worlds is P (determined by the laws), even though the statistics differ. This refutes Frequency Theory.

799. [SCI-052] W1/W2 thought experiment refutes Frequency Theory
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: W1: laws say P(malfunction)=10%, statistics show 10%. W2: same laws, P(malfunction)=10%, but by coincidence statistics show 0%. Frequency Theory wrongly says P(W2)=0% but P(W1)=10%. Both actually have P=10% (determined by laws).

800. [SCI-053] Probability remains constant even when statistics are misleading due to coincidence
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: In a world with the same biological laws as ours, but where by sheer coincidence smokers never get cancer, doctors would be wrong to say smoking is harmless. The probability that a smoker will get cancer in that world is the SAME as in our world, because the probability is determined by the biological laws (which are identical), not by the observed frequencies (which differ).

801. [SCI-053] Smoking-cancer example refutes Frequency Theory
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: In a world with our biological laws but where by coincidence no smoker gets cancer, Frequency Theory says P(cancer|smoking)=0%. Wrong. P(cancer|smoking) = same as our world (determined by biological laws), regardless of coincidental statistics.

802. [SCI-054] Worlds with identical laws have identical probabilities regardless of statistical divergences
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: If two worlds W1 and W2 have the same laws of nature, they have the same probabilistic structure - the same probabilities for all events - even if their actual statistical frequencies happen to diverge dramatically due to coincidence. Probability supervenes on laws/causal mechanisms, not on observed patterns.

803. [SCI-054] Same laws entail same probabilities regardless of statistics
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: Worlds with identical laws of nature have identical probabilities, regardless of any statistical divergences caused by coincidence.

804. [SCI-055] Worlds with different causal/nomic structures have different probabilities even if event-sequences are identical
   Sources: WORK-014
   Thesis: If universe U1 is governed by laws while universe U2 is governed by pure chance (or different laws), then the probabilities of events in U1 and U2 are DIFFERENT, even if the actual sequence of events that occurs in each universe is identical. This is because probability is determined by the underlying causal/nomic structure, not by the pattern of events. U1's events have probabilities determined by laws; U2's events have probabilities determined by chance (or by different laws).

805. [SCI-055] Different causal/nomic structures entail different probabilities
   Sources: WORK-014 (Chapter 7)
   Thesis: If two universes have different causal/nomic structures (different laws), they have different probabilities, even if their event-sequences are observationally identical.
