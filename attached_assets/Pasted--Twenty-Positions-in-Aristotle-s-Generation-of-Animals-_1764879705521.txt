**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Generation of Animals* (De Generatione Animalium)**

1. This work explains the **efficient and formal causes of animal reproduction**—how new organisms come to be and acquire their specific forms.

2. **Sexual reproduction** involves the union of male and female contributions, which differ in kind rather than merely in degree.

3. The **male contributes form** (the efficient and formal cause) through semen; the **female contributes matter** (the material cause) through menstrual fluid or its analogue.

4. **Semen does not become part of the embryo**—it acts like a craftsman on material, imparting motion and form without contributing substance.

5. The formative power of semen is carried by **pneuma (vital breath)**—a substance analogous to aether that transmits soul-capacities.

6. The female provides **catamenia (menstrual blood)** as the matter to be shaped—it is concocted blood not yet fully refined into bodily parts.

7. **Conception occurs** when male semen acts on female matter, setting it and imparting the movements that will produce the embryo's parts.

8. **Spontaneous generation** occurs in some lower organisms when environmental heat acts on suitable matter without sexual union—nature still provides form.

9. The **heart forms first** in the embryo—it is the principle of life and the source from which other organs develop.

10. Development proceeds by **epigenesis, not preformation**—parts are generated successively, not simply enlarged from a pre-existing miniature.

11. The embryo acquires souls **successively**: first nutritive, then sensitive, finally (in humans) rational—each presupposes its predecessor.

12. The **rational soul enters from outside (thyrathen)**—unlike nutritive and sensitive soul, nous has no bodily organ and cannot arise from material processes.

13. **Heredity** is explained by the relative strength of male and female formative movements—offspring resemble whichever parent's motions dominate in each respect.

14. **Sex determination** depends on the heat and concoction of the semen—hotter, more concocted semen produces males; cooler produces females.

15. **Females are deformed males** in a limited sense—the female results when the male formative principle fails to fully master the material.

16. **Monstrosities (terata)** arise when formative movements go astray—nature's failures reveal what she normally accomplishes.

17. **Infertility** between species results from incompatibility of formative movements and material—hybrids like mules are typically sterile.

18. Different animals have different **gestation periods and developmental sequences**—these correlate with the perfection and heat of their natures.

19. **Twins and multiple births** occur when the matter is sufficient for more than one individual and the formative movements divide accordingly.

20. The entire process exhibits **teleological order**—generation exists for the sake of perpetuating the species, the closest approximation to eternity available to mortal beings.
