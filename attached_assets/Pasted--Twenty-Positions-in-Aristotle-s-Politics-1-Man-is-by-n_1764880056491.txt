**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Politics***

1. **Man is by nature a political animal (zoon politikon)**—the impulse toward political community is innate; one who lives outside the polis is either a beast or a god.

2. The **polis is prior to the individual** in the order of nature—just as the whole is prior to the part, the city is the condition for individual human flourishing.

3. The polis arises from **villages, which arise from households**—the progression is from basic reproductive and economic units to the self-sufficient community aimed at the good life.

4. The household includes three relations: **master-slave, husband-wife, parent-child**—each has its own proper form of rule.

5. **Slavery is natural** for those who lack the deliberative capacity for self-governance—they benefit from direction by natural masters. (Aristotle's most criticized doctrine.)

6. The **purpose of the polis is not mere life but the good life**—security and commerce are necessary conditions, but virtue and nobility are the true ends.

7. **Citizenship** in the strict sense is defined by participation in deliberative and judicial functions—the citizen shares in ruling and being ruled.

8. Constitutions are classified by **number of rulers** (one, few, many) and by **whether they rule for the common good or private interest**.

9. **Correct constitutions**: kingship (one for common good), aristocracy (few for common good), polity (many for common good).

10. **Deviant constitutions**: tyranny (one for private interest), oligarchy (few for private interest), democracy (many for private interest).

11. **Polity (politeia)** is a mixed constitution blending oligarchic and democratic elements—it empowers the middling citizens and is often the most stable.

12. The **middle class** is crucial for political stability—extremes of wealth and poverty breed faction; a large middle moderates conflict.

13. **Faction (stasis)** arises from disputes over justice—oligarchs think justice means inequality based on wealth; democrats think it means equality for all free citizens.

14. **Revolution** occurs when the balance of power no longer matches the constitutional form—each regime carries the seeds of its own destruction.

15. The **best constitution absolutely** would require ideal conditions—virtuous citizens, adequate resources, proper size; it aims at contemplative happiness.

16. The **best practicable constitution** must suit the character and circumstances of the actual population—the statesman adapts to available human material.

17. **Education is the statesman's most important task**—citizens must be trained in virtue appropriate to the constitution; character shapes regime stability.

18. Education should be **common and public**, not private—since the end of the city is one, the training of citizens must be unified.

19. The curriculum includes **letters, gymnastics, music, and drawing**—music is especially important for shaping character and enabling noble leisure.

20. The polis exists ultimately for the sake of **noble action and leisure (scholē)**—war is for peace, business for leisure, and leisure for philosophy and virtuous activity.
