## POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM THE DOCUMENT

### I. Core Theological Positions Attributed to Joseph Smith (and endorsed by the author as coherent)

1. **God was once a man** who became God through a process of spiritual development.

2. **Human beings can become demi-Gods or God-like** if they undergo a similar developmental process.

3. **Polytheism with hierarchy**: Although there is a single supreme God, there also exist several lesser gods.

4. **Rejection of creation ex nihilo**: God did not create the world out of nothing; he organized pre-existing materials.

5. **Eternal pre-existence of human beings**: A human being has always existed and will always exist; being human entails existing eternally, and existing eternally entails having always existed.

6. **God resembles a man; therefore he is a man**, albeit an exalted one.

7. **Jesus cannot be the son of God unless God is human**: If I am a human, my father is human; if my father is a panther, then I am a panther.

8. **Adam was created in God's image**—God created a replica of himself.

9. **If self-improvement is the road to Godliness, there are degrees of Godliness**, and besides God himself, there are many lesser Gods.

10. **The Hebrew term "baurau" means to organize, not to create ex nihilo**.

11. **Intelligence cannot possibly be created**. To create is to assemble, and there is no way to assemble intelligence. It either exists or it doesn't.

12. **Intelligence is eternal and self-existent**; there is no creation about it.

13. **Minds are "simples"** that cannot be created or destroyed and must therefore exist eternally in both directions.

14. **People are mini-Gods** and must therefore be immortal, given that God is immortal.

15. **"The head God brought forth the Gods"** in a grand council.

16. **God is not omniscient and never was**; God continues to learn and grow.

17. **God, though supreme, belonged to a "council of Gods"**—his relationship to council members was that of chairman to board-member, not lord to vassal.

18. **God's powers are limited**: He cannot do away with human freedom without doing away with human beings themselves.

19. **God has emotions because he is not all-powerful**. He is sufficiently lacking in power that his psychological constitution is still basically that of a human being.

20. **God is capable of changing**. A being that doesn't change at all is completely unresponsive to us and doesn't care for us.

21. **God is "immanent" in the spatiotemporal world**—present throughout it, like gravity or light.

22. **All reality is animate**; reality consists of consciousness individuated into discrete consciousnesses.

23. **God is but one of the many consciousnesses into which generalized consciousness is individuated**, with the qualification that he is the most important one.

24. **God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost are distinct entities** (trinitarianism, not unitarianism).

25. **God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost jointly constitute a single "Godhead"** despite being distinct.

26. **Both God and Jesus are corporeal**.

27. **God himself has a father**.

### II. Meta-Theological Positions (Author's Interpretive Framework)

28. **Theses 2-5 are corollaries of thesis 1** (God was once a man). The five theses form a logically unified system.

29. **Smith was presenting a vision, not conclusions of arguments**. The arguments, even if cogent, wouldn't lead anyone to accept such a vision.

30. **The merits of Smith's vision lie in the vision itself**, not in his arguments for it.

31. **Smith's philosophical arguments are more compelling than his exegetical arguments**.

32. **Smith produced exegetical arguments after philosophical insights had already led him to accept his positions**.

33. **Smith's philosophical insights were coded into a religious epiphany**—they would not otherwise have compelled him to break so completely from Christian orthodoxy.

34. **Smith likely arrived at his doctrines instantaneously** as part of a religious epiphany at age 14.

35. **Smith held his tongue over the next few decades**, speaking his mind only after acquiring standing and suspecting he had only a short time to live.

36. **Smith's central question**: What must God be like if human beings are to have the kind of relationship with him that they are supposed to have?

37. **In taking this question as primary, Smith broke with both Christian and philosophical tradition**.

38. **Smith's theology is not concerned with providing logical proofs of God's existence**. God is known through revelation or testimony.

39. **Attempts to prove God exists inevitably turn Him into an impersonal force or principle**, stripping him of his ability to have a relationship with us.

40. **If "God" is "a maximally perfect being," "a guarantor of natural law," or an "unmoved mover," he is unlikely to be sufficiently like us to have a meaningful relationship with us**.

41. **Smith attributes only as much power and sapience to God as is compatible with God being our guardian**.

42. **God needn't be absolutely powerful and knowing—only relatively so**. From the viewpoint of a religious person, God's primary function is to guide and care for us.

### III. Critique of Orthodox Christian Theology

43. **Orthodox Christian theology has incompatible mandates**: God is supposed to be all-knowing and all-powerful, yet also supposed to care about us.

44. **Orthodox Christianity suffers from incoherence because it starts with the supposition that God is perfect** and then tries to validate the presumption that God is emotionally invested in us.

45. **An all-powerful, all-knowing being wouldn't have emotions** and therefore wouldn't have any emotions concerning us.

46. **The concept of a sapient, all-powerful being is incoherent**.

47. **Sapience involves being responsive to change; being responsive to change involves being vulnerable; being vulnerable involves not being all-powerful**. Therefore, sapience is incompatible with omnipotence.

48. **According to orthodox Christian theology, God has a human son but is not himself human or otherwise biological, which is absurd**.

49. **God and Jesus, though related as father and son, are supposed to be one entity, which is absurd**.

50. **Orthodox Christian theology is incorrigibly incoherent**, and the reason is that it starts with the incoherent supposition that God is absolutely perfect.

51. **An all-knowing creature wouldn't care about us**, for it would have no emotions at all—emotion presupposes partiality and therefore ignorance.

52. **An all-powerful being wouldn't care about us**, for such a being would have no vulnerabilities and therefore none of the emotions that presuppose vulnerability.

53. **If one's starting point is that God is all powerful or all-knowing or otherwise perfect, there is no way to explain why he would care about us**.

### IV. Vindication of Smith's Theology

54. **Smith's theology is free from the incoherencies of orthodox Christian theology**.

55. **Smith starts with the supposition that God is our guardian**, attributing only as much power and sapience as is compatible with that supposition.

56. **A God that cares about us must be capable of changing and evolving**.

57. **God is a highly evolved person**—a being that started off as a person and developed into a God.

58. **Smith's theology, unlike orthodox Christian theology, is compatible with the fact that Jesus, God's alleged son, is a person**.

59. **God and Jesus are distinct in Smith's theology, as they must be, given that they are related as father and son**.

60. **Smith sidesteps the problem of theodicy** not by reconciling evil with an all-powerful God but by denying that God is all-powerful.

61. **Smith validates religious practice**: From the viewpoint of a religious person, God's primary function is to guide and care for us, so he must be relatively powerful and knowing, but needn't be absolutely so.

### V. On the Logic of Christian Polytheism

62. **Christianity isn't strictly monotheistic**: There is a single supreme divine being, but there are at least three divine beings.

63. **Smith is simply calling Christianity out on this fact**.

64. **If Jesus really is the son of God, then God is human. And if God is human, then humans can become gods**.

65. **Christianity may represent a revival of polytheistic instincts**.

66. **Early Doctors of the Church needed at least two divinities, God and Jesus**, since Jesus's divinity is the cornerstone of Christianity, but they did not want to openly embrace polytheism.

67. **Church Doctors affirmed, absurdly, that God and Jesus, though two, are one**.

68. **The Holy Ghost was posited as a way to let God and Jesus be one**: though obviously distinct, they both partake of this "Holy Spirit."

69. **After being posited, the Holy Ghost became a third divinity**, forcing Church Fathers to say that God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost, though three, are one.

### VI. On the Doctrine of Pre-Existence

70. **Minds can change but cannot be assembled**. Therefore, they either exist or they don't; if they do, they have always existed.

71. **God cannot bring people into existence**. God is omnipotent in the sense that he can do whatever can be done, not in the sense that he can do what is logically impossible.

72. **The doctrine of pre-existence is heretical** relative to Christian orthodoxy.

73. **The doctrine implies that God's power is limited**.

74. **The doctrine puts people on the same footing as God**. If people have always existed alongside God, they are in some respect his peers.

75. **The doctrine has roots in Western philosophy**: Leibniz held that minds are "monads" that cannot be created or destroyed; Plato held that minds are "simples" that exist eternally.

### VII. Historiographical Positions

76. **The history of Mormon theology is a history of attempts to run away from Smith's thought under the pretext of developing it**.

77. **Post-Smith Mormon theologians were less willing than Smith to depart from Christian orthodoxy** and therefore had difficulty compatibilizing Smith's doctrines with what they wanted Mormon theology to be.

78. **Mormon theologians were under pressure to accept Smith's doctrines** given that KFD is to a large extent definitive of Mormon theology.

79. **Mormon theology as a whole has remained in a limbo** between Smith's own theology and softened versions of it.

80. **Even the most "Smith-positive" Mormon theologians, like Orson Pratt, repudiate the very essence of Smith's theology**—the contention that God was once a man.

81. **Pratt's position (pantheism coupled with sentient matter) is very far from—and logically incompatible with—Smith's position that some person became what is now God**.

82. **This shows how intensely Mormon theologians resisted Smith's doctrines**, even while having to operate within a framework at least partially defined by them.

83. **KFD did more than any of Smith's previous sermons to shape Mormon thought**, because in it Smith united his positions into a single coherent vision.

84. **Smith had publicly endorsed each of his main doctrines before giving the KFD**, which is why many in the early Mormon Church regarded him as a "heretic" and "blasphemer."

85. **Despite intense pressure, Smith never softened his positions**.

### VIII. Critique of Samuel Brown's Article on Phelps's "Paracletes"

86. **"Paracletes" does not provide a useful illustration of Smith's thought: it actually obscures it**.

87. **The material on which "Paracletes" is based is drawn from the periphery of Smith's thought**, but it treats it as central.

88. **"Paracletes" makes Smith's theology seem cartoonish and arbitrary**.

89. **"Paracletes" spins off a defensible idea into an L. Ron Hubbard-style fantasy**.

90. **Brown's contention that "Paracletes" provides a crucial window on the complex network of beliefs undergirding Smith's theology is not accurate**.

91. **Smith's theology is cogent and carefully thought-out**, not an absurd fairy tale spun out of whole cloth (contrary to what Phelps's fiction suggests).

---

### IX. Methodological Positions

92. **Works discussing theological development should be examined in chronological order**, noting where a given work either builds on or diverges from its predecessors.

93. **The assumption that the Bible is literally accurate represents one possible starting point** for Smith's reasoning.

94. **Van Hale's position that Smith arrived at his doctrines gradually is consistent with Smith's sermons**—but another possibility is that Smith had already completely accepted them but refrained from stating them directly.

95. **A follow-up paper is warranted** investigating the question: Is anything left of Smith's thought in contemporary Mormon theology?

---

### X. Summary Aphorism (endorsed as the essence of Smith's theology)

96. **"As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become"** (Lorenzo Snow's aphorism, endorsed as capturing the essence of Smith's theology).

97. **God is an evolved man, and a human being can evolve into a state of relative Godliness**.

98. **Godliness comes in degrees**; there are, or could be, various beings having varying degrees of God-status.

99. **Unless God is at least partly human, he is unlikely to have the ability or inclination to function as our guardian**.
