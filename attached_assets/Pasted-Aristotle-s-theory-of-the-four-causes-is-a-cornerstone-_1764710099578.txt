Aristotle's theory of the four causes is a cornerstone of his philosophy, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the existence and change of natural objects. These causes are the material cause, the formal cause, the efficient cause, and the final cause. Each of these plays a crucial role in explaining why a thing is the way it is and how it achieves its purpose or end. Central to this framework is the concept of final causality, which is intricately connected to Aristotle's ideas of actuality and potentiality, particularly in his biological and metaphysical works.

The material cause refers to the substance or matter that composes something. For example, the material cause of a statue is the bronze or marble from which it is made. In biology, the material cause of a living organism includes the physical substances that constitute its body, such as flesh and bone. “Bone, flesh, and the like, are constituted out of the primary substances.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) Thus, understanding the material cause involves identifying the physical components that provide the potential for a thing to exist in a particular form.

The formal cause is the form or essence of a thing, which gives it its identity. It is the arrangement or structure that makes a thing what it is. For example, the formal cause of a statue is the shape or design given by the sculptor, which differentiates it from a mere block of marble. In living beings, the formal cause is their specific biological structure and the functions that define their species. “If now this something that constitutes the form of the living being be the soul, or part of the soul, or something that without the soul cannot exist; as would seem to be the case, seeing at any rate that when the soul departs, what is left is no longer a living animal.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) Here, Aristotle suggests that the soul, or the form, is integral to the identity of living beings.

The efficient cause is the agent or force that brings something into being. It is akin to the modern concept of causation, where one thing leads to another. The efficient cause of a statue is the sculptor who carves it. In the realm of biology, the efficient cause might be the parents who generate offspring or the process of development leading to the formation of organs. “There must be an eternal unmoved substance, separate from sensible things... This substance must be actuality; for if it were potentiality it might not be, and then there would be nothing.” (Metaphysics Book XII) This quote highlights the role of an unmoved mover as an ultimate efficient cause in the cosmos.

The final cause, or telos, is the purpose or end for which a thing exists. It is the reason why something is done or made. For a statue, the final cause might be to honor a deity or commemorate an event. In biology, the final cause is seen in the functions and purposes of organisms and their parts, such as the eye being for seeing. “Again, whenever there is plainly some final end, to which a motion tends should nothing stand in the way, we always say that such final end is the aim or purpose of the motion; and from this it is evident that there must be a something or other really existing, corresponding to what we call by the name of Nature.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) This highlights the intrinsic purposes found in natural processes.

Final causality is deeply connected to Aristotle’s concepts of actuality and potentiality. Potentiality refers to the capacity for change or the potential to develop into a particular form, while actuality is the realization or fulfillment of that potential. In the biological context, a seed has the potential to become a tree, and the tree is the actuality of that potential. “For germ and perfected progeny are related as the developmental process and the result. Anterior, however, to both germ and product is the organism from which the germ was derived.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) This illustrates how a germ or seed contains potential that is actualized through development.

The relationship between final causality and actuality versus potentiality can be seen in the way natural processes unfold towards a specific end. For instance, the final cause of an acorn is to become an oak tree, and its potentiality is directed toward this end. The actualization of this potential involves the growth and development of the acorn into a fully formed tree. “The final cause is some definite form or similar end; for man generates man, and plant generates plant, in each case out of the underlying material.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) This demonstrates how the final cause guides the actualization of potential into a specific form or end.

In metaphysics, Aristotle extends this framework to the universe, positing that there must be a final cause for all motion and change. He introduces the concept of the Unmoved Mover, an eternal and unchanging substance that serves as the ultimate final cause of the cosmos. This Unmoved Mover, being pure actuality, does not change or move, but rather attracts everything towards itself as a perfect end. “Everything that is in motion must be moved by something.” (Physics) This indicates that motion requires a cause, ultimately leading to the concept of the Unmoved Mover as the final cause.

The Unmoved Mover is pure actuality, embodying the ultimate realization of potentiality without being subject to change. It is the final cause that provides the purpose and direction for all things, even though it does not directly interact with the world. “There must be an eternal unmoved substance, separate from sensible things... This substance must be actuality; for if it were potentiality it might not be, and then there would be nothing.” (Metaphysics Book XII) Here, Aristotle underscores the necessity of a pure actuality as the basis for existence and motion.

In conclusion, Aristotle’s theory of the four causes provides a comprehensive explanation of why things are the way they are, focusing on material, formal, efficient, and final causes. Final causality, in particular, is essential in understanding the transition from potentiality to actuality, as it represents the purpose or end toward which natural processes aim. This framework is evident in Aristotle’s biological studies, where the purposes of various organisms and their parts are explored, and in his metaphysical inquiries, where the concept of the Unmoved Mover as a final cause is introduced. “For primary cause constitutes the nature of an animal much more than does its matter.” (The Complete Aristotle Part10) Through this lens, actuality and potentiality are seen as stages in the realization of purpose, with final causality guiding the process toward completion and fulfillment.
