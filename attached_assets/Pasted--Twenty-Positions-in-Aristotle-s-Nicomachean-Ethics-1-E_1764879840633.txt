**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics***

1. Every action and pursuit aims at some **good**—the good is that at which all things aim.

2. The highest human good is **eudaimonia (happiness, flourishing)**—it is complete, self-sufficient, and chosen for its own sake.

3. Eudaimonia is not pleasure, honor, or wealth—it is **activity of the soul in accordance with virtue**, and if there are multiple virtues, in accordance with the best and most complete.

4. The **function (ergon) of a human being** is rational activity—just as a good harpist plays the harp well, a good human lives and acts according to reason well.

5. **Virtue (aretē) is a hexis (stable disposition)**—not a mere feeling or capacity, but a settled state of character acquired through habituation.

6. **Moral virtue is a mean between two vices**—one of excess, one of deficiency; courage lies between recklessness and cowardice.

7. The mean is **relative to us**, not arithmetic—what counts as temperate eating differs for an athlete and an invalid.

8. **Virtuous action requires choice (prohairesis)**—one must know what one is doing, choose it for its own sake, and act from a firm disposition.

9. We are **responsible for our characters**—though habit shapes us, we are the co-authors of our dispositions through our voluntary actions.

10. **Practical wisdom (phronesis)** is the intellectual virtue that enables correct deliberation about what conduces to the good life—it is inseparable from moral virtue.

11. The moral virtues include **courage, temperance, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, proper ambition, good temper, friendliness, truthfulness, wit, and justice**.

12. **Justice** is the complete virtue in relation to others—it has both a general sense (lawfulness) and a specific sense (fairness in distribution and rectification).

13. **Akrasia (weakness of will)** is possible—one can know the good yet fail to act on it, overcome by passion; this is neither full virtue nor full vice.

14. **Pleasure accompanies unimpeded virtuous activity**—it is not the good itself, but a natural concomitant that completes good activity like bloom on youth.

15. **Friendship (philia)** is essential to the good life—humans are social beings, and no one would choose to live without friends even with all other goods.

16. There are three kinds of friendship: for **utility, pleasure, and virtue**—only the last is complete and enduring, based on mutual recognition of good character.

17. The happy person needs **external goods**—a measure of health, wealth, friends, and good fortune; virtue alone does not suffice for full flourishing.

18. **Contemplation (theōria)** is the highest human activity—it is most continuous, self-sufficient, loved for its own sake, and exercises our most divine element.

19. The **contemplative life is happiest**—it most fully realizes the divine element in us; the life of moral virtue is happy in a secondary way.

20. Ethics is a branch of **political science**—individual flourishing requires the right social conditions; the lawgiver must understand virtue to cultivate it in citizens.
