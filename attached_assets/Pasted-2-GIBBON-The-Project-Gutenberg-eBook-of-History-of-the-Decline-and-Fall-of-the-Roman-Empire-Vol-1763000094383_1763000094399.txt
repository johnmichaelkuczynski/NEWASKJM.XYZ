      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part I.

     The Conduct Of The Roman Government Towards The Christians, From
     The Reign Of Nero To That Of Constantine. 1111


      1111 (return) [ The sixteenth chapter I cannot help considering
      as a very ingenious and specious, but very disgraceful
      extenuation of the cruelties perpetrated by the Roman magistrates
      against the Christians. It is written in the most contemptibly
      factious spirit of prejudice against the sufferers; it is
      unworthy of a philosopher and of humanity. Let the narrative of
      Cyprian’s death be examined. He had to relate the murder of an
      innocent man of advanced age, and in a station deemed venerable
      by a considerable body of the provincials of Africa, put to death
      because he refused to sacrifice to Jupiter. Instead of pointing
      the indignation of posterity against such an atrocious act of
      tyranny, he dwells, with visible art, on the small circumstances
      of decorum and politeness which attended this murder, and which
      he relates with as much parade as if they were the most important
      particulars of the event. Dr. Robertson has been the subject of
      much blame for his real or supposed lenity towards the Spanish
      murderers and tyrants in America. That the sixteenth chapter of
      Mr. G. did not excite the same or greater disapprobation, is a
      proof of the unphilosophical and indeed fanatical animosity
      against Christianity, which was so prevalent during the latter
      part of the eighteenth century.—_Mackintosh:_ see Life, i. p.
      244, 245.]

      If we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion,
      the sanctity of its moral precepts, and the innocent as well as
      austere lives of the greater number of those who during the first
      ages embraced the faith of the gospel, we should naturally
      suppose, that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received
      with due reverence, even by the unbelieving world; that the
      learned and the polite, however they may deride the miracles,
      would have esteemed the virtues, of the new sect; and that the
      magistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected an
      order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws,
      though they declined the active cares of war and government. If,
      on the other hand, we recollect the universal toleration of
      Polytheism, as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the
      people, the incredulity of philosophers, and the policy of the
      Roman senate and emperors, we are at a loss to discover what new
      offence the Christians had committed, what new provocation could
      exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity, and what new
      motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld without concern
      a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their
      gentle sway, to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their
      subjects, who had chosen for themselves a singular but an
      inoffensive mode of faith and worship.

      The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a
      more stern and intolerant character, to oppose the progress of
      Christianity. About fourscore years after the death of Christ,
      his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence
      of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character, and
      according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom
      and justice of his general administration. The apologies which
      were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled
      with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christians, who
      obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty, of conscience,
      were alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded
      from the common benefits of their auspicious government. The
      deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care; and
      from the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme
      power, the governors of the church have been no less diligently
      employed in displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the
      conduct, of their Pagan adversaries. To separate (if it be
      possible) a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an
      undigested mass of fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear
      and rational manner, the causes, the extent, the duration, and
      the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the
      first Christians were exposed, is the design of the present
      chapter. 1222

      1222 (return) [ The history of the first age of Christianity is
      only found in the Acts of the Apostles, and in order to speak of
      the first persecutions experienced by the Christians, that book
      should naturally have been consulted; those persecutions, then
      limited to individuals and to a narrow sphere, interested only
      the persecuted, and have been related by them alone. Gibbon
      making the persecutions ascend no higher than Nero, has entirely
      omitted those which preceded this epoch, and of which St. Luke
      has preserved the memory. The only way to justify this omission
      was, to attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles; for,
      if authentic, they must necessarily be consulted and quoted. Now,
      antiquity has left very few works of which the authenticity is so
      well established as that of the Acts of the Apostles. (See
      Lardner’s Cred. of Gospel Hist. part iii.) It is therefore,
      without sufficient reason, that Gibbon has maintained silence
      concerning the narrative of St. Luke, and this omission is not
      without importance.—G.]

      The sectaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear
      animated with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are
      seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or
      candidly to appreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often
      escape the impartial and discerning view even of those who are
      placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution. A
      reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards
      the primitive Christians, which may appear the more specious and
      probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of
      Polytheism. It has already been observed, that the religious
      concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit
      assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for
      their respective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be
      expected, that they would unite with indignation against any sect
      or people which should separate itself from the communion of
      mankind, and claiming the exclusive possession of divine
      knowledge, should disdain every form of worship, except its own,
      as impious and idolatrous. The rights of toleration were held by
      mutual indulgence: they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the
      accustomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly
      refused by the Jews, and by them alone, the consideration of the
      treatment which they experienced from the Roman magistrates, will
      serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by
      facts, and will lead us to discover the true causes of the
      persecution of Christianity.

      Without repeating what has already been mentioned of the
      reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of
      Jerusalem, we shall only observe, that the destruction of the
      temple and city was accompanied and followed by every
      circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors,
      and authorize religious persecution by the most specious
      arguments of political justice and the public safety. From the
      reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a
      fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke
      out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is
      shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they
      committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where
      they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting
      natives; 1 and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation
      which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of
      fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render
      them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but
      of human kind. 2 The enthusiasm of the Jews was supported by the
      opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an
      idolatrous master; and by the flattering promise which they
      derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Messiah
      would soon arise, destined to break their fetters, and to invest
      the favorites of heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by
      announcing himself as their long-expected deliverer, and by
      calling on all the descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of
      Israel, that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army,
      with which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor
      Hadrian. 3

      1 (return) [ In Cyrene, they massacred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus,
      240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude. Many of these unhappy
      victims were sawn asunder, according to a precedent to which
      David had given the sanction of his example. The victorious Jews
      devoured the flesh, licked up the blood, and twisted the entrails
      like a girdle round their bodies. See Dion Cassius, l. lxviii. p.
      1145. * Note: Some commentators, among them Reimar, in his notes
      on Dion Cassius think that the hatred of the Romans against the
      Jews has led the historian to exaggerate the cruelties committed
      by the latter. Don. Cass. lxviii. p. 1146.—G.]

      2 (return) [ Without repeating the well-known narratives of
      Josephus, we may learn from Dion, (l. lxix. p. 1162,) that in
      Hadrian’s war 580,000 Jews were cut off by the sword, besides an
      infinite number which perished by famine, by disease, and by
      fire.]

      3 (return) [ For the sect of the Zealots, see Basnage, Histoire
      des Juifs, l. i. c. 17; for the characters of the Messiah,
      according to the Rabbis, l. v. c. 11, 12, 13; for the actions of
      Barchochebas, l. vii. c. 12. (Hist. of Jews iii. 115, &c.)—M.]

      Notwithstanding these repeated provocations, the resentment of
      the Roman princes expired after the victory; nor were their
      apprehensions continued beyond the period of war and danger. By
      the general indulgence of polytheism, and by the mild temper of
      Antoninus Pius, the Jews were restored to their ancient
      privileges, and once more obtained the permission of circumcising
      their children, with the easy restraint, that they should never
      confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the
      Hebrew race. 4 The numerous remains of that people, though they
      were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem, were
      permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments
      both in Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of
      Rome, to enjoy municipal honors, and to obtain at the same time
      an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of
      society. The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a
      legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was
      instituted by the vanquished sect. The patriarch, who had fixed
      his residence at Tiberias, was empowered to appoint his
      subordinate ministers and apostles, to exercise a domestic
      jurisdiction, and to receive from his dispersed brethren an
      annual contribution. 5 New synagogues were frequently erected in
      the principal cities of the empire; and the sabbaths, the fasts,
      and the festivals, which were either commanded by the Mosaic law,
      or enjoined by the traditions of the Rabbis, were celebrated in
      the most solemn and public manner. 6 Such gentle treatment
      insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews. Awakened from
      their dream of prophecy and conquest, they assumed the behavior
      of peaceable and industrious subjects. Their irreconcilable
      hatred of mankind, instead of flaming out in acts of blood and
      violence, evaporated in less dangerous gratifications. They
      embraced every opportunity of overreaching the idolaters in
      trade; and they pronounced secret and ambiguous imprecations
      against the haughty kingdom of Edom. 7

      4 (return) [ It is to Modestinus, a Roman lawyer (l. vi.
      regular.) that we are indebted for a distinct knowledge of the
      Edict of Antoninus. See Casaubon ad Hist. August. p. 27.]

      5 (return) [ See Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, l. iii. c. 2, 3.
      The office of Patriarch was suppressed by Theodosius the
      younger.]

      6 (return) [ We need only mention the Purim, or deliverance of
      the Jews from he rage of Haman, which, till the reign of
      Theodosius, was celebrated with insolent triumph and riotous
      intemperance. Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 17, l. viii. c.
      6.]

      7 (return) [ According to the false Josephus, Tsepho, the
      grandson of Esau, conducted into Italy the army of Eneas, king of
      Carthage. Another colony of Idumæans, flying from the sword of
      David, took refuge in the dominions of Romulus. For these, or for
      other reasons of equal weight, the name of Edom was applied by
      the Jews to the Roman empire. * Note: The false Josephus is a
      romancer of very modern date, though some of these legends are
      probably more ancient. It may be worth considering whether many
      of the stories in the Talmud are not history in a figurative
      disguise, adopted from prudence. The Jews might dare to say many
      things of Rome, under the significant appellation of Edom, which
      they feared to utter publicly. Later and more ignorant ages took
      literally, and perhaps embellished, what was intelligible among
      the generation to which it was addressed. Hist. of Jews, iii.
      131. ——The false Josephus has the inauguration of the emperor,
      with the seven electors and apparently the pope assisting at the
      coronation! Pref. page xxvi.—M.]

      Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored
      by their sovereign and by their fellow-subjects, enjoyed,
      however, the free exercise of their unsocial religion, there must
      have existed some other cause, which exposed the disciples of
      Christ to those severities from which the posterity of Abraham
      was exempt. The difference between them is simple and obvious;
      but, according to the sentiments of antiquity, it was of the
      highest importance. The Jews were a _nation;_ the Christians were
      a _sect:_ and if it was natural for every community to respect
      the sacred institutions of their neighbors, it was incumbent on
      them to persevere in those of their ancestors. The voice of
      oracles, the precepts of philosophers, and the authority of the
      laws, unanimously enforced this national obligation. By their
      lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might provoke the
      Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race. By
      disdaining the intercourse of other nations, they might deserve
      their contempt. The laws of Moses might be for the most part
      frivolous or absurd; yet, since they had been received during
      many ages by a large society, his followers were justified by the
      example of mankind; and it was universally acknowledged, that
      they had a right to practise what it would have been criminal in
      them to neglect. But this principle, which protected the Jewish
      synagogue, afforded not any favor or security to the primitive
      church. By embracing the faith of the gospel, the Christians
      incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable
      offence. They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education,
      violated the religious institutions of their country, and
      presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as
      true, or had reverenced as sacred. Nor was this apostasy (if we
      may use the expression) merely of a partial or local kind; since
      the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt
      or Syria, would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of
      Athens or Carthage. Every Christian rejected with contempt the
      superstitions of his family, his city, and his province. The
      whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any
      communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of mankind.
      It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the
      inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment. Though his
      situation might excite the pity, his arguments could never reach
      the understanding, either of the philosophic or of the believing
      part of the Pagan world. To their apprehensions, it was no less a
      matter of surprise, that any individuals should entertain
      scruples against complying with the established mode of worship,
      than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners,
      the dress, 8111 or the language of their native country. 8

      8 (return) [ From the arguments of Celsus, as they are
      represented and refuted by Origen, (l. v. p. 247—259,) we may
      clearly discover the distinction that was made between the Jewish
      _people_ and the Christian _sect_. See, in the Dialogue of
      Minucius Felix, (c. 5, 6,) a fair and not inelegant description
      of the popular sentiments, with regard to the desertion of the
      established worship.]

      8111 (return) [ In all this there is doubtless much truth; yet
      does not the more important difference lie on the surface? The
      Christians made many converts the Jews but few. Had the Jewish
      been equally a proselyting religion would it not have encountered
      as violent persecution?—M.]

      The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment; and
      the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous
      imputation of impiety. Malice and prejudice concurred in
      representing the Christians as a society of atheists, who, by the
      most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire,
      had merited the severest animadversion of the civil magistrate.
      They had separated themselves (they gloried in the confession)
      from every mode of superstition which was received in any part of
      the globe by the various temper of polytheism: but it was not
      altogether so evident what deity, or what form of worship, they
      had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity. The pure
      and sublime idea which they entertained of the Supreme Being
      escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude, who were at
      a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary God, that was neither
      represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol, nor was
      adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals, of
      altars and sacrifices. 9 The sages of Greece and Rome, who had
      elevated their minds to the contemplation of the existence and
      attributes of the First Cause, were induced by reason or by
      vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the
      privilege of this philosophical devotion. 10 They were far from
      admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth, but
      they considered them as flowing from the original disposition of
      human nature; and they supposed that any popular mode of faith
      and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the
      senses, would, in proportion as it receded from superstition,
      find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy,
      and the visions of fanaticism. The careless glance which men of
      wit and learning condescended to cast on the Christian
      revelation, served only to confirm their hasty opinion, and to
      persuade them that the principle, which they might have revered,
      of the Divine Unity, was defaced by the wild enthusiasm, and
      annihilated by the airy speculations, of the new sectaries. The
      author of a celebrated dialogue, which has been attributed to
      Lucian, whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the
      Trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt, betrays his own
      ignorance of the weakness of human reason, and of the inscrutable
      nature of the divine perfections. 11

      interlocutor goes on to make a distinction in favor of the Jews,

      It might appear less surprising, that the founder of Christianity
      should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and a
      prophet, but that he should be adored as a God. The Polytheists
      were disposed to adopt every article of faith, which seemed to
      offer any resemblance, however distant or imperfect, with the
      popular mythology; and the legends of Bacchus, of Hercules, and
      of Æsculapius, had, in some measure, prepared their imagination
      for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form. 12 But
      they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the
      temples of those ancient heroes, who, in the infancy of the
      world, had invented arts, instituted laws, and vanquished the
      tyrants or monsters who infested the earth, in order to choose
      for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure
      teacher, who, in a recent age, and among a barbarous people, had
      fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen, or
      to the jealousy of the Roman government. The Pagan multitude,
      reserving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone, rejected
      the inestimable present of life and immortality, which was
      offered to mankind by Jesus of Nazareth. His mild constancy in
      the midst of cruel and voluntary sufferings, his universal
      benevolence, and the sublime simplicity of his actions and
      character, were insufficient, in the opinion of those carnal men,
      to compensate for the want of fame, of empire, and of success;
      and whilst they refused to acknowledge his stupendous triumph
      over the powers of darkness and of the grave, they
      misrepresented, or they insulted, the equivocal birth, wandering
      life, and ignominious death, of the divine Author of
      Christianity. 13

      12 (return) [ According to Justin Martyr, (Apolog. Major, c.
      70-85,) the dæmon who had gained some imperfect knowledge of the

      deter, though by different means, both the people and the
      philosophers from embracing the faith of Christ.]

      13 (return) [ In the first and second books of Origen, Celsus
      treats the birth and character of our Savior with the most
      impious contempt. The orator Libanius praises Porphyry and Julian
      for confuting the folly of a sect., which styles a dead man of
      Palestine, God, and the Son of God. Socrates, Hist. Ecclesiast.
      iii. 23.]

      The personal guilt which every Christian had contracted, in thus
      preferring his private sentiment to the national religion, was
      aggravated in a very high degree by the number and union of the
      criminals. It is well known, and has been already observed, that
      Roman policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any
      association among its subjects; and that the privileges of
      private corporations, though formed for the most harmless or
      beneficial purposes, were bestowed with a very sparing hand. 14
      The religious assemblies of the Christians who had separated
      themselves from the public worship, appeared of a much less
      innocent nature; they were illegal in their principle, and in
      their consequences might become dangerous; nor were the emperors
      conscious that they violated the laws of justice, when, for the
      peace of society, they prohibited those secret and sometimes
      nocturnal meetings. 15 The pious disobedience of the Christians
      made their conduct, or perhaps their designs, appear in a much
      more serious and criminal light; and the Roman princes, who might
      perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready
      submission, deeming their honor concerned in the execution of
      their commands, sometimes attempted, by rigorous punishments, to
      subdue this independent spirit, which boldly acknowledged an
      authority superior to that of the magistrate. The extent and
      duration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it
      everyday more deserving of his animadversion. We have already
      seen that the active and successful zeal of the Christians had
      insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every
      city of the empire. The new converts seemed to renounce their
      family and country, that they might connect themselves in an
      indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society, which every
      where assumed a different character from the rest of mankind.
      Their gloomy and austere aspect, their abhorrence of the common
      business and pleasures of life, and their frequent predictions of
      impending calamities, 16 inspired the Pagans with the
      apprehension of some danger, which would arise from the new sect,
      the more alarming as it was the more obscure. “Whatever,” says
      Pliny, “may be the principle of their conduct, their inflexible
      obstinacy appeared deserving of punishment.” 17

      conflagration, &c., provoked those Pagans whom they did not

      secret. See Mosheim, 413.]

      The precautions with which the disciples of Christ performed the
      offices of religion were at first dictated by fear and necessity;
      but they were continued from choice. By imitating the awful
      secrecy which reigned in the Eleusinian mysteries, the Christians
      had flattered themselves that they should render their sacred
      institutions more respectable in the eyes of the Pagan world. 18
      But the event, as it often happens to the operations of subtile
      policy, deceived their wishes and their expectations. It was
      concluded, that they only concealed what they would have blushed
      to disclose. Their mistaken prudence afforded an opportunity for
      malice to invent, and for suspicious credulity to believe, the
      horrid tales which described the Christians as the most wicked of
      human kind, who practised in their dark recesses every
      abomination that a depraved fancy could suggest, and who
      solicited the favor of their unknown God by the sacrifice of
      every moral virtue. There were many who pretended to confess or
      to relate the ceremonies of this abhorred society. It was
      asserted, “that a new-born infant, entirely covered over with
      flour, was presented, like some mystic symbol of initiation, to
      the knife of the proselyte, who unknowingly inflicted many a
      secret and mortal wound on the innocent victim of his error; that
      as soon as the cruel deed was perpetrated, the sectaries drank up
      the blood, greedily tore asunder the quivering members, and
      pledged themselves to eternal secrecy, by a mutual consciousness
      of guilt. It was as confidently affirmed, that this inhuman
      sacrifice was succeeded by a suitable entertainment, in which
      intemperance served as a provocative to brutal lust; till, at the
      appointed moment, the lights were suddenly extinguished, shame
      was banished, nature was forgotten; and, as accident might
      direct, the darkness of the night was polluted by the incestuous
      commerce of sisters and brothers, of sons and of mothers.” 19

      But the perusal of the ancient apologies was sufficient to remove
      even the slightest suspicion from the mind of a candid adversary.
      The Christians, with the intrepid security of innocence, appeal
      from the voice of rumor to the equity of the magistrates. They
      acknowledge, that if any proof can be produced of the crimes
      which calumny has imputed to them, they are worthy of the most
      severe punishment. They provoke the punishment, and they
      challenge the proof. At the same time they urge, with equal truth
      and propriety, that the charge is not less devoid of probability,
      than it is destitute of evidence; they ask, whether any one can
      seriously believe that the pure and holy precepts of the gospel,
      which so frequently restrain the use of the most lawful
      enjoyments, should inculcate the practice of the most abominable
      crimes; that a large society should resolve to dishonor itself in
      the eyes of its own members; and that a great number of persons
      of either sex, and every age and character, insensible to the
      fear of death or infamy, should consent to violate those
      principles which nature and education had imprinted most deeply
      in their minds. 20 Nothing, it should seem, could weaken the
      force or destroy the effect of so unanswerable a justification,
      unless it were the injudicious conduct of the apologists
      themselves, who betrayed the common cause of religion, to gratify
      their devout hatred to the domestic enemies of the church. It was
      sometimes faintly insinuated, and sometimes boldly asserted, that
      the same bloody sacrifices, and the same incestuous festivals,
      which were so falsely ascribed to the orthodox believers, were in
      reality celebrated by the Marcionites, by the Carpocratians, and
      by several other sects of the Gnostics, who, notwithstanding they
      might deviate into the paths of heresy, were still actuated by
      the sentiments of men, and still governed by the precepts of
      Christianity. 21 Accusations of a similar kind were retorted upon
      the church by the schismatics who had departed from its
      communion, 22 and it was confessed on all sides, that the most
      scandalous licentiousness of manners prevailed among great
      numbers of those who affected the name of Christians. A Pagan
      magistrate, who possessed neither leisure nor abilities to
      discern the almost imperceptible line which divides the orthodox
      faith from heretical pravity, might easily have imagined that
      their mutual animosity had extorted the discovery of their common
      guilt. It was fortunate for the repose, or at least for the
      reputation, of the first Christians, that the magistrates
      sometimes proceeded with more temper and moderation than is
      usually consistent with religious zeal, and that they reported,
      as the impartial result of their judicial inquiry, that the
      sectaries, who had deserted the established worship, appeared to
      them sincere in their professions, and blameless in their
      manners; however they might incur, by their absurd and excessive
      superstition, the censure of the laws. 23

      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part II.


      History, which undertakes to record the transactions of the past,
      for the instruction of future ages, would ill deserve that
      honorable office, if she condescended to plead the cause of
      tyrants, or to justify the maxims of persecution. It must,
      however, be acknowledged, that the conduct of the emperors who
      appeared the least favorable to the primitive church, is by no
      means so criminal as that of modern sovereigns, who have employed
      the arm of violence and terror against the religious opinions of
      any part of their subjects. From their reflections, or even from
      their own feelings, a Charles V. or a Lewis XIV. might have
      acquired a just knowledge of the rights of conscience, of the
      obligation of faith, and of the innocence of error. But the
      princes and magistrates of ancient Rome were strangers to those
      principles which inspired and authorized the inflexible obstinacy
      of the Christians in the cause of truth, nor could they
      themselves discover in their own breasts any motive which would
      have prompted them to refuse a legal, and as it were a natural,
      submission to the sacred institutions of their country. The same
      reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt, must have tended
      to abate the vigor, of their persecutions. As they were actuated,
      not by the furious zeal of bigots, but by the temperate policy of
      legislators, contempt must often have relaxed, and humanity must
      frequently have suspended, the execution of those laws which they
      enacted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ. From
      the general view of their character and motives we might
      naturally conclude: I. That a considerable time elapsed before
      they considered the new sectaries as an object deserving of the
      attention of government. II. That in the conviction of any of
      their subjects who were accused of so very singular a crime, they
      proceeded with caution and reluctance. III. That they were
      moderate in the use of punishments; and, IV. That the afflicted
      church enjoyed many intervals of peace and tranquility.
      Notwithstanding the careless indifference which the most copious
      and the most minute of the Pagan writers have shown to the
      affairs of the Christians, 24 it may still be in our power to
      confirm each of these probable suppositions, by the evidence of
      authentic facts.

      24 (return) [ In the various compilation of the Augustan History,
      (a part of which was composed under the reign of Constantine,)
      there are not six lines which relate to the Christians; nor has
      the diligence of Xiphilin discovered their name in the large
      history of Dion Cassius. * Note: The greater part of the Augustan
      History is dedicated to Diocletian. This may account for the
      silence of its authors concerning Christianity. The notices that
      occur are almost all in the lives composed under the reign of
      Constantine. It may fairly be concluded, from the language which
      he had into the mouth of Mæcenas, that Dion was an enemy to all
      innovations in religion. (See Gibbon, _infra_, note 105.) In
      fact, when the silence of Pagan historians is noticed, it should
      be remembered how meagre and mutilated are all the extant
      histories of the period—M.]

      1. By the wise dispensation of Providence, a mysterious veil was
      cast over the infancy of the church, which, till the faith of the
      Christians was matured, and their numbers were multiplied, served
      to protect them not only from the malice but even from the
      knowledge of the Pagan world. The slow and gradual abolition of
      the Mosaic ceremonies afforded a safe and innocent disguise to
      the more early proselytes of the gospel. As they were, for the
      greater part, of the race of Abraham, they were distinguished by
      the peculiar mark of circumcision, offered up their devotions in
      the Temple of Jerusalem till its final destruction, and received
      both the Law and the Prophets as the genuine inspirations of the
      Deity. The Gentile converts, who by a spiritual adoption had been
      associated to the hope of Israel, were likewise confounded under
      the garb and appearance of Jews, 25 and as the Polytheists paid
      less regard to articles of faith than to the external worship,
      the new sect, which carefully concealed, or faintly announced,
      its future greatness and ambition, was permitted to shelter
      itself under the general toleration which was granted to an
      ancient and celebrated people in the Roman empire. It was not
      long, perhaps, before the Jews themselves, animated with a
      fiercer zeal and a more jealous faith, perceived the gradual
      separation of their Nazarene brethren from the doctrine of the
      synagogue; and they would gladly have extinguished the dangerous
      heresy in the blood of its adherents. But the decrees of Heaven
      had already disarmed their malice; and though they might
      sometimes exert the licentious privilege of sedition, they no
      longer possessed the administration of criminal justice; nor did
      they find it easy to infuse into the calm breast of a Roman
      magistrate the rancor of their own zeal and prejudice. The
      provincial governors declared themselves ready to listen to any
      accusation that might affect the public safety; but as soon as
      they were informed that it was a question not of facts but of
      words, a dispute relating only to the interpretation of the
      Jewish laws and prophecies, they deemed it unworthy of the
      majesty of Rome seriously to discuss the obscure differences
      which might arise among a barbarous and superstitious people. The
      innocence of the first Christians was protected by ignorance and
      contempt; and the tribunal of the Pagan magistrate often proved
      their most assured refuge against the fury of the synagogue. 26
      If indeed we were disposed to adopt the traditions of a too
      credulous antiquity, we might relate the distant peregrinations,
      the wonderful achievements, and the various deaths of the twelve
      apostles: but a more accurate inquiry will induce us to doubt,
      whether any of those persons who had been witnesses to the
      miracles of Christ were permitted, beyond the limits of
      Palestine, to seal with their blood the truth of their testimony.
      27 From the ordinary term of human life, it may very naturally be
      presumed that most of them were deceased before the discontent of
      the Jews broke out into that furious war, which was terminated
      only by the ruin of Jerusalem. During a long period, from the
      death of Christ to that memorable rebellion, we cannot discover
      any traces of Roman intolerance, unless they are to be found in
      the sudden, the transient, but the cruel persecution, which was
      exercised by Nero against the Christians of the capital,
      thirty-five years after the former, and only two years before the
      latter, of those great events. The character of the philosophic
      historian, to whom we are principally indebted for the knowledge
      of this singular transaction, would alone be sufficient to
      recommend it to our most attentive consideration.

      27 (return) [ In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of
      Alexandria, the glory of martyrdom was confined to St. Peter, St.
      Paul, and St. James. It was gradually bestowed on the rest of the
      apostles, by the more recent Greeks, who prudently selected for
      the theatre of their preaching and sufferings some remote country
      beyond the limits of the Roman empire. See Mosheim, p. 81; and
      Tillemont, Mémoires Ecclésiastiques, tom. i. part iii.]

      In the tenth year of the reign of Nero, the capital of the empire
      was afflicted by a fire which raged beyond the memory or example
      of former ages. 28 The monuments of Grecian art and of Roman
      virtue, the trophies of the Punic and Gallic wars, the most holy
      temples, and the most splendid palaces, were involved in one
      common destruction. Of the fourteen regions or quarters into
      which Rome was divided, four only subsisted entire, three were
      levelled with the ground, and the remaining seven, which had
      experienced the fury of the flames, displayed a melancholy
      prospect of ruin and desolation. The vigilance of government
      appears not to have neglected any of the precautions which might
      alleviate the sense of so dreadful a calamity. The Imperial
      gardens were thrown open to the distressed multitude, temporary
      buildings were erected for their accommodation, and a plentiful
      supply of corn and provisions was distributed at a very moderate
      price. 29 The most generous policy seemed to have dictated the
      edicts which regulated the disposition of the streets and the
      construction of private houses; and as it usually happens, in an
      age of prosperity, the conflagration of Rome, in the course of a
      few years, produced a new city, more regular and more beautiful
      than the former. But all the prudence and humanity affected by
      Nero on this occasion were insufficient to preserve him from the
      popular suspicion. Every crime might be imputed to the assassin
      of his wife and mother; nor could the prince who prostituted his
      person and dignity on the theatre be deemed incapable of the most
      extravagant folly. The voice of rumor accused the emperor as the
      incendiary of his own capital; and as the most incredible stories
      are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people, it was
      gravely reported, and firmly believed, that Nero, enjoying the
      calamity which he had occasioned, amused himself with singing to
      his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy. 30 To divert a
      suspicion, which the power of despotism was unable to suppress,
      the emperor resolved to substitute in his own place some
      fictitious criminals. “With this view,” continues Tacitus, “he
      inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men, who, under
      the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded with
      deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ,
      who in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence
      of the procurator Pontius Pilate. 31 For a while this dire
      superstition was checked; but it again burst forth; 3111 and not
      only spread itself over Judæa, the first seat of this mischievous
      sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which
      receives and protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious.
      The confessions of those who were seized discovered a great
      multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not
      so much for the crime of setting fire to the city, as for their
      hatred of human kind. 32 They died in torments, and their
      torments were imbittered by insult and derision. Some were nailed
      on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and
      exposed to the fury of dogs; others again, smeared over with
      combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the
      darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the
      melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse-race and
      honored with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the
      populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of
      the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishment, but
      the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the
      opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much
      to the public welfare, as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant.” 33
      Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind,
      may observe, that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican,
      which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians, have
      been rendered still more famous by the triumph and by the abuse
      of the persecuted religion. On the same spot, 34 a temple, which
      far surpasses the ancient glories of the Capitol, has been since
      erected by the Christian Pontiffs, who, deriving their claim of
      universal dominion from an humble fisherman of Galilee, have
      succeeded to the throne of the Cæsars, given laws to the
      barbarian conquerors of Rome, and extended their spiritual
      jurisdiction from the coast of the Baltic to the shores of the
      Pacific Ocean.

      But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero’s
      persecution, till we have made some observations that may serve
      to remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed, and to
      throw some light on the subsequent history of the church.

      1. The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth
      of this extraordinary fact, and the integrity of this celebrated
      passage of Tacitus. The former is confirmed by the diligent and
      accurate Suetonius, who mentions the punishment which Nero
      inflicted on the Christians, a sect of men who had embraced a new
      and criminal superstition. 35 The latter may be proved by the
      consent of the most ancient manuscripts; by the inimitable
      character of the style of Tacitus by his reputation, which
      guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud; and by
      the purport of his narration, which accused the first Christians
      of the most atrocious crimes, without insinuating that they
      possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of
      mankind. 36 2. Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was
      born some years before the fire of Rome, 37 he could derive only
      from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which
      happened during his infancy. Before he gave himself to the
      public, he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full
      maturity, and he was more than forty years of age, when a
      grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted
      from him the most early of those historical compositions which
      will delight and instruct the most distant posterity. After
      making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the
      description of Germany, he conceived, and at length executed, a
      more arduous work; the history of Rome, in thirty books, from the
      fall of Nero to the accession of Nerva. The administration of
      Nerva introduced an age of justice and propriety, which Tacitus
      had destined for the occupation of his old age; 38 but when he
      took a nearer view of his subject, judging, perhaps, that it was
      a more honorable or a less invidious office to record the vices
      of past tyrants, than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning
      monarch, he chose rather to relate, under the form of annals, the
      actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus. To collect,
      to dispose, and to adorn a series of fourscore years, in an
      immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant with the
      deepest observations and the most lively images, was an
      undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself
      during the greatest part of his life. In the last years of the
      reign of Trajan, whilst the victorious monarch extended the power
      of Rome beyond its ancient limits, the historian was describing,
      in the second and fourth books of his annals, the tyranny of
      Tiberius; 39 and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the
      throne, before Tacitus, in the regular prosecution of his work,
      could relate the fire of the capital, and the cruelty of Nero
      towards the unfortunate Christians. At the distance of sixty
      years, it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of
      contemporaries; but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge
      himself in the description of the origin, the progress, and the
      character of the new sect, not so much according to the knowledge
      or prejudices of the age of Nero, as according to those of the
      time of Hadrian. 3 Tacitus very frequently trusts to the
      curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those
      intermediate circumstances and ideas, which, in his extreme
      conciseness, he has thought proper to suppress. We may therefore
      presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the
      cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome, whose obscurity,
      as well as innocence, should have shielded them from his
      indignation, and even from his notice. The Jews, who were
      numerous in the capital, and oppressed in their own country, were
      a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the
      people: nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation, who
      already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke, might have
      recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their
      implacable revenge. But the Jews possessed very powerful
      advocates in the palace, and even in the heart of the tyrant; his
      wife and mistress, the beautiful Poppæa, and a favorite player of
      the race of Abraham, who had already employed their intercession
      in behalf of the obnoxious people. 40 In their room it was
      necessary to offer some other victims, and it might easily be
      suggested that, although the genuine followers of Moses were
      innocent of the fire of Rome, there had arisen among them a new
      and pernicious sect of Galilæans, which was capable of the most
      horrid crimes. Under the appellation of Galilæans, two
      distinctions of men were confounded, the most opposite to each
      other in their manners and principles; the disciples who had
      embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth, 41 and the zealots who
      had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite. 42 The former
      were the friends, the latter were the enemies, of human kind; and
      the only resemblance between them consisted in the same
      inflexible constancy, which, in the defence of their cause,
      rendered them insensible of death and tortures. The followers of
      Judas, who impelled their countrymen into rebellion, were soon
      buried under the ruins of Jerusalem; whilst those of Jesus, known
      by the more celebrated name of Christians, diffused themselves
      over the Roman empire. How natural was it for Tacitus, in the
      time of Hadrian, to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and
      the sufferings, 4211 which he might, with far greater truth and
      justice, have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost
      extinguished! 4. Whatever opinion may be entertained of this
      conjecture, (for it is no more than a conjecture,) it is evident
      that the effect, as well as the cause, of Nero’s persecution, was
      confined to the walls of Rome, 43 that the religious tenets of
      the Galilæans or Christians, 431 were never made a subject of
      punishment, or even of inquiry; and that, as the idea of their
      sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of cruelty
      and injustice, the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them
      to spare a sect, oppressed by a tyrant, whose rage had been
      usually directed against virtue and innocence.

      pursued his travels during this period, affords at least a strong

      Christians in other parts of the empire.—M.]

      It is somewhat remarkable that the flames of war consumed, almost
      at the same time, the temple of Jerusalem and the Capitol of
      Rome; 44 and it appears no less singular, that the tribute which
      devotion had destined to the former, should have been converted
      by the power of an assaulting victor to restore and adorn the
      splendor of the latter. 45 The emperors levied a general
      capitation tax on the Jewish people; and although the sum
      assessed on the head of each individual was inconsiderable, the
      use for which it was designed, and the severity with which it was
      exacted, were considered as an intolerable grievance. 46 Since
      the officers of the revenue extended their unjust claim to many
      persons who were strangers to the blood or religion of the Jews,
      it was impossible that the Christians, who had so often sheltered
      themselves under the shade of the synagogue, should now escape
      this rapacious persecution. Anxious as they were to avoid the
      slightest infection of idolatry, their conscience forbade them to
      contribute to the honor of that dæmon who had assumed the
      character of the Capitoline Jupiter. As a very numerous though
      declining party among the Christians still adhered to the law of
      Moses, their efforts to dissemble their Jewish origin were
      detected by the decisive test of circumcision; 47 nor were the
      Roman magistrates at leisure to inquire into the difference of
      their religious tenets. Among the Christians who were brought
      before the tribunal of the emperor, or, as it seems more
      probable, before that of the procurator of Judæa, two persons are
      said to have appeared, distinguished by their extraction, which
      was more truly noble than that of the greatest monarchs. These
      were the grandsons of St. Jude the apostle, who himself was the
      brother of Jesus Christ. 48 Their natural pretensions to the
      throne of David might perhaps attract the respect of the people,
      and excite the jealousy of the governor; but the meanness of
      their garb, and the simplicity of their answers, soon convinced
      him that they were neither desirous nor capable of disturbing the
      peace of the Roman empire. They frankly confessed their royal
      origin, and their near relation to the Messiah; but they
      disclaimed any temporal views, and professed that his kingdom,
      which they devoutly expected, was purely of a spiritual and
      angelic nature. When they were examined concerning their fortune
      and occupation, they showed their hands, hardened with daily
      labor, and declared that they derived their whole subsistence
      from the cultivation of a farm near the village of Cocaba, of the
      extent of about twenty-four English acres, 49 and of the value of
      nine thousand drachms, or three hundred pounds sterling. The

      for the virginity of the mother of God suggested to the Gnostics,
      and afterwards to the orthodox Greeks, the expedient of bestowing
      a second wife on Joseph. The Latins (from the time of Jerome)
      improved on that hint, asserted the perpetual celibacy of Joseph,
      and justified by many similar examples the new interpretation
      that Jude, as well as Simon and James, who were styled the
      brothers of Jesus Christ, were only his first cousins. See

      But although the obscurity of the house of David might protect
      them from the suspicions of a tyrant, the present greatness of
      his own family alarmed the pusillanimous temper of Domitian,
      which could only be appeased by the blood of those Romans whom he
      either feared, or hated, or esteemed. Of the two sons of his
      uncle Flavius Sabinus, 51 the elder was soon convicted of
      treasonable intentions, and the younger, who bore the name of
      Flavius Clemens, was indebted for his safety to his want of
      courage and ability. 52 The emperor for a long time,
      distinguished so harmless a kinsman by his favor and protection,
      bestowed on him his own niece Domitilla, adopted the children of
      that marriage to the hope of the succession, and invested their
      father with the honors of the consulship.

      But he had scarcely finished the term of his annual magistracy,
      when, on a slight pretence, he was condemned and executed;
      Domitilla was banished to a desolate island on the coast of
      Campania; 53 and sentences either of death or of confiscation
      were pronounced against a great number of who were involved in
      the same accusation. The guilt imputed to their charge was that
      of _Atheism_ and _Jewish manners;_ 54 a singular association of
      ideas, which cannot with any propriety be applied except to the
      Christians, as they were obscurely and imperfectly viewed by the
      magistrates and by the writers of that period. On the strength of
      so probable an interpretation, and too eagerly admitting the
      suspicions of a tyrant as an evidence of their honorable crime,
      the church has placed both Clemens and Domitilla among its first
      martyrs, and has branded the cruelty of Domitian with the name of
      the second persecution. But this persecution (if it deserves that
      epithet) was of no long duration. A few months after the death of
      Clemens, and the banishment of Domitilla, Stephen, a freedman
      belonging to the latter, who had enjoyed the favor, but who had
      not surely embraced the faith, of his mistress, 5411 assassinated
      the emperor in his palace. 55 The memory of Domitian was
      condemned by the senate; his acts were rescinded; his exiles
      recalled; and under the gentle administration of Nerva, while the
      innocent were restored to their rank and fortunes, even the most
      guilty either obtained pardon or escaped punishment. 56

      II. About ten years afterwards, under the reign of Trajan, the
      younger Pliny was intrusted by his friend and master with the
      government of Bithynia and Pontus. He soon found himself at a
      loss to determine by what rule of justice or of law he should
      direct his conduct in the execution of an office the most
      repugnant to his humanity. Pliny had never assisted at any
      judicial proceedings against the Christians, with whose name
      alone he seems to be acquainted; and he was totally uninformed
      with regard to the nature of their guilt, the method of their
      conviction, and the degree of their punishment. In this
      perplexity he had recourse to his usual expedient, of submitting
      to the wisdom of Trajan an impartial, and, in some respects, a
      favorable account of the new superstition, requesting the
      emperor, that he would condescend to resolve his doubts, and to
      instruct his ignorance. 57 The life of Pliny had been employed in
      the acquisition of learning, and in the business of the world.

      Since the age of nineteen he had pleaded with distinction in the
      tribunals of Rome, 58 filled a place in the senate, had been
      invested with the honors of the consulship, and had formed very
      numerous connections with every order of men, both in Italy and
      in the provinces. From _his_ ignorance therefore we may derive
      some useful information. We may assure ourselves, that when he
      accepted the government of Bithynia, there were no general laws
      or decrees of the senate in force against the Christians; that
      neither Trajan nor any of his virtuous predecessors, whose edicts
      were received into the civil and criminal jurisprudence, had
      publicly declared their intentions concerning the new sect; and
      that whatever proceedings had been carried on against the
      Christians, there were none of sufficient weight and authority to
      establish a precedent for the conduct of a Roman magistrate.

      The answer of Trajan, to which the Christians of the succeeding
      age have frequently appealed, discovers as much regard for
      justice and humanity as could be reconciled with his mistaken
      notions of religious policy. 59 Instead of displaying the
      implacable zeal of an inquisitor, anxious to discover the most
      minute particles of heresy, and exulting in the number of his
      victims, the emperor expresses much more solicitude to protect
      the security of the innocent, than to prevent the escape of the
      guilty. He acknowledged the difficulty of fixing any general
      plan; but he lays down two salutary rules, which often afforded
      relief and support to the distressed Christians. Though he
      directs the magistrates to punish such persons as are legally
      convicted, he prohibits them, with a very humane inconsistency,
      from making any inquiries concerning the supposed criminals. Nor
      was the magistrate allowed to proceed on every kind of
      information. Anonymous charges the emperor rejects, as too
      repugnant to the equity of his government; and he strictly
      requires, for the conviction of those to whom the guilt of
      Christianity is imputed, the positive evidence of a fair and open
      accuser. It is likewise probable, that the persons who assumed so
      invidiuous an office, were obliged to declare the grounds of
      their suspicions, to specify (both in respect to time and place)
      the secret assemblies, which their Christian adversary had
      frequented, and to disclose a great number of circumstances,
      which were concealed with the most vigilant jealousy from the eye
      of the profane. If they succeeded in their prosecution, they were
      exposed to the resentment of a considerable and active party, to
      the censure of the more liberal portion of mankind, and to the
      ignominy which, in every age and country, has attended the
      character of an informer. If, on the contrary, they failed in
      their proofs, they incurred the severe and perhaps capital
      penalty, which, according to a law published by the emperor
      Hadrian, was inflicted on those who falsely attributed to their
      fellow-citizens the crime of Christianity. The violence of
      personal or superstitious animosity might sometimes prevail over
      the most natural apprehensions of disgrace and danger but it
      cannot surely be imagined, 60 that accusations of so unpromising
      an appearance were either lightly or frequently undertaken by the
      Pagan subjects of the Roman empire. 6011

      The expedient which was employed to elude the prudence of the
      laws, affords a sufficient proof how effectually they
      disappointed the mischievous designs of private malice or
      superstitious zeal. In a large and tumultuous assembly, the
      restraints of fear and shame, so forcible on the minds of
      individuals, are deprived of the greatest part of their
      influence. The pious Christian, as he was desirous to obtain, or
      to escape, the glory of martyrdom, expected, either with
      impatience or with terror, the stated returns of the public games
      and festivals. On those occasions the inhabitants of the great
      cities of the empire were collected in the circus or the theatre,
      where every circumstance of the place, as well as of the
      ceremony, contributed to kindle their devotion, and to extinguish
      their humanity. Whilst the numerous spectators, crowned with
      garlands, perfumed with incense, purified with the blood of
      victims, and surrounded with the altars and statues of their
      tutelar deities, resigned themselves to the enjoyment of
      pleasures, which they considered as an essential part of their
      religious worship, they recollected, that the Christians alone
      abhorred the gods of mankind, and by their absence and melancholy
      on these solemn festivals, seemed to insult or to lament the
      public felicity. If the empire had been afflicted by any recent
      calamity, by a plague, a famine, or an unsuccessful war; if the
      Tyber had, or if the Nile had not, risen beyond its banks; if the
      earth had shaken, or if the temperate order of the seasons had
      been interrupted, the superstitious Pagans were convinced that
      the crimes and the impiety of the Christians, who were spared by
      the excessive lenity of the government, had at length provoked
      the divine justice. It was not among a licentious and exasperated
      populace, that the forms of legal proceedings could be observed;
      it was not in an amphitheatre, stained with the blood of wild
      beasts and gladiators, that the voice of compassion could be
      heard. The impatient clamors of the multitude denounced the
      Christians as the enemies of gods and men, doomed them to the
      severest tortures, and venturing to accuse by name some of the
      most distinguished of the new sectaries, required with
      irresistible vehemence that they should be instantly apprehended
      and cast to the lions. 61 The provincial governors and
      magistrates who presided in the public spectacles were usually
      inclined to gratify the inclinations, and to appease the rage, of
      the people, by the sacrifice of a few obnoxious victims. But the
      wisdom of the emperors protected the church from the danger of
      these tumultuous clamors and irregular accusations, which they
      justly censured as repugnant both to the firmness and to the
      equity of their administration. The edicts of Hadrian and of
      Antoninus Pius expressly declared, that the voice of the
      multitude should never be admitted as legal evidence to convict
      or to punish those unfortunate persons who had embraced the
      enthusiasm of the Christians. 62

      61 (return) [ See Tertullian, (Apolog. c. 40.) The acts of the
      martyrdom of Polycarp exhibit a lively picture of these tumults,

      62 (return) [ These regulations are inserted in the above

      III. Punishment was not the inevitable consequence of conviction,
      and the Christians, whose guilt was the most clearly proved by
      the testimony of witnesses, or even by their voluntary
      confession, still retained in their own power the alternative of
      life or death. It was not so much the past offence, as the actual
      resistance, which excited the indignation of the magistrate. He
      was persuaded that he offered them an easy pardon, since, if they
      consented to cast a few grains of incense upon the altar, they
      were dismissed from the tribunal in safety and with applause. It
      was esteemed the duty of a humane judge to endeavor to reclaim,
      rather than to punish, those deluded enthusiasts. Varying his
      tone according to the age, the sex, or the situation of the
      prisoners, he frequently condescended to set before their eyes
      every circumstance which could render life more pleasing, or
      death more terrible; and to solicit, nay, to entreat, them, that
      they would show some compassion to themselves, to their families,
      and to their friends. 63 If threats and persuasions proved
      ineffectual, he had often recourse to violence; the scourge and
      the rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument, and
      every art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and,
      as it appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The
      ancient apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal
      truth and severity, the irregular conduct of their persecutors
      who, contrary to every principle of judicial proceeding, admitted
      the use of torture, in order to obtain, not a confession, but a
      denial, of the crime which was the object of their inquiry. 64
      The monks of succeeding ages, who, in their peaceful solitudes,
      entertained themselves with diversifying the deaths and
      sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have frequently invented
      torments of a much more refined and ingenious nature. In
      particular, it has pleased them to suppose, that the zeal of the
      Roman magistrates, disdaining every consideration of moral virtue
      or public decency, endeavored to seduce those whom they were
      unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal
      violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to
      seduce. It is related, that females, who were prepared to despise
      death, were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, 6411 and
      called upon to determine whether they set a higher value on their
      religion or on their chastity. The youths to whose licentious
      embraces they were abandoned, received a solemn exhortation from
      the judge, to exert their most strenuous efforts to maintain the
      honor of Venus against the impious virgin who refused to burn
      incense on her altars. Their violence, however, was commonly
      disappointed, and the seasonable interposition of some miraculous
      power preserved the chaste spouses of Christ from the dishonor
      even of an involuntary defeat. We should not indeed neglect to
      remark, that the more ancient as well as authentic memorials of
      the church are seldom polluted with these extravagant and
      indecent fictions. 65

      63 (return) [ See the rescript of Trajan, and the conduct of

      apologists had been a lawyer, and the other a rhetorician.]

      to brothels, have lost their life rather than defile their
      virtue.” Euseb. Hist. Ecc. viii. 14.—G. The miraculous

      the monks.—M.]

      Acta Sincere Martyrum, published by Ruinart, p. 160, 399. Jerome,

      young man, who was chained naked on a bed of flowers, and
      assaulted by a beautiful and wanton courtesan. He quelled the
      rising temptation by biting off his tongue.]

      The total disregard of truth and probability in the
      representation of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a
      very natural mistake. The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or
      fifth centuries ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the same
      degree of implacable and unrelenting zeal which filled their own
      breasts against the heretics or the idolaters of their own times.

      It is not improbable that some of those persons who were raised
      to the dignities of the empire, might have imbibed the prejudices
      of the populace, and that the cruel disposition of others might
      occasionally be stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal
      resentment. 66 But it is certain, and we may appeal to the
      grateful confessions of the first Christians, that the greatest
      part of those magistrates who exercised in the provinces the
      authority of the emperor, or of the senate, and to whose hands
      alone the jurisdiction of life and death was intrusted, behaved
      like men of polished manners and liberal education, who respected
      the rules of justice, and who were conversant with the precepts
      of philosophy. They frequently declined the odious task of
      persecution, dismissed the charge with contempt, or suggested to
      the accused Christian some legal evasion, by which he might elude
      the severity of the laws. 67 Whenever they were invested with a
      discretionary power, 68 they used it much less for the
      oppression, than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted
      church. They were far from condemning all the Christians who were
      accused before their tribunal, and very far from punishing with
      death all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to
      the new superstition. Contenting themselves, for the most part,
      with the milder chastisements of imprisonment, exile, or slavery
      in the mines, 69 they left the unhappy victims of their justice
      some reason to hope, that a prosperous event, the accession, the
      marriage, or the triumph of an emperor, might speedily restore
      them, by a general pardon, to their former state. The martyrs,
      devoted to immediate execution by the Roman magistrates, appear
      to have been selected from the most opposite extremes. They were
      either bishops and presbyters, the persons the most distinguished
      among the Christians by their rank and influence, and whose
      example might strike terror into the whole sect; 70 or else they
      were the meanest and most abject among them, particularly those
      of the servile condition, whose lives were esteemed of little
      value, and whose sufferings were viewed by the ancients with too
      careless an indifference. 71 The learned Origen, who, from his
      experience as well as reading, was intimately acquainted with the
      history of the Christians, declares, in the most express terms,
      that the number of martyrs was very inconsiderable. 72 His
      authority would alone be sufficient to annihilate that formidable
      army of martyrs, whose relics, drawn for the most part from the
      catacombs of Rome, have replenished so many churches, 73 and
      whose marvellous achievements have been the subject of so many
      volumes of Holy Romance. 74 But the general assertion of Origen
      may be explained and confirmed by the particular testimony of his
      friend Dionysius, who, in the immense city of Alexandria, and
      under the rigorous persecution of Decius, reckons only ten men
      and seven women who suffered for the profession of the Christian
      name. 75

      sent in chains to Rome as a public spectacle, and when he arrived
      at Troas, he received the pleasing intelligence, that the
      persecution of Antioch was already at an end. * Note: The acts of
      Ignatius are generally received as authentic, as are seven of his
      letters. Eusebius and St. Jerome mention them: there are two
      editions; in one, the letters are longer, and many passages
      appear to have been interpolated; the other edition is that which
      contains the real letters of St. Ignatius; such at least is the
      opinion of the wisest and most enlightened critics. (See Lardner.

      according to some; of 116, according to others.—G.]

      the number put to death inconsiderable only when compared to the
      numbers who had survived. Besides this, he is speaking of the
      state of the religion under Caracalla, Elagabalus, Alexander

      the letters B.M., a vial full of red liquor supposed to be blood,
      or the figure of a palm-tree. But the two former signs are of
      little weight, and with regard to the last, it is observed by the
      critics, 1. That the figure, as it is called, of a palm, is
      perhaps a cypress, and perhaps only a stop, the flourish of a
      comma used in the monumental inscriptions. 2. That the palm was
      the symbol of victory among the Pagans. 3. That among the
      Christians it served as the emblem, not only of martyrdom, but in
      general of a joyful resurrection. See the epistle of P. Mabillon,

      75 (return) [ Dionysius ap. Euseb l. vi. c. 41 One of the

      to have said, was falsely accused of robbery, for so it is in the
      Greek text. This Christian, named Nemesion, falsely accused of
      robbery before the centurion, was acquitted of a crime altogether
      foreign to his character, but he was led before the governor as
      guilty of being a Christian, and the governor inflicted upon him
      a double torture. (Euseb. loc. cit.) It must be added, that Saint
      Dionysius only makes particular mention of the principal martyrs,
      [this is very doubtful.—M.] and that he says, in general, that
      the fury of the Pagans against the Christians gave to Alexandria
      the appearance of a city taken by storm. [This refers to plunder
      and ill usage, not to actual slaughter.—M.] Finally it should be
      observed that Origen wrote before the persecution of the emperor
      Decius.—G.]

      During the same period of persecution, the zealous, the eloquent,
      the ambitious Cyprian governed the church, not only of Carthage,
      but even of Africa. He possessed every quality which could engage
      the reverence of the faithful, or provoke the suspicions and
      resentment of the Pagan magistrates. His character as well as his
      station seemed to mark out that holy prelate as the most
      distinguished object of envy and danger. 76 The experience,
      however, of the life of Cyprian, is sufficient to prove that our
      fancy has exaggerated the perilous situation of a Christian
      bishop; and the dangers to which he was exposed were less
      imminent than those which temporal ambition is always prepared to
      encounter in the pursuit of honors. Four Roman emperors, with
      their families, their favorites, and their adherents, perished by
      the sword in the space of ten years, during which the bishop of
      Carthage guided by his authority and eloquence the councils of
      the African church. It was only in the third year of his
      administration, that he had reason, during a few months, to
      apprehend the severe edicts of Decius, the vigilance of the
      magistrate and the clamors of the multitude, who loudly demanded,
      that Cyprian, the leader of the Christians, should be thrown to
      the lions. Prudence suggested the necessity of a temporary
      retreat, and the voice of prudence was obeyed. He withdrew
      himself into an obscure solitude, from whence he could maintain a
      constant correspondence with the clergy and people of Carthage;
      and, concealing himself till the tempest was past, he preserved
      his life, without relinquishing either his power or his
      reputation. His extreme caution did not, however, escape the
      censure of the more rigid Christians, who lamented, or the
      reproaches of his personal enemies, who insulted, a conduct which
      they considered as a pusillanimous and criminal desertion of the
      most sacred duty. 77 The propriety of reserving himself for the
      future exigencies of the church, the example of several holy
      bishops, 78 and the divine admonitions, which, as he declares
      himself, he frequently received in visions and ecstacies, were
      the reasons alleged in his justification. 79 But his best apology
      may be found in the cheerful resolution, with which, about eight
      years afterwards, he suffered death in the cause of religion. The
      authentic history of his martyrdom has been recorded with unusual
      candor and impartiality. A short abstract, therefore, of its most
      important circumstances, will convey the clearest information of
      the spirit, and of the forms, of the Roman persecutions. 80

      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part IV.


      When Valerian was consul for the third, and Gallienus for the
      fourth time, Paternus, proconsul of Africa, summoned Cyprian to
      appear in his private council-chamber. He there acquainted him
      with the Imperial mandate which he had just received, 81 that
      those who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately
      return to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors.
      Cyprian replied without hesitation, that he was a Christian and a
      bishop, devoted to the worship of the true and only Deity, to
      whom he offered up his daily supplications for the safety and
      prosperity of the two emperors, his lawful sovereigns.

      With modest confidence he pleaded the privilege of a citizen, in
      refusing to give any answer to some invidious and indeed illegal
      questions which the proconsul had proposed. A sentence of
      banishment was pronounced as the penalty of Cyprian’s
      disobedience; and he was conducted without delay to Curubis, a
      free and maritime city of Zeugitania, in a pleasant situation, a
      fertile territory, and at the distance of about forty miles from
      Carthage. 82 The exiled bishop enjoyed the conveniences of life
      and the consciousness of virtue. His reputation was diffused over
      Africa and Italy; an account of his behavior was published for
      the edification of the Christian world; 83 and his solitude was
      frequently interrupted by the letters, the visits, and the
      congratulations of the faithful. On the arrival of a new
      proconsul in the province the fortune of Cyprian appeared for
      some time to wear a still more favorable aspect. He was recalled
      from banishment; and though not yet permitted to return to
      Carthage, his own gardens in the neighborhood of the capital were
      assigned for the place of his residence. 84

      81 (return) [ It should seem that these were circular orders,
      sent at the same time to all the governors. Dionysius (ap. Euseb.
      l. vii. c. 11) relates the history of his own banishment from
      Alexandria almost in the same manner. But as he escaped and
      survived the persecution, we must account him either more or less
      fortunate than Cyprian.]

      There are the remains of an aqueduct near Curubis, or Curbis, at
      present altered into Gurbes; and Dr. Shaw read an inscription,
      which styles that city _Colonia Fulvia_. The deacon Pontius (in
      Vit. Cyprian. c. 12) calls it “Apricum et competentem locum,
      hospitium pro voluntate secretum, et quicquid apponi eis ante
      promissum est, qui regnum et justitiam Dei quærunt.”]

      84 (return) [ Upon his conversion, he had sold those gardens for
      the benefit of the poor. The indulgence of God (most probably the
      liberality of some Christian friend) restored them to Cyprian.
      See Pontius, c. 15.]

      At length, exactly one year 85 after Cyprian was first
      apprehended, Galerius Maximus, proconsul of Africa, received the
      Imperial warrant for the execution of the Christian teachers. The
      bishop of Carthage was sensible that he should be singled out for
      one of the first victims; and the frailty of nature tempted him
      to withdraw himself, by a secret flight, from the danger and the
      honor of martyrdom; 8511 but soon recovering that fortitude which
      his character required, he returned to his gardens, and patiently
      expected the ministers of death. Two officers of rank, who were
      intrusted with that commission, placed Cyprian between them in a
      chariot, and as the proconsul was not then at leisure, they
      conducted him, not to a prison, but to a private house in
      Carthage, which belonged to one of them. An elegant supper was
      provided for the entertainment of the bishop, and his Christian
      friends were permitted for the last time to enjoy his society,
      whilst the streets were filled with a multitude of the faithful,
      anxious and alarmed at the approaching fate of their spiritual
      father. 86 In the morning he appeared before the tribunal of the
      proconsul, who, after informing himself of the name and situation
      of Cyprian, commanded him to offer sacrifice, and pressed him to
      reflect on the consequences of his disobedience. The refusal of
      Cyprian was firm and decisive; and the magistrate, when he had
      taken the opinion of his council, pronounced with some reluctance
      the sentence of death. It was conceived in the following terms:
      “That Thascius Cyprianus should be immediately beheaded, as the
      enemy of the gods of Rome, and as the chief and ringleader of a
      criminal association, which he had seduced into an impious
      resistance against the laws of the most holy emperors, Valerian
      and Gallienus.” 87 The manner of his execution was the mildest
      and least painful that could be inflicted on a person convicted
      of any capital offence; nor was the use of torture admitted to
      obtain from the bishop of Carthage either the recantation of his
      principles or the discovery of his accomplices.

      85 (return) [ When Cyprian; a twelvemonth before, was sent into
      exile, he dreamt that he should be put to death the next day. The
      event made it necessary to explain that word, as signifying a
      year. Pontius, c. 12.]

      8511 (return) [ This was not, as it appears, the motive which
      induced St. Cyprian to conceal himself for a short time; he was
      threatened to be carried to Utica; he preferred remaining at
      Carthage, in order to suffer martyrdom in the midst of his flock,
      and in order that his death might conduce to the edification of
      those whom he had guided during life. Such, at least, is his own
      explanation of his conduct in one of his letters: Cum perlatum ad
      nos fuisset, fratres carissimi, frumentarios esse missos qui me
      Uticam per ducerent, consilioque carissimorum persuasum est, ut
      de hortis interim recederemus, justa interveniente causâ,
      consensi; eo quod congruat episcopum in eâ civitate, in quâ
      Ecclesiæ dominicæ præest, illie. Dominum confiteri et plebem
      universam præpositi præsentis confessione clarificari Ep. 83.—G]

      86 (return) [ Pontius (c. 15) acknowledges that Cyprian, with
      whom he supped, passed the night custodia delicata. The bishop
      exercised a last and very proper act of jurisdiction, by
      directing that the younger females, who watched in the streets,
      should be removed from the dangers and temptations of a nocturnal
      crowd. Act. Preconsularia, c. 2.]

      87 (return) [ See the original sentence in the Acts, c. 4; and in
      Pontius, c. 17 The latter expresses it in a more rhetorical
      manner.]

      As soon as the sentence was proclaimed, a general cry of “We will
      die with him,” arose at once among the listening multitude of
      Christians who waited before the palace gates. The generous
      effusions of their zeal and their affection were neither
      serviceable to Cyprian nor dangerous to themselves. He was led
      away under a guard of tribunes and centurions, without resistance
      and without insult, to the place of his execution, a spacious and
      level plain near the city, which was already filled with great
      numbers of spectators. His faithful presbyters and deacons were
      permitted to accompany their holy bishop. 8711 They assisted him
      in laying aside his upper garment, spread linen on the ground to
      catch the precious relics of his blood, and received his orders
      to bestow five-and-twenty pieces of gold on the executioner. The
      martyr then covered his face with his hands, and at one blow his
      head was separated from his body. His corpse remained during some
      hours exposed to the curiosity of the Gentiles: but in the night
      it was removed, and transported in a triumphal procession, and
      with a splendid illumination, to the burial-place of the
      Christians. The funeral of Cyprian was publicly celebrated
      without receiving any interruption from the Roman magistrates;
      and those among the faithful, who had performed the last offices
      to his person and his memory, were secure from the danger of
      inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable, that of so great a
      multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the
      first who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom.
      88

      8711 (return) [ There is nothing in the life of St. Cyprian, by
      Pontius, nor in the ancient manuscripts, which can make us
      suppose that the presbyters and deacons in their clerical
      character, and known to be such, had the permission to attend
      their holy bishop. Setting aside all religious considerations, it
      is impossible not to be surprised at the kind of complaisance
      with which the historian here insists, in favor of the
      persecutors, on some mitigating circumstances allowed at the
      death of a man whose only crime was maintaining his own opinions
      with frankness and courage.—G.]

      88 (return) [ Pontius, c. 19. M. de Tillemont (Mémoires, tom. iv.
      part i. p. 450, note 50) is not pleased with so positive an
      exclusion of any former martyr of the episcopal rank. * Note: M.
      de. Tillemont, as an honest writer, explains the difficulties
      which he felt about the text of Pontius, and concludes by
      distinctly stating, that without doubt there is some mistake, and
      that Pontius must have meant only Africa Minor or Carthage; for
      St. Cyprian, in his 58th (69th) letter addressed to Pupianus,
      speaks expressly of many bishops his colleagues, qui proscripti
      sunt, vel apprehensi in carcere et catenis fuerunt; aut qui in
      exilium relegati, illustri itinere ed Dominum profecti sunt; aut
      qui quibusdam locis animadversi, cœlestes coronas de Domini
      clarificatione sumpserunt.—G.]

      It was in the choice of Cyprian, either to die a martyr, or to
      live an apostate; but on the choice depended the alternative of
      honor or infamy. Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had
      employed the profession of the Christian faith only as the
      instrument of his avarice or ambition, it was still incumbent on
      him to support the character he had assumed; 89 and if he
      possessed the smallest degree of manly fortitude, rather to
      expose himself to the most cruel tortures, than by a single act
      to exchange the reputation of a whole life, for the abhorrence of
      his Christian brethren, and the contempt of the Gentile world.
      But if the zeal of Cyprian was supported by the sincere
      conviction of the truth of those doctrines which he preached, the
      crown of martyrdom must have appeared to him as an object of
      desire rather than of terror. It is not easy to extract any
      distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declamations of the
      Fathers, or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory and
      happiness which they confidently promised to those who were so
      fortunate as to shed their blood in the cause of religion. 90
      They inculcated with becoming diligence, that the fire of
      martyrdom supplied every defect and expiated every sin; that
      while the souls of ordinary Christians were obliged to pass
      through a slow and painful purification, the triumphant sufferers
      entered into the immediate fruition of eternal bliss, where, in
      the society of the patriarchs, the apostles, and the prophets,
      they reigned with Christ, and acted as his assessors in the
      universal judgment of mankind. The assurance of a lasting
      reputation upon earth, a motive so congenial to the vanity of
      human nature, often served to animate the courage of the martyrs.

      The honors which Rome or Athens bestowed on those citizens who
      had fallen in the cause of their country, were cold and unmeaning
      demonstrations of respect, when compared with the ardent
      gratitude and devotion which the primitive church expressed
      towards the victorious champions of the faith. The annual
      commemoration of their virtues and sufferings was observed as a
      sacred ceremony, and at length terminated in religious worship.
      Among the Christians who had publicly confessed their religious
      principles, those who (as it very frequently happened) had been
      dismissed from the tribunal or the prisons of the Pagan
      magistrates, obtained such honors as were justly due to their
      imperfect martyrdom and their generous resolution. The most pious
      females courted the permission of imprinting kisses on the
      fetters which they had worn, and on the wounds which they had
      received. Their persons were esteemed holy, their decisions were
      admitted with deference, and they too often abused, by their
      spiritual pride and licentious manners, the preëminence which
      their zeal and intrepidity had acquired. 91 Distinctions like
      these, whilst they display the exalted merit, betray the
      inconsiderable number of those who suffered, and of those who
      died, for the profession of Christianity.

      honorable name on confessors. Note: M. Guizot denies that the
      letters of Cyprian, to which he refers, bear out the statement in
      the text. I cannot scruple to admit the accuracy of Gibbon’s
      quotation. To take only the fifth letter, we find this passage:

      ambiguous expression “too often.” Were the epistles arranged in a
      different manner in the edition consulted by M. Guizot?—M.]

      The sober discretion of the present age will more readily censure
      than admire, but can more easily admire than imitate, the fervor
      of the first Christians, who, according to the lively expressions
      of Sulpicius Severus, desired martyrdom with more eagerness than
      his own contemporaries solicited a bishopric. 92 The epistles
      which Ignatius composed as he was carried in chains through the
      cities of Asia, breathe sentiments the most repugnant to the
      ordinary feelings of human nature. He earnestly beseeches the
      Romans, that when he should be exposed in the amphitheatre, they
      would not, by their kind but unseasonable intercession, deprive
      him of the crown of glory; and he declares his resolution to
      provoke and irritate the wild beasts which might be employed as
      the instruments of his death. 93 Some stories are related of the
      courage of martyrs, who actually performed what Ignatius had
      intended; who exasperated the fury of the lions, pressed the
      executioner to hasten his office, cheerfully leaped into the
      fires which were kindled to consume them, and discovered a
      sensation of joy and pleasure in the midst of the most exquisite
      tortures. Several examples have been preserved of a zeal
      impatient of those restraints which the emperors had provided for
      the security of the church. The Christians sometimes supplied by
      their voluntary declaration the want of an accuser, rudely
      disturbed the public service of paganism, 94 and rushing in
      crowds round the tribunal of the magistrates, called upon them to
      pronounce and to inflict the sentence of the law. The behavior of
      the Christians was too remarkable to escape the notice of the
      ancient philosophers; but they seem to have considered it with
      much less admiration than astonishment. Incapable of conceiving
      the motives which sometimes transported the fortitude of
      believers beyond the bounds of prudence or reason, they treated
      such an eagerness to die as the strange result of obstinate
      despair, of stupid insensibility, or of superstitious frenzy. 95
      “Unhappy men!” exclaimed the proconsul Antoninus to the
      Christians of Asia; “unhappy men! if you are thus weary of your
      lives, is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices?”
      96 He was extremely cautious (as it is observed by a learned and
      picus historian) of punishing men who had found no accusers but
      themselves, the Imperial laws not having made any provision for
      so unexpected a case: condemning therefore a few as a warning to
      their brethren, he dismissed the multitude with indignation and
      contempt. 97 Notwithstanding this real or affected disdain, the
      intrepid constancy of the faithful was productive of more
      salutary effects on those minds which nature or grace had
      disposed for the easy reception of religious truth. On these
      melancholy occasions, there were many among the Gentiles who
      pitied, who admired, and who were converted. The generous
      enthusiasm was communicated from the sufferer to the spectators;
      and the blood of martyrs, according to a well-known observation,
      became the seed of the church.

      But although devotion had raised, and eloquence continued to
      inflame, this fever of the mind, it insensibly gave way to the
      more natural hopes and fears of the human heart, to the love of
      life, the apprehension of pain, and the horror of dissolution.
      The more prudent rulers of the church found themselves obliged to
      restrain the indiscreet ardor of their followers, and to distrust
      a constancy which too often abandoned them in the hour of trial.
      98 As the lives of the faithful became less mortified and
      austere, they were every day less ambitious of the honors of
      martyrdom; and the soldiers of Christ, instead of distinguishing
      themselves by voluntary deeds of heroism, frequently deserted
      their post, and fled in confusion before the enemy whom it was
      their duty to resist. There were three methods, however, of
      escaping the flames of persecution, which were not attended with
      an equal degree of guilt: first, indeed, was generally allowed to
      be innocent; the second was of a doubtful, or at least of a
      venial, nature; but the third implied a direct and criminal
      apostasy from the Christian faith.

      I. A modern inquisitor would hear with surprise, that whenever an
      information was given to a Roman magistrate of any person within
      his jurisdiction who had embraced the sect of the Christians, the
      charge was communicated to the party accused, and that a
      convenient time was allowed him to settle his domestic concerns,
      and to prepare an answer to the crime which was imputed to him.
      99 If he entertained any doubt of his own constancy, such a delay
      afforded him the opportunity of preserving his life and honor by
      flight, of withdrawing himself into some obscure retirement or
      some distant province, and of patiently expecting the return of
      peace and security. A measure so consonant to reason was soon
      authorized by the advice and example of the most holy prelates;
      and seems to have been censured by few except by the Montanists,
      who deviated into heresy by their strict and obstinate adherence
      to the rigor of ancient discipline. 100

      II.The provincial governors, whose zeal was less prevalent than
      their avarice, had countenanced the practice of selling
      certificates, (or libels, as they were called,) which attested,
      that the persons therein mentioned had complied with the laws,
      and sacrificed to the Roman deities. By producing these false
      declarations, the opulent and timid Christians were enabled to
      silence the malice of an informer, and to reconcile in some
      measure their safety with their religion.101 A slight penance
      atoned for this profane dissimulation. 1011

      III. In every persecution there were great numbers of unworthy
      Christians who publicly disowned or renounced the faith which
      they had professed; and who confirmed the sincerity of their
      abjuration, by the legal acts of burning incense or of offering
      sacrifices. Some of these apostates had yielded on the first
      menace or exhortation of the magistrate; whilst the patience of
      others had been subdued by the length and repetition of tortures.
      The affrighted countenances of some betrayed their inward
      remorse, while others advanced with confidence and alacrity to
      the altars of the gods. 102 But the disguise which fear had
      imposed, subsisted no longer than the present danger. As soon as
      the severity of the persecution was abated, the doors of the
      churches were assailed by the returning multitude of penitents
      who detested their idolatrous submission, and who solicited with
      equal ardor, but with various success, their readmission into the
      society of Christians. 103 1031

      99 (return) [ In the second apology of Justin, there is a
      particular and very curious instance of this legal delay. The
      same indulgence was granted to accused Christians, in the
      persecution of Decius: and Cyprian (de Lapsis) expressly mentions
      the “Dies negantibus præstitutus.” * Note: The examples drawn by
      the historian from Justin Martyr and Cyprian relate altogether to
      particular cases, and prove nothing as to the general practice
      adopted towards the accused; it is evident, on the contrary, from
      the same apology of St. Justin, that they hardly ever obtained
      delay. “A man named Lucius, himself a Christian, present at an
      unjust sentence passed against a Christian by the judge Urbicus,
      asked him why he thus punished a man who was neither adulterer
      nor robber, nor guilty of any other crime but that of avowing
      himself a Christian.” Urbicus answered only in these words: “Thou
      also hast the appearance of being a Christian.” “Yes, without
      doubt,” replied Lucius. The judge ordered that he should be put
      to death on the instant. A third, who came up, was condemned to
      be beaten with rods. Here, then, are three examples where no
      delay was granted.——[Surely these acts of a single passionate and
      irritated judge prove the general practice as little as those
      quoted by Gibbon.—M.] There exist a multitude of others, such as
      those of Ptolemy, Marcellus, &c. Justin expressly charges the
      judges with ordering the accused to be executed without hearing
      the cause. The words of St. Cyprian are as particular, and simply
      say, that he had appointed a day by which the Christians must
      have renounced their faith; those who had not done it by that
      time were condemned.—G. This confirms the statement in the

      and his assessors present at the council, were alarmed at seeing
      the crowd of Christians; the judges themselves trembled. Lastly,

      IV. Notwithstanding the general rules established for the
      conviction and punishment of the Christians, the fate of those
      sectaries, in an extensive and arbitrary government, must still
      in a great measure, have depended on their own behavior, the
      circumstances of the times, and the temper of their supreme as
      well as subordinate rulers. Zeal might sometimes provoke, and
      prudence might sometimes avert or assuage, the superstitious fury
      of the Pagans. A variety of motives might dispose the provincial
      governors either to enforce or to relax the execution of the
      laws; and of these motives the most forcible was their regard not
      only for the public edicts, but for the secret intentions of the
      emperor, a glance from whose eye was sufficient to kindle or to
      extinguish the flames of persecution. As often as any occasional
      severities were exercised in the different parts of the empire,
      the primitive Christians lamented and perhaps magnified their own
      sufferings; but the celebrated number of _ten_ persecutions has
      been determined by the ecclesiastical writers of the fifth
      century, who possessed a more distinct view of the prosperous or
      adverse fortunes of the church, from the age of Nero to that of
      Diocletian. The ingenious parallels of the _ten_ plagues of
      Egypt, and of the _ten_ horns of the Apocalypse, first suggested
      this calculation to their minds; and in their application of the
      faith of prophecy to the truth of history, they were careful to
      select those reigns which were indeed the most hostile to the
      Christian cause. 104 But these transient persecutions served only
      to revive the zeal and to restore the discipline of the faithful;
      and the moments of extraordinary rigor were compensated by much
      longer intervals of peace and security. The indifference of some
      princes, and the indulgence of others, permitted the Christians
      to enjoy, though not perhaps a legal, yet an actual and public,
      toleration of their religion.

      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part V.


      The apology of Tertullian contains two very ancient, very
      singular, but at the same time very suspicious, instances of
      Imperial clemency; the edicts published by Tiberius, and by
      Marcus Antoninus, and designed not only to protect the innocence
      of the Christians, but even to proclaim those stupendous miracles
      which had attested the truth of their doctrine. The first of
      these examples is attended with some difficulties which might
      perplex a sceptical mind. 105 We are required to believe, _that_
      Pontius Pilate informed the emperor of the unjust sentence of
      death which he had pronounced against an innocent, and, as it
      appeared, a divine, person; and that, without acquiring the
      merit, he exposed himself to the danger of martyrdom; _that_
      Tiberius, who avowed his contempt for all religion, immediately
      conceived the design of placing the Jewish Messiah among the gods
      of Rome; _that_ his servile senate ventured to disobey the
      commands of their master; _that_ Tiberius, instead of resenting
      their refusal, contented himself with protecting the Christians
      from the severity of the laws, many years before such laws were
      enacted, or before the church had assumed any distinct name or
      existence; and lastly, _that_ the memory of this extraordinary
      transaction was preserved in the most public and authentic
      records, which escaped the knowledge of the historians of Greece
      and Rome, and were only visible to the eyes of an African
      Christian, who composed his apology one hundred and sixty years
      after the death of Tiberius. The edict of Marcus Antoninus is
      supposed to have been the effect of his devotion and gratitude
      for the miraculous deliverance which he had obtained in the
      Marcomannic war. The distress of the legions, the seasonable
      tempest of rain and hail, of thunder and of lightning, and the
      dismay and defeat of the barbarians, have been celebrated by the
      eloquence of several Pagan writers. If there were any Christians
      in that army, it was natural that they should ascribe some merit
      to the fervent prayers, which, in the moment of danger, they had
      offered up for their own and the public safety. But we are still
      assured by monuments of brass and marble, by the Imperial medals,
      and by the Antonine column, that neither the prince nor the
      people entertained any sense of this signal obligation, since
      they unanimously attribute their deliverance to the providence of
      Jupiter, and to the interposition of Mercury. 106 During the
      whole course of his reign, Marcus despised the Christians as a
      philosopher, and punished them as a sovereign. 1061

      105 (return) [ The testimony given by Pontius Pilate is first
      mentioned by Justin. The successive improvements which the story
      acquired (as if has passed through the hands of Tertullian,
      Eusebius, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Orosius, Gregory of Tours, and
      the authors of the several editions of the acts of Pilate) are
      very fairly stated by Dom Calmet Dissertat. sur l’Ecriture, tom.

      1061 (return) [ Gibbon, with this phrase, and that below, which
      admits the injustice of Marcus, has dexterously glossed over one
      of the most remarkable facts in the early Christian history, that
      the reign of the wisest and most humane of the heathen emperors
      was the most fatal to the Christians. Most writers have ascribed
      the persecutions under Marcus to the latent bigotry of his
      character; Mosheim, to the influence of the philosophic party;
      but the fact is admitted by all. A late writer (Mr. Waddington,
      Hist. of the Church, p. 47) has not scrupled to assert, that
      “this prince polluted every year of a long reign with innocent
      blood;” but the causes as well as the date of the persecutions
      authorized or permitted by Marcus are equally uncertain. Of the
      Asiatic edict recorded by Melito. the date is unknown, nor is it
      quite clear that it was an Imperial edict. If it was the act
      under which Polycarp suffered, his martyrdom is placed by Ruinart
      in the sixth, by Mosheim in the ninth, year of the reign of
      Marcus. The martyrs of Vienne and Lyons are assigned by Dodwell
      to the seventh, by most writers to the seventeenth. In fact, the
      commencement of the persecutions of the Christians appears to
      synchronize exactly with the period of the breaking out of the
      Marcomannic war, which seems to have alarmed the whole empire,
      and the emperor himself, into a paroxysm of returning piety to
      their gods, of which the Christians were the victims. See Jul,
      Capit. Script. Hist August. p. 181, edit. 1661. It is remarkable
      that Tertullian (Apologet. c. v.) distinctly asserts that Verus
      (M. Aurelius) issued no edicts against the Christians, and almost
      positively exempts him from the charge of persecution.—M. This
      remarkable synchronism, which explains the persecutions under M
      Aurelius, is shown at length in Milman’s History of Christianity,
      book ii. v.—M. 1845.]

      By a singular fatality, the hardships which they had endured
      under the government of a virtuous prince, immediately ceased on
      the accession of a tyrant; and as none except themselves had
      experienced the injustice of Marcus, so they alone were protected
      by the lenity of Commodus. The celebrated Marcia, the most
      favored of his concubines, and who at length contrived the murder
      of her Imperial lover, entertained a singular affection for the
      oppressed church; and though it was impossible that she could
      reconcile the practice of vice with the precepts of the gospel,
      she might hope to atone for the frailties of her sex and
      profession by declaring herself the patroness of the Christians.
      107 Under the gracious protection of Marcia, they passed in
      safety the thirteen years of a cruel tyranny; and when the empire
      was established in the house of Severus, they formed a domestic
      but more honorable connection with the new court. The emperor was
      persuaded, that in a dangerous sickness, he had derived some
      benefit, either spiritual or physical, from the holy oil, with
      which one of his slaves had anointed him. He always treated with
      peculiar distinction several persons of both sexes who had
      embraced the new religion. The nurse as well as the preceptor of
      Caracalla were Christians; 1071 and if that young prince ever
      betrayed a sentiment of humanity, it was occasioned by an
      incident, which, however trifling, bore some relation to the
      cause of Christianity. 108 Under the reign of Severus, the fury
      of the populace was checked; the rigor of ancient laws was for
      some time suspended; and the provincial governors were satisfied
      with receiving an annual present from the churches within their
      jurisdiction, as the price, or as the reward, of their
      moderation. 109 The controversy concerning the precise time of
      the celebration of Easter, armed the bishops of Asia and Italy
      against each other, and was considered as the most important
      business of this period of leisure and tranquillity. 110 Nor was
      the peace of the church interrupted, till the increasing numbers
      of proselytes seem at length to have attracted the attention, and
      to have alienated the mind of Severus. With the design of
      restraining the progress of Christianity, he published an edict,
      which, though it was designed to affect only the new converts,
      could not be carried into strict execution, without exposing to
      danger and punishment the most zealous of their teachers and
      missionaries. In this mitigated persecution we may still discover
      the indulgent spirit of Rome and of Polytheism, which so readily
      admitted every excuse in favor of those who practised the
      religious ceremonies of their fathers. 111

      But the laws which Severus had enacted soon expired with the
      authority of that emperor; and the Christians, after this
      accidental tempest, enjoyed a calm of thirty-eight years. 112
      Till this period they had usually held their assemblies in
      private houses and sequestered places. They were now permitted to
      erect and consecrate convenient edifices for the purpose of
      religious worship; 113 to purchase lands, even at Rome itself,
      for the use of the community; and to conduct the elections of
      their ecclesiastical ministers in so public, but at the same time
      in so exemplary a manner, as to deserve the respectful attention
      of the Gentiles. 114 This long repose of the church was
      accompanied with dignity. The reigns of those princes who derived
      their extraction from the Asiatic provinces, proved the most
      favorable to the Christians; the eminent persons of the sect,
      instead of being reduced to implore the protection of a slave or
      concubine, were admitted into the palace in the honorable
      characters of priests and philosophers; and their mysterious
      doctrines, which were already diffused among the people,
      insensibly attracted the curiosity of their sovereign. When the
      empress Mammæa passed through Antioch, she expressed a desire of
      conversing with the celebrated Origen, the fame of whose piety
      and learning was spread over the East. Origen obeyed so
      flattering an invitation, and though he could not expect to
      succeed in the conversion of an artful and ambitious woman, she
      listened with pleasure to his eloquent exhortations, and
      honorably dismissed him to his retirement in Palestine. 115 The
      sentiments of Mammæa were adopted by her son Alexander, and the
      philosophic devotion of that emperor was marked by a singular but
      injudicious regard for the Christian religion. In his domestic
      chapel he placed the statues of Abraham, of Orpheus, of
      Apollonius, and of Christ, as an honor justly due to those
      respectable sages who had instructed mankind in the various modes
      of addressing their homage to the supreme and universal Deity.
      116 A purer faith, as well as worship, was openly professed and
      practised among his household. Bishops, perhaps for the first
      time, were seen at court; and, after the death of Alexander, when
      the inhuman Maximin discharged his fury on the favorites and
      servants of his unfortunate benefactor, a great number of
      Christians of every rank and of both sexes, were involved in the
      promiscuous massacre, which, on their account, has improperly
      received the name of Persecution. 117 1171

      117 (return) [ Euseb. l. vi. c. 28. It may be presumed that the
      success of the Christians had exasperated the increasing bigotry
      of the Pagans. Dion Cassius, who composed his history under the
      former reign, had most probably intended for the use of his
      master those counsels of persecution, which he ascribes to a
      better age, and to and to the favorite of Augustus. Concerning
      this oration of Mæcenas, or rather of Dion, I may refer to my own
      unbiased opinion, (vol. i. c. 1, note 25,) and to the Abbé de la
      Bleterie (Mémoires de l’Académie, tom. xxiv. p. 303 tom xxv. p.
      432.) * Note: If this be the case, Dion Cassius must have known
      the Christians they must have been the subject of his particular
      attention, since the author supposes that he wished his master to
      profit by these “counsels of persecution.” How are we to
      reconcile this necessary consequence with what Gibbon has said of
      the ignorance of Dion Cassius even of the name of the Christians?
      (c. xvi. n. 24.) (Gibbon speaks of Dion’s _silence_, not of his
      _ignorance_.—M) The supposition in this note is supported by no
      proof; it is probable that Dion Cassius has often designated the
      Christians by the name of Jews. See Dion Cassius, l. lxvii. c 14,
      lxviii. l—G. On this point I should adopt the view of Gibbon
      rather than that of M Guizot.—M]

      1171 (return) [ It is with good reason that this massacre has
      been called a persecution, for it lasted during the whole reign
      of Maximin, as may be seen in Eusebius. (l. vi. c. 28.) Rufinus
      expressly confirms it: Tribus annis a Maximino persecutione
      commota, in quibus finem et persecutionis fecit et vitas Hist. l.
      vi. c. 19.—G.]

      Notwithstanding the cruel disposition of Maximin, the effects of
      his resentment against the Christians were of a very local and
      temporary nature, and the pious Origen, who had been proscribed
      as a devoted victim, was still reserved to convey the truths of
      the gospel to the ear of monarchs. 118 He addressed several
      edifying letters to the emperor Philip, to his wife, and to his
      mother; and as soon as that prince, who was born in the
      neighborhood of Palestine, had usurped the Imperial sceptre, the
      Christians acquired a friend and a protector. The public and even
      partial favor of Philip towards the sectaries of the new
      religion, and his constant reverence for the ministers of the
      church, gave some color to the suspicion, which prevailed in his
      own times, that the emperor himself was become a convert to the
      faith; 119 and afforded some grounds for a fable which was
      afterwards invented, that he had been purified by confession and
      penance from the guilt contracted by the murder of his innocent
      predecessor. 120 The fall of Philip introduced, with the change
      of masters, a new system of government, so oppressive to the
      Christians, that their former condition, ever since the time of
      Domitian, was represented as a state of perfect freedom and
      security, if compared with the rigorous treatment which they
      experienced under the short reign of Decius. 121 The virtues of
      that prince will scarcely allow us to suspect that he was
      actuated by a mean resentment against the favorites of his
      predecessor; and it is more reasonable to believe, that in the
      prosecution of his general design to restore the purity of Roman
      manners, he was desirous of delivering the empire from what he
      condemned as a recent and criminal superstition. The bishops of
      the most considerable cities were removed by exile or death: the
      vigilance of the magistrates prevented the clergy of Rome during
      sixteen months from proceeding to a new election; and it was the
      opinion of the Christians, that the emperor would more patiently
      endure a competitor for the purple, than a bishop in the capital.
      122 Were it possible to suppose that the penetration of Decius
      had discovered pride under the disguise of humility, or that he
      could foresee the temporal dominion which might insensibly arise
      from the claims of spiritual authority, we might be less
      surprised, that he should consider the successors of St. Peter,
      as the most formidable rivals to those of Augustus.

      evidence, that such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian
      bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the court of Rome,
      expresses himself with a becoming diffidence concerning the truth
      of the fact. The epistles of Origen (which were extant in the
      time of Eusebius, see l. vi. c. 36) would most probably decide
      this curious rather than important question.]

      insinuations of a minister addicted to the superstitions of
      Egypt, he adopted the maxims, and imitated the severity, of his
      predecessor Decius. 123 The accession of Gallienus, which
      increased the calamities of the empire, restored peace to the
      church; and the Christians obtained the free exercise of their
      religion by an edict addressed to the bishops, and conceived in
      such terms as seemed to acknowledge their office and public
      character. 124 The ancient laws, without being formally repealed,
      were suffered to sink into oblivion; and (excepting only some

      The story of Paul of Samosata, who filled the metropolitan see of
      Antioch, while the East was in the hands of Odenathus and
      Zenobia, may serve to illustrate the condition and character of
      the times. The wealth of that prelate was a sufficient evidence
      of his guilt, since it was neither derived from the inheritance
      of his fathers, nor acquired by the arts of honest industry. But
      Paul considered the service of the church as a very lucrative
      profession. 126 His ecclesiastical jurisdiction was venal and
      rapacious; he extorted frequent contributions from the most
      opulent of the faithful, and converted to his own use a
      considerable part of the public revenue. By his pride and luxury,
      the Christian religion was rendered odious in the eyes of the
      Gentiles. His council chamber and his throne, the splendor with
      which he appeared in public, the suppliant crowd who solicited
      his attention, the multitude of letters and petitions to which he
      dictated his answers, and the perpetual hurry of business in
      which he was involved, were circumstances much better suited to
      the state of a civil magistrate, 127 than to the humility of a
      primitive bishop. When he harangued his people from the pulpit,
      Paul affected the figurative style and the theatrical gestures of
      an Asiatic sophist, while the cathedral resounded with the
      loudest and most extravagant acclamations in the praise of his
      divine eloquence. Against those who resisted his power, or
      refused to flatter his vanity, the prelate of Antioch was
      arrogant, rigid, and inexorable; but he relaxed the discipline,
      and lavished the treasures of the church on his dependent clergy,
      who were permitted to imitate their master in the gratification
      of every sensual appetite. For Paul indulged himself very freely
      in the pleasures of the table, and he had received into the
      episcopal palace two young and beautiful women as the constant
      companions of his leisure moments. 128

      126 (return) [ Paul was better pleased with the title of
      _Ducenarius_, than with that of bishop. The _Ducenarius_ was an
      Imperial procurator, so called from his salary of two hundred
      _Sestertia_, or 1600_l_. a year. (See Salmatius ad Hist. August.
      p. 124.) Some critics suppose that the bishop of Antioch had
      actually obtained such an office from Zenobia, while others
      consider it only as a figurative expression of his pomp and
      insolence.]

      127 (return) [ Simony was not unknown in those times; and the
      clergy some times bought what they intended to sell. It appears
      that the bishopric of Carthage was purchased by a wealthy matron,
      named Lucilla, for her servant Majorinus. The price was 400
      _Folles_. (Monument. Antiq. ad calcem Optati, p. 263.) Every
      _Follis_ contained 125 pieces of silver, and the whole sum may be
      computed at about 2400_l_.]

      128 (return) [ If we are desirous of extenuating the vices of
      Paul, we must suspect the assembled bishops of the East of
      publishing the most malicious calumnies in circular epistles
      addressed to all the churches of the empire, (ap. Euseb. l. vii.
      c. 30.)]

      Notwithstanding these scandalous vices, if Paul of Samosata had
      preserved the purity of the orthodox faith, his reign over the
      capital of Syria would have ended only with his life; and had a
      seasonable persecution intervened, an effort of courage might
      perhaps have placed him in the rank of saints and martyrs. 1281

      Some nice and subtle errors, which he imprudently adopted and
      obstinately maintained, concerning the doctrine of the Trinity,
      excited the zeal and indignation of the Eastern churches. 129

      From Egypt to the Euxine Sea, the bishops were in arms and in
      motion. Several councils were held, confutations were published,
      excommunications were pronounced, ambiguous explanations were by
      turns accepted and refused, treaties were concluded and violated,
      and at length Paul of Samosata was degraded from his episcopal
      character, by the sentence of seventy or eighty bishops, who
      assembled for that purpose at Antioch, and who, without
      consulting the rights of the clergy or people, appointed a
      successor by their own authority. The manifest irregularity of
      this proceeding increased the numbers of the discontented
      faction; and as Paul, who was no stranger to the arts of courts,
      had insinuated himself into the favor of Zenobia, he maintained
      above four years the possession of the episcopal house and
      office. 1291 The victory of Aurelian changed the face of the
      East, and the two contending parties, who applied to each other
      the epithets of schism and heresy, were either commanded or
      permitted to plead their cause before the tribunal of the
      conqueror. This public and very singular trial affords a
      convincing proof that the existence, the property, the
      privileges, and the internal policy of the Christians, were
      acknowledged, if not by the laws, at least by the magistrates, of
      the empire. As a Pagan and as a soldier, it could scarcely be
      expected that Aurelian should enter into the discussion, whether
      the sentiments of Paul or those of his adversaries were most
      agreeable to the true standard of the orthodox faith. His
      determination, however, was founded on the general principles of
      equity and reason. He considered the bishops of Italy as the most
      impartial and respectable judges among the Christians, and as
      soon as he was informed that they had unanimously approved the
      sentence of the council, he acquiesced in their opinion, and
      immediately gave orders that Paul should be compelled to
      relinquish the temporal possessions belonging to an office, of
      which, in the judgment of his brethren, he had been regularly
      deprived. But while we applaud the justice, we should not
      overlook the policy, of Aurelian, who was desirous of restoring
      and cementing the dependence of the provinces on the capital, by
      every means which could bind the interest or prejudices of any
      part of his subjects. 130

      1281 (return) [ It appears, nevertheless, that the vices and

      to inform them of the change in the faith of Paul, the

      Amidst the frequent revolutions of the empire, the Christians
      still flourished in peace and prosperity; and notwithstanding a
      celebrated æra of martyrs has been deduced from the accession of
      Diocletian, 131 the new system of policy, introduced and
      maintained by the wisdom of that prince, continued, during more
      than eighteen years, to breathe the mildest and most liberal
      spirit of religious toleration. The mind of Diocletian himself
      was less adapted indeed to speculative inquiries, than to the
      active labors of war and government. His prudence rendered him
      averse to any great innovation, and though his temper was not
      very susceptible of zeal or enthusiasm, he always maintained an
      habitual regard for the ancient deities of the empire. But the
      leisure of the two empresses, of his wife Prisca, and of Valeria,
      his daughter, permitted them to listen with more attention and
      respect to the truths of Christianity, which in every age has
      acknowledged its important obligations to female devotion. 132
      The principal eunuchs, Lucian 133 and Dorotheus, Gorgonius and
      Andrew, who attended the person, possessed the favor, and
      governed the household of Diocletian, protected by their powerful
      influence the faith which they had embraced. Their example was
      imitated by many of the most considerable officers of the palace,
      who, in their respective stations, had the care of the Imperial
      ornaments, of the robes, of the furniture, of the jewels, and
      even of the private treasury; and, though it might sometimes be
      incumbent on them to accompany the emperor when he sacrificed in
      the temple, 134 they enjoyed, with their wives, their children,
      and their slaves, the free exercise of the Christian religion.
      Diocletian and his colleagues frequently conferred the most
      important offices on those persons who avowed their abhorrence
      for the worship of the gods, but who had displayed abilities
      proper for the service of the state. The bishops held an
      honorable rank in their respective provinces, and were treated
      with distinction and respect, not only by the people, but by the
      magistrates themselves. Almost in every city, the ancient
      churches were found insufficient to contain the increasing
      multitude of proselytes; and in their place more stately and
      capacious edifices were erected for the public worship of the
      faithful. The corruption of manners and principles, so forcibly
      lamented by Eusebius, 135 may be considered, not only as a
      consequence, but as a proof, of the liberty which the Christians
      enjoyed and abused under the reign of Diocletian. Prosperity had
      relaxed the nerves of discipline. Fraud, envy, and malice
      prevailed in every congregation. The presbyters aspired to the
      episcopal office, which every day became an object more worthy of
      their ambition. The bishops, who contended with each other for
      ecclesiastical preëminence, appeared by their conduct to claim a
      secular and tyrannical power in the church; and the lively faith
      which still distinguished the Christians from the Gentiles, was
      shown much less in their lives, than in their controversial
      writings.

      Notwithstanding this seeming security, an attentive observer
      might discern some symptoms that threatened the church with a
      more violent persecution than any which she had yet endured. The
      zeal and rapid progress of the Christians awakened the
      Polytheists from their supine indifference in the cause of those
      deities, whom custom and education had taught them to revere. The
      mutual provocations of a religious war, which had already
      continued above two hundred years, exasperated the animosity of
      the contending parties. The Pagans were incensed at the rashness
      of a recent and obscure sect, which presumed to accuse their
      countrymen of error, and to devote their ancestors to eternal
      misery. The habits of justifying the popular mythology against
      the invectives of an implacable enemy, produced in their minds
      some sentiments of faith and reverence for a system which they
      had been accustomed to consider with the most careless levity.
      The supernatural powers assumed by the church inspired at the
      same time terror and emulation. The followers of the established
      religion intrenched themselves behind a similar fortification of
      prodigies; invented new modes of sacrifice, of expiation, and of
      initiation; 136 attempted to revive the credit of their expiring
      oracles; 137 and listened with eager credulity to every impostor,
      who flattered their prejudices by a tale of wonders. 138 Both
      parties seemed to acknowledge the truth of those miracles which
      were claimed by their adversaries; and while they were contented
      with ascribing them to the arts of magic, and to the power of
      dæmons, they mutually concurred in restoring and establishing the
      reign of superstition. 139 Philosophy, her most dangerous enemy,
      was now converted into her most useful ally. The groves of the
      academy, the gardens of Epicurus, and even the portico of the
      Stoics, were almost deserted, as so many different schools of
      scepticism or impiety; 140 and many among the Romans were
      desirous that the writings of Cicero should be condemned and
      suppressed by the authority of the senate. 141 The prevailing
      sect of the new Platonicians judged it prudent to connect
      themselves with the priests, whom perhaps they despised, against
      the Christians, whom they had reason to fear. These fashionable
      Philosophers prosecuted the design of extracting allegorical
      wisdom from the fictions of the Greek poets; instituted
      mysterious rites of devotion for the use of their chosen
      disciples; recommended the worship of the ancient gods as the
      emblems or ministers of the Supreme Deity, and composed against
      the faith of the gospel many elaborate treatises, 142 which have
      since been committed to the flames by the prudence of orthodox
      emperors. 143

      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part VI.


      Although the policy of Diocletian and the humanity of Constantius
      inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims of toleration, it
      was soon discovered that their two associates, Maximian and
      Galerius, entertained the most implacable aversion for the name
      and religion of the Christians. The minds of those princes had
      never been enlightened by science; education had never softened
      their temper. They owed their greatness to their swords, and in
      their most elevated fortune they still retained their
      superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants. In the general
      administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their
      benefactor had established; but they frequently found occasions
      of exercising within their camp and palaces a secret persecution,
      144 for which the imprudent zeal of the Christians sometimes
      offered the most specious pretences. A sentence of death was
      executed upon Maximilianus, an African youth, who had been
      produced by his own father 1441 before the magistrate as a
      sufficient and legal recruit, but who obstinately persisted in
      declaring, that his conscience would not permit him to embrace
      the profession of a soldier. 145 It could scarcely be expected
      that any government should suffer the action of Marcellus the
      Centurion to pass with impunity. On the day of a public festival,
      that officer threw away his belt, his arms, and the ensigns of
      his office, and exclaimed with a loud voice, that he would obey
      none but Jesus Christ the eternal King, and that he renounced
      forever the use of carnal weapons, and the service of an
      idolatrous master. The soldiers, as soon as they recovered from
      their astonishment, secured the person of Marcellus. He was
      examined in the city of Tingi by the president of that part of
      Mauritania; and as he was convicted by his own confession, he was
      condemned and beheaded for the crime of desertion. 146 Examples
      of such a nature savor much less of religious persecution than of
      martial or even civil law; but they served to alienate the mind
      of the emperors, to justify the severity of Galerius, who
      dismissed a great number of Christian officers from their
      employments; and to authorize the opinion, that a sect of
      enthusiastics, which avowed principles so repugnant to the public
      safety, must either remain useless, or would soon become
      dangerous, subjects of the empire.

      144 (return) [ Eusebius, l. viii. c. 4, c. 17. He limits the
      number of military martyrs, by a remarkable expression, of which
      neither his Latin nor French translator have rendered the energy.
      Notwithstanding the authority of Eusebius, and the silence of
      Lactantius, Ambrose, Sulpicius, Orosius, &c., it has been long
      believed, that the Thebæan legion, consisting of 6000 Christians,
      suffered martyrdom by the order of Maximian, in the valley of the
      Pennine Alps. The story was first published about the middle of
      the 5th century, by Eucherius, bishop of Lyons, who received it
      from certain persons, who received it from Isaac, bishop of
      Geneva, who is said to have received it from Theodore, bishop of
      Octodurum. The abbey of St. Maurice still subsists, a rich
      monument of the credulity of Sigismund, king of Burgundy. See an

      father as a recruit,” but was obliged to appear by the law, which
      compelled the sons of soldiers to serve at 21 years old. Was not
      this a law of Constantine? Neither does this circumstance appear
      in the acts. His father had clearly expected him to serve, as he
      had bought him a new dress for the occasion; yet he refused to
      force the conscience of his son. and when Maximilian was
      condemned to death, the father returned home in joy, blessing God
      for having bestowed upon him such a son.—M.]

      146 (return) [ Acta Sincera, p. 302. * Note: M. Guizot here
      justly observes, that it was the necessity of sacrificing to the
      gods, which induced Marcellus to act in this manner.—M.]

      After the success of the Persian war had raised the hopes and the
      reputation of Galerius, he passed a winter with Diocletian in the
      palace of Nicomedia; and the fate of Christianity became the
      object of their secret consultations. 147 The experienced emperor
      was still inclined to pursue measures of lenity; and though he
      readily consented to exclude the Christians from holding any
      employments in the household or the army, he urged in the
      strongest terms the danger as well as cruelty of shedding the
      blood of those deluded fanatics. Galerius at length extorted 1471
      from him the permission of summoning a council, composed of a few
      persons the most distinguished in the civil and military
      departments of the state.

      The important question was agitated in their presence, and those
      ambitious courtiers easily discerned, that it was incumbent on
      them to second, by their eloquence, the importunate violence of
      the Cæsar. It may be presumed, that they insisted on every topic
      which might interest the pride, the piety, or the fears, of their
      sovereign in the destruction of Christianity. Perhaps they
      represented, that the glorious work of the deliverance of the
      empire was left imperfect, as long as an independent people was
      permitted to subsist and multiply in the heart of the provinces.
      The Christians, (it might specially be alleged,) renouncing the
      gods and the institutions of Rome, had constituted a distinct
      republic, which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired
      any military force; but which was already governed by its own
      laws and magistrates, was possessed of a public treasure, and was
      intimately connected in all its parts by the frequent assemblies
      of the bishops, to whose decrees their numerous and opulent
      congregations yielded an implicit obedience. Arguments like these
      may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to
      embrace a new system of persecution; but though we may suspect,
      it is not in our power to relate, the secret intrigues of the
      palace, the private views and resentments, the jealousy of women
      or eunuchs, and all those trifling but decisive causes which so
      often influence the fate of empires, and the councils of the
      wisest monarchs. 148

      acquire so accurate a knowledge of what passed in the Imperial
      cabinet. Note: * Lactantius, who was subsequently chosen by
      Constantine to educate Crispus, might easily have learned these
      details from Constantine himself, already of sufficient age to
      interest himself in the affairs of the government, and in a

      insaniam; placuit ergo amicorum sententiam experiri. (De Mort.
      Pers. c. 11.) But this measure was in accordance with the
      artificial character of Diocletian, who wished to have the
      appearance of doing good by his own impulse and evil by the
      impulse of others. Nam erat hujus malitiæ, cum bonum quid facere
      decrevisse sine consilio faciebat, ut ipse laudaretur. Cum autem

      severitatem suam aliena invidia vellet explere. Eutrop. ix. c.

      and was offended by the disregard of some of her Christian
      servants. * Note: This disregard consisted in the Christians
      fasting and praying instead of participating in the banquets and
      sacrifices which she celebrated with the Pagans. Dapibus
      sacrificabat pœne quotidie ac vicariis suis epulis exhibebat.

      The pleasure of the emperors was at length signified to the
      Christians, who, during the course of this melancholy winter, had
      expected, with anxiety, the result of so many secret
      consultations. The twenty-third of February, which coincided with
      the Roman festival of the Terminalia, 149 was appointed (whether
      from accident or design) to set bounds to the progress of
      Christianity. At the earliest dawn of day, the Prætorian præfect,
      150 accompanied by several generals, tribunes, and officers of
      the revenue, repaired to the principal church of Nicomedia, which
      was situated on an eminence in the most populous and beautiful
      part of the city. The doors were instantly broke open; they
      rushed into the sanctuary; and as they searched in vain for some
      visible object of worship, they were obliged to content
      themselves with committing to the flames the volumes of the holy
      Scripture. The ministers of Diocletian were followed by a
      numerous body of guards and pioneers, who marched in order of
      battle, and were provided with all the instruments used in the
      destruction of fortified cities. By their incessant labor, a
      sacred edifice, which towered above the Imperial palace, and had
      long excited the indignation and envy of the Gentiles, was in a
      few hours levelled with the ground. 151

      passage, to substitute _prœfectus_.]

      151 (return) [ Lactantius, de M. P. c. 12, gives a very lively
      picture of the destruction of the church.]

      The next day the general edict of persecution was published; 152
      and though Diocletian, still averse to the effusion of blood, had
      moderated the fury of Galerius, who proposed, that every one
      refusing to offer sacrifice should immediately be burnt alive,
      the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the Christians might
      be deemed sufficiently rigorous and effectual. It was enacted,
      that their churches, in all the provinces of the empire, should
      be demolished to their foundations; and the punishment of death
      was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret
      assemblies for the purpose of religious worship. The
      philosophers, who now assumed the unworthy office of directing
      the blind zeal of persecution, had diligently studied the nature
      and genius of the Christian religion; and as they were not
      ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were
      supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets, of the
      evangelists, and of the apostles, they most probably suggested
      the order, that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all
      their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates; who were
      commanded, under the severest penalties, to burn them in a public
      and solemn manner. By the same edict, the property of the church
      was at once confiscated; and the several parts of which it might
      consist were either sold to the highest bidder, united to the
      Imperial domain, bestowed on the cities and corporations, or
      granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers. After taking
      such effectual measures to abolish the worship, and to dissolve
      the government of the Christians, it was thought necessary to
      subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition of those
      perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of
      nature, of Rome, and of their ancestors. Persons of a liberal
      birth were declared incapable of holding any honors or
      employments; slaves were forever deprived of the hopes of
      freedom, and the whole body of the people were put out of the
      protection of the law. The judges were authorized to hear and to
      determine every action that was brought against a Christian. But
      the Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which
      they themselves had suffered; and thus those unfortunate
      sectaries were exposed to the severity, while they were excluded
      from the benefits, of public justice. This new species of
      martyrdom, so painful and lingering, so obscure and ignominious,
      was, perhaps, the most proper to weary the constancy of the
      faithful: nor can it be doubted that the passions and interest of
      mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of
      the emperors. But the policy of a well-ordered government must
      sometimes have interposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians;
      1521 nor was it possible for the Roman princes entirely to remove
      the apprehension of punishment, or to connive at every act of
      fraud and violence, without exposing their own authority and the
      rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers. 153

      152 (return) [ Mosheim, (p. 922—926,) from man scattered passages

      conjecture and refinement.]

      This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view, in the most
      conspicuous place of Nicomedia, before it was torn down by the
      hands of a Christian, who expressed at the same time, by the
      bitterest invectives, his contempt as well as abhorrence for such
      impious and tyrannical governors. His offence, according to the
      mildest laws, amounted to treason, and deserved death. And if it
      be true that he was a person of rank and education, those
      circumstances could serve only to aggravate his guilt. He was
      burnt, or rather roasted, by a slow fire; and his executioners,
      zealous to revenge the personal insult which had been offered to
      the emperors, exhausted every refinement of cruelty, without
      being able to subdue his patience, or to alter the steady and
      insulting smile which in his dying agonies he still preserved in
      his countenance. The Christians, though they confessed that his
      conduct had not been strictly conformable to the laws of
      prudence, admired the divine fervor of his zeal; and the
      excessive commendations which they lavished on the memory of
      their hero and martyr, contributed to fix a deep impression of
      terror and hatred in the mind of Diocletian. 154

      His fears were soon alarmed by the view of a danger from which he
      very narrowly escaped. Within fifteen days the palace of
      Nicomedia, and even the bed-chamber of Diocletian, were twice in
      flames; and though both times they were extinguished without any
      material damage, the singular repetition of the fire was justly
      considered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of
      chance or negligence. The suspicion naturally fell on the
      Christians; and it was suggested, with some degree of
      probability, that those desperate fanatics, provoked by their
      present sufferings, and apprehensive of impending calamities, had
      entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren, the
      eunuchs of the palace, against the lives of two emperors, whom
      they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the church of God.

      Jealousy and resentment prevailed in every breast, but especially
      in that of Diocletian. A great number of persons, distinguished
      either by the offices which they had filled, or by the favor
      which they had enjoyed, were thrown into prison. Every mode of
      torture was put in practice, and the court, as well as city, was
      polluted with many bloody executions. 155 But as it was found
      impossible to extort any discovery of this mysterious
      transaction, it seems incumbent on us either to presume the
      innocence, or to admire the resolution, of the sufferers. A few
      days afterwards Galerius hastily withdrew himself from Nicomedia,
      declaring, that if he delayed his departure from that devoted
      palace, he should fall a sacrifice to the rage of the Christians.

      The ecclesiastical historians, from whom alone we derive a
      partial and imperfect knowledge of this persecution, are at a
      loss how to account for the fears and dangers of the emperors.
      Two of these writers, a prince and a rhetorician, were
      eye-witnesses of the fire of Nicomedia. The one ascribes it to
      lightning, and the divine wrath; the other affirms, that it was
      kindled by the malice of Galerius himself. 156

      Eusebius (l. viii. c. 6) mentions the cruel executions of the
      eunuchs, Gorgonius and Dorotheus, and of Anthimius, bishop of
      Nicomedia; and both those writers describe, in a vague but
      tragical manner, the horrid scenes which were acted even in the
      Imperial presence.]

      156 (return) [ See Lactantius, Eusebius, and Constantine, ad
      Cœtum Sanctorum, c. xxv. Eusebius confesses his ignorance of the
      cause of this fire. Note: As the history of these times affords
      us no example of any attempts made by the Christians against
      their persecutors, we have no reason, not the slightest
      probability, to attribute to them the fire in the palace; and the
      authority of Constantine and Lactantius remains to explain it. M.
      de Tillemont has shown how they can be reconciled. Hist. des
      Empereurs, Vie de Diocletian, xix.—G. Had it been done by a
      Christian, it would probably have been a fanatic, who would have
      avowed and gloried in it. Tillemont’s supposition that the fire
      was first caused by lightning, and fed and increased by the
      malice of Galerius, seems singularly improbable.—M.]

      As the edict against the Christians was designed for a general
      law of the whole empire, and as Diocletian and Galerius, though
      they might not wait for the consent, were assured of the
      concurrence, of the Western princes, it would appear more
      consonant to our ideas of policy, that the governors of all the
      provinces should have received secret instructions to publish, on
      one and the same day, this declaration of war within their
      respective departments. It was at least to be expected, that the
      convenience of the public highways and established posts would
      have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the
      utmost despatch from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities
      of the Roman world; and that they would not have suffered fifty
      days to elapse, before the edict was published in Syria, and near
      four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa. 157

      This delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper of
      Diocletian, who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures
      of persecution, and who was desirous of trying the experiment
      under his more immediate eye, before he gave way to the disorders
      and discontent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant
      provinces. At first, indeed, the magistrates were restrained from
      the effusion of blood; but the use of every other severity was
      permitted, and even recommended to their zeal; nor could the
      Christians, though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of
      their churches, resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies,
      or to deliver their sacred books to the flames. The pious
      obstinacy of Felix, an African bishop, appears to have
      embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the government. The
      curator of his city sent him in chains to the proconsul. The
      proconsul transmitted him to the Prætorian præfect of Italy; and
      Felix, who disdained even to give an evasive answer, was at
      length beheaded at Venusia, in Lucania, a place on which the
      birth of Horace has conferred fame. 158 This precedent, and
      perhaps some Imperial rescript, which was issued in consequence
      of it, appeared to authorize the governors of provinces, in
      punishing with death the refusal of the Christians to deliver up
      their sacred books. There were undoubtedly many persons who
      embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown of martyrdom;
      but there were likewise too many who purchased an ignominious
      life, by discovering and betraying the holy Scripture into the
      hands of infidels. A great number even of bishops and presbyters
      acquired, by this criminal compliance, the opprobrious epithet of
      _Traditors;_ and their offence was productive of much present
      scandal and of much future discord in the African church. 159

      The copies as well as the versions of Scripture, were already so
      multiplied in the empire, that the most severe inquisition could
      no longer be attended with any fatal consequences; and even the
      sacrifice of those volumes, which, in every congregation, were
      preserved for public use, required the consent of some
      treacherous and unworthy Christians. But the ruin of the churches
      was easily effected by the authority of the government, and by
      the labor of the Pagans. In some provinces, however, the
      magistrates contented themselves with shutting up the places of
      religious worship. In others, they more literally complied with
      the terms of the edict; and after taking away the doors, the
      benches, and the pulpit, which they burnt as it were in a funeral
      pile, they completely demolished the remainder of the edifice.
      160 It is perhaps to this melancholy occasion that we should
      apply a very remarkable story, which is related with so many
      circumstances of variety and improbability, that it serves rather
      to excite than to satisfy our curiosity. In a small town in
      Phrygia, of whose name as well as situation we are left ignorant,
      it should seem that the magistrates and the body of the people
      had embraced the Christian faith; and as some resistance might be
      apprehended to the execution of the edict, the governor of the
      province was supported by a numerous detachment of legionaries.
      On their approach the citizens threw themselves into the church,
      with the resolution either of defending by arms that sacred
      edifice, or of perishing in its ruins. They indignantly rejected
      the notice and permission which was given them to retire, till
      the soldiers, provoked by their obstinate refusal, set fire to
      the building on all sides, and consumed, by this extraordinary
      kind of martyrdom, a great number of Phrygians, with their wives
      and children. 161

      160 (return) [ The ancient monuments, published at the end of
      Optatus, p. 261, &c. describe, in a very circumstantial manner,
      the proceedings of the governors in the destruction of churches.
      They made a minute inventory of the plate, &c., which they found
      in them. That of the church of Cirta, in Numidia, is still
      extant. It consisted of two chalices of gold, and six of silver;
      six urns, one kettle, seven lamps, all likewise of silver;
      besides a large quantity of brass utensils, and wearing apparel.]

      161 (return) [ Lactantius (Institut. Divin. v. 11) confines the
      calamity to the _conventiculum_, with its congregation. Eusebius
      (viii. 11) extends it to a whole city, and introduces something
      very like a regular siege. His ancient Latin translator, Rufinus,
      adds the important circumstance of the permission given to the
      inhabitants of retiring from thence. As Phrygia reached to the
      confines of Isauria, it is possible that the restless temper of
      those independent barbarians may have contributed to this
      misfortune. Note: Universum populum. Lact. Inst. Div. v. 11.—G.]

      Some slight disturbances, though they were suppressed almost as
      soon as excited, in Syria and the frontiers of Armenia, afforded
      the enemies of the church a very plausible occasion to insinuate,
      that those troubles had been secretly fomented by the intrigues
      of the bishops, who had already forgotten their ostentatious
      professions of passive and unlimited obedience. 162

      The resentment, or the fears, of Diocletian, at length
      transported him beyond the bounds of moderation, which he had
      hitherto preserved, and he declared, in a series of cruel edicts,
      1621 his intention of abolishing the Christian name. By the first
      of these edicts, the governors of the provinces were directed to
      apprehend all persons of the ecclesiastical order; and the
      prisons, destined for the vilest criminals, were soon filled with
      a multitude of bishops, presbyters, deacons, readers, and
      exorcists. By a second edict, the magistrates were commanded to
      employ every method of severity, which might reclaim them from
      their odious superstition, and oblige them to return to the
      established worship of the gods. This rigorous order was
      extended, by a subsequent edict, to the whole body of Christians,
      who were exposed to a violent and general persecution. 163

      Instead of those salutary restraints, which had required the
      direct and solemn testimony of an accuser, it became the duty as
      well as the interest of the Imperial officers to discover, to
      pursue, and to torment the most obnoxious among the faithful.
      Heavy penalties were denounced against all who should presume to
      save a prescribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods,
      and of the emperors. Yet, notwithstanding the severity of this
      law, the virtuous courage of many of the Pagans, in concealing
      their friends or relations, affords an honorable proof, that the
      rage of superstition had not extinguished in their minds the
      sentiments of nature and humanity. 164

      tribune Eugenius, who with only five hundred men seized Antioch,
      and might perhaps allure the Christians by the promise of
      religious toleration. From Eusebius, (l. ix. c. 8,) as well as
      from Moses of Chorene, (Hist. Armen. l. ii. 77, &c.,) it may be

      Chapter XVI: Conduct Towards The Christians, From Nero To
      Constantine.—Part VII.


      Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts against the
      Christians, than, as if he had been desirous of committing to
      other hands the work of persecution, he divested himself of the
      Imperial purple. The character and situation of his colleagues
      and successors sometimes urged them to enforce and sometimes
      inclined them to suspend, the execution of these rigorous laws;
      nor can we acquire a just and distinct idea of this important
      period of ecclesiastical history, unless we separately consider
      the state of Christianity, in the different parts of the empire,
      during the space of ten years, which elapsed between the first
      edicts of Diocletian and the final peace of the church.

      The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the
      oppression of any part of his subjects. The principal offices of
      his palace were exercised by Christians. He loved their persons,
      esteemed their fidelity, and entertained not any dislike to their
      religious principles. But as long as Constantius remained in the
      subordinate station of Cæsar, it was not in his power openly to
      reject the edicts of Diocletian, or to disobey the commands of
      Maximian. His authority contributed, however, to alleviate the
      sufferings which he pitied and abhorred. He consented with
      reluctance to the ruin of the churches; but he ventured to
      protect the Christians themselves from the fury of the populace,
      and from the rigor of the laws. The provinces of Gaul (under
      which we may probably include those of Britain) were indebted for
      the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed, to the gentle
      interposition of their sovereign. 165 But Datianus, the president
      or governor of Spain, actuated either by zeal or policy, chose
      rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors, than to
      understand the secret intentions of Constantius; and it can
      scarcely be doubted, that his provincial administration was
      stained with the blood of a few martyrs. 166

      The elevation of Constantius to the supreme and independent
      dignity of Augustus, gave a free scope to the exercise of his
      virtues, and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from
      establishing a system of toleration, of which he left the precept
      and the example to his son Constantine. His fortunate son, from
      the first moment of his accession, declaring himself the
      protector of the church, at length deserved the appellation of
      the first emperor who publicly professed and established the
      Christian religion. The motives of his conversion, as they may
      variously be deduced from benevolence, from policy, from
      conviction, or from remorse, and the progress of the revolution,
      which, under his powerful influence and that of his sons,
      rendered Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire,
      will form a very interesting and important chapter in the present
      volume of this history. At present it may be sufficient to
      observe, that every victory of Constantine was productive of some
      relief or benefit to the church.

      Constantius in the station of Cæsar, and the latter of the same
      prince in the rank of Augustus.]

      166 (return) [ Datianus is mentioned, in Gruter’s Inscriptions,
      as having determined the limits between the territories of Pax
      Julia, and those of Ebora, both cities in the southern part of
      Lusitania. If we recollect the neighborhood of those places to
      Cape St. Vincent, we may suspect that the celebrated deacon and
      martyr of that name had been inaccurately assigned by Prudentius,
      &c., to Saragossa, or Valentia. See the pompous history of his
      sufferings, in the Mémoires de Tillemont, tom. v. part ii. p.
      58-85. Some critics are of opinion, that the department of
      Constantius, as Cæsar, did not include Spain, which still
      continued under the immediate jurisdiction of Maximian.]

      The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced a short but violent
      persecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were strictly and
      cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian, who had long hated
      the Christians, and who delighted in acts of blood and violence.
      In the autumn of the first year of the persecution, the two
      emperors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph; several
      oppressive laws appear to have issued from their secret
      consultations, and the diligence of the magistrates was animated
      by the presence of their sovereigns. After Diocletian had
      divested himself of the purple, Italy and Africa were
      administered under the name of Severus, and were exposed, without
      defence, to the implacable resentment of his master Galerius.
      Among the martyrs of Rome, Adauctus deserves the notice of
      posterity. He was of a noble family in Italy, and had raised
      himself, through the successive honors of the palace, to the
      important office of treasurer of the private Jemesnes. Adauctus
      is the more remarkable for being the only person of rank and
      distinction who appears to have suffered death, during the whole
      course of this general persecution. 167

      well as the place of his martyrdom. * Note: M. Guizot suggests
      the powerful cunuchs of the palace. Dorotheus, Gorgonius, and
      Andrew, admitted by Gibbon himself to have been put to death, p.
      66.]

      The revolt of Maxentius immediately restored peace to the
      churches of Italy and Africa; and the same tyrant who oppressed
      every other class of his subjects, showed himself just, humane,
      and even partial, towards the afflicted Christians. He depended
      on their gratitude and affection, and very naturally presumed,
      that the injuries which they had suffered, and the dangers which
      they still apprehended from his most inveterate enemy, would
      secure the fidelity of a party already considerable by their
      numbers and opulence. 168 Even the conduct of Maxentius towards
      the bishops of Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof
      of his toleration, since it is probable that the most orthodox
      princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their
      established clergy. Marcellus, the former of these prelates, had
      thrown the capital into confusion, by the severe penance which he
      imposed on a great number of Christians, who, during the late
      persecution, had renounced or dissembled their religion. The rage
      of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions; the blood
      of the faithful was shed by each other’s hands, and the exile of
      Marcellus, whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than
      his zeal, was found to be the only measure capable of restoring
      peace to the distracted church of Rome. 169 The behavior of
      Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, appears to have been still more
      reprehensible. A deacon of that city had published a libel
      against the emperor. The offender took refuge in the episcopal
      palace; and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of
      ecclesiastical immunities, the bishop refused to deliver him up
      to the officers of justice. For this treasonable resistance,
      Mensurius was summoned to court, and instead of receiving a legal
      sentence of death or banishment, he was permitted, after a short
      examination, to return to his diocese. 170 Such was the happy
      condition of the Christian subjects of Maxentius, that whenever
      they were desirous of procuring for their own use any bodies of
      martyrs, they were obliged to purchase them from the most distant
      provinces of the East. A story is related of Aglae, a Roman lady,
      descended from a consular family, and possessed of so ample an
      estate, that it required the management of seventy-three
      stewards. Among these Boniface was the favorite of his mistress;
      and as Aglae mixed love with devotion, it is reported that he was
      admitted to share her bed. Her fortune enabled her to gratify the
      pious desire of obtaining some sacred relics from the East. She
      intrusted Boniface with a considerable sum of gold, and a large
      quantity of aromatics; and her lover, attended by twelve horsemen
      and three covered chariots, undertook a remote pilgrimage, as far
      as Tarsus in Cilicia. 171

      168 (return) [ Eusebius, l. viii. c. 14. But as Maxentius was
      vanquished by Constantine, it suited the purpose of Lactantius to
      place his death among those of the persecutors. * Note: M. Guizot
      directly contradicts this statement of Gibbon, and appeals to
      Eusebius. Maxentius, who assumed the power in Italy, pretended at
      first to be a Christian, to gain the favor of the Roman people;
      he ordered his ministers to cease to persecute the Christians,
      affecting a hypocritical piety, in order to appear more mild than
      his predecessors; but his actions soon proved that he was very
      different from what they had at first hoped. The actions of
      Maxentius were those of a cruel tyrant, but not those of a
      persecutor: the Christians, like the rest of his subjects,
      suffered from his vices, but they were not oppressed as a sect.
      Christian females were exposed to his lusts, as well as to the
      brutal violence of his colleague Maximian, but they were not
      selected as Christians.—M.]

      the history is doubtful.—G. ——Sir D. Dalrymple (Lord Hailes)

      Antiquities, ii. 64.—M.]

      The sanguinary temper of Galerius, the first and principal author
      of the persecution, was formidable to those Christians whom their
      misfortunes had placed within the limits of his dominions; and it
      may fairly be presumed that many persons of a middle rank, who
      were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty,
      very frequently deserted their native country, and sought a
      refuge in the milder climate of the West. 1711 As long as he
      commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could
      with difficulty either find or make a considerable number of
      martyrs, in a warlike country, which had entertained the
      missionaries of the gospel with more coldness and reluctance than
      any other part of the empire. 172 But when Galerius had obtained
      the supreme power, and the government of the East, he indulged in
      their fullest extent his zeal and cruelty, not only in the
      provinces of Thrace and Asia, which acknowledged his immediate
      jurisdiction, but in those of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, where
      Maximin gratified his own inclination, by yielding a rigorous
      obedience to the stern commands of his benefactor. 173 The
      frequent disappointments of his ambitious views, the experience
      of six years of persecution, and the salutary reflections which a
      lingering and painful distemper suggested to the mind of
      Galerius, at length convinced him that the most violent efforts
      of despotism are insufficient to extirpate a whole people, or to
      subdue their religious prejudices. Desirous of repairing the
      mischief that he had occasioned, he published in his own name,
      and in those of Licinius and Constantine, a general edict, which,
      after a pompous recital of the Imperial titles, proceeded in the
      following manner:—

      to the north of the Roman provinces, among the tribes of Germany:

      Emperors to take refuge among the Barbarians, were received with
      kindness. Euseb. de Vit. Constant. ii. 53. Semler Select. cap. H.

      painful trouble she answered, “It is thus that Christ, the Son of
      God, is to be honored.” Sozomen, ii. c. 6.—G.]

      his jurisdiction over Sirmium, the capital of that great
      province. See the Geographia Sacra of Charles de St. Paul, p.

      relate to the persecution of Galerius and Maximin. The general
      lamentations with which Lactantius opens the vth book of his
      Divine Institutions allude to their cruelty.] “Among the
      important cares which have occupied our mind for the utility and
      preservation of the empire, it was our intention to correct and
      reestablish all things according to the ancient laws and public
      discipline of the Romans. We were particularly desirous of
      reclaiming into the way of reason and nature, the deluded
      Christians who had renounced the religion and ceremonies
      instituted by their fathers; and presumptuously despising the
      practice of antiquity, had invented extravagant laws and
      opinions, according to the dictates of their fancy, and had
      collected a various society from the different provinces of our
      empire. The edicts, which we have published to enforce the
      worship of the gods, having exposed many of the Christians to
      danger and distress, many having suffered death, and many more,
      who still persist in their impious folly, being left destitute of
      _any_ public exercise of religion, we are disposed to extend to
      those unhappy men the effects of our wonted clemency. We permit
      them therefore freely to profess their private opinions, and to
      assemble in their conventicles without fear or molestation,
      provided always that they preserve a due respect to the
      established laws and government. By another rescript we shall
      signify our intentions to the judges and magistrates; and we hope
      that our indulgence will engage the Christians to offer up their
      prayers to the Deity whom they adore, for our safety and
      prosperity for their own, and for that of the republic.” 174 It
      is not usually in the language of edicts and manifestos that we
      should search for the real character or the secret motives of
      princes; but as these were the words of a dying emperor, his
      situation, perhaps, may be admitted as a pledge of his sincerity.

      174 (return) [ Eusebius (l. viii. c. 17) has given us a Greek
      version, and Lactantius (de M. P. c. 34) the Latin original, of
      this memorable edict. Neither of these writers seems to recollect
      how directly it contradicts whatever they have just affirmed of
      the remorse and repentance of Galerius. Note: But Gibbon has
      answered this by his just observation, that it is not in the
      language of edicts and manifestos that we should search * * for
      the secre motives of princes.—M.]

      When Galerius subscribed this edict of toleration, he was well
      assured that Licinius would readily comply with the inclinations
      of his friend and benefactor, and that any measures in favor of
      the Christians would obtain the approbation of Constantine. But
      the emperor would not venture to insert in the preamble the name
      of Maximin, whose consent was of the greatest importance, and who
      succeeded a few days afterwards to the provinces of Asia. In the
      first six months, however, of his new reign, Maximin affected to
      adopt the prudent counsels of his predecessor; and though he
      never condescended to secure the tranquillity of the church by a
      public edict, Sabinus, his Prætorian præfect, addressed a
      circular letter to all the governors and magistrates of the
      provinces, expatiating on the Imperial clemency, acknowledging
      the invincible obstinacy of the Christians, and directing the
      officers of justice to cease their ineffectual prosecutions, and
      to connive at the secret assemblies of those enthusiasts. In
      consequence of these orders, great numbers of Christians were
      released from prison, or delivered from the mines. The
      confessors, singing hymns of triumph, returned into their own
      countries; and those who had yielded to the violence of the
      tempest, solicited with tears of repentance their readmission
      into the bosom of the church. 175

      175 (return) [ Eusebius, l. ix. c. 1. He inserts the epistle of
      the præfect.]

      But this treacherous calm was of short duration; nor could the
      Christians of the East place any confidence in the character of
      their sovereign. Cruelty and superstition were the ruling
      passions of the soul of Maximin. The former suggested the means,
      the latter pointed out the objects of persecution. The emperor
      was devoted to the worship of the gods, to the study of magic,
      and to the belief of oracles. The prophets or philosophers, whom
      he revered as the favorites of Heaven, were frequently raised to
      the government of provinces, and admitted into his most secret
      councils. They easily convinced him that the Christians had been
      indebted for their victories to their regular discipline, and
      that the weakness of polytheism had principally flowed from a
      want of union and subordination among the ministers of religion.
      A system of government was therefore instituted, which was
      evidently copied from the policy of the church. In all the great
      cities of the empire, the temples were repaired and beautified by
      the order of Maximin, and the officiating priests of the various
      deities were subjected to the authority of a superior pontiff
      destined to oppose the bishop, and to promote the cause of
      paganism. These pontiffs acknowledged, in their turn, the supreme
      jurisdiction of the metropolitans or high priests of the
      province, who acted as the immediate vicegerents of the emperor
      himself. A white robe was the ensign of their dignity; and these
      new prelates were carefully selected from the most noble and
      opulent families. By the influence of the magistrates, and of the
      sacerdotal order, a great number of dutiful addresses were
      obtained, particularly from the cities of Nicomedia, Antioch, and
      Tyre, which artfully represented the well-known intentions of the
      court as the general sense of the people; solicited the emperor
      to consult the laws of justice rather than the dictates of his
      clemency; expressed their abhorrence of the Christians, and
      humbly prayed that those impious sectaries might at least be
      excluded from the limits of their respective territories. The
      answer of Maximin to the address which he obtained from the
      citizens of Tyre is still extant. He praises their zeal and
      devotion in terms of the highest satisfaction, descants on the
      obstinate impiety of the Christians, and betrays, by the
      readiness with which he consents to their banishment, that he
      considered himself as receiving, rather than as conferring, an
      obligation. The priests as well as the magistrates were empowered
      to enforce the execution of his edicts, which were engraved on
      tables of brass; and though it was recommended to them to avoid
      the effusion of blood, the most cruel and ignominious punishments
      were inflicted on the refractory Christians. 176

      176 (return) [ See Eusebius, l. viii. c. 14, l. ix. c. 2—8.
      Lactantius de M. P. c. 36. These writers agree in representing
      the arts of Maximin; but the former relates the execution of
      several martyrs, while the latter expressly affirms, occidi
      servos Dei vetuit. * Note: It is easy to reconcile them; it is
      sufficient to quote the entire text of Lactantius: Nam cum
      clementiam specie tenus profiteretur, occidi servos Dei vetuit,
      debilitari jussit. Itaque confessoribus effodiebantur oculi,
      amputabantur manus, nares vel auriculæ desecabantur. Hæc ille
      moliens Constantini litteris deterretur. Dissimulavit ergo, et
      tamen, si quis inciderit. mari occulte mergebatur. This detail of
      torments inflicted on the Christians easily reconciles Lactantius
      and Eusebius. Those who died in consequence of their tortures,
      those who were plunged into the sea, might well pass for martyrs.
      The mutilation of the words of Lactantius has alone given rise to
      the apparent contradiction.—G. ——Eusebius. ch. vi., relates the
      public martyrdom of the aged bishop of Emesa, with two others,
      who were thrown to the wild beasts, the beheading of Peter,
      bishop of Alexandria, with several others, and the death of
      Lucian, presbyter of Antioch, who was carried to Numidia, and put
      to death in prison. The contradiction is direct and undeniable,
      for although Eusebius may have misplaced the former martyrdoms,
      it may be doubted whether the authority of Maximin extended to
      Nicomedia till after the death of Galerius. The last edict of
      toleration issued by Maximin and published by Eusebius himself,
      Eccl. Hist. ix. 9. confirms the statement of Lactantius.—M.]

      The Asiatic Christians had every thing to dread from the severity
      of a bigoted monarch who prepared his measures of violence with
      such deliberate policy. But a few months had scarcely elapsed
      before the edicts published by the two Western emperors obliged
      Maximin to suspend the prosecution of his designs: the civil war
      which he so rashly undertook against Licinius employed all his
      attention; and the defeat and death of Maximin soon delivered the
      church from the last and most implacable of her enemies. 177

      177 (return) [ A few days before his death, he published a very
      ample edict of toleration, in which he imputes all the severities
      which the Christians suffered to the judges and governors, who
      had misunderstood his intentions.See the edict of Eusebius, l.
      ix. c. 10.]

      In this general view of the persecution, which was first
      authorized by the edicts of Diocletian, I have purposely
      refrained from describing the particular sufferings and deaths of
      the Christian martyrs. It would have been an easy task, from the
      history of Eusebius, from the declamations of Lactantius, and
      from the most ancient acts, to collect a long series of horrid
      and disgustful pictures, and to fill many pages with racks and
      scourges, with iron hooks and red-hot beds, and with all the
      variety of tortures which fire and steel, savage beasts, and more
      savage executioners, could inflict upon the human body. These
      melancholy scenes might be enlivened by a crowd of visions and
      miracles destined either to delay the death, to celebrate the
      triumph, or to discover the relics of those canonized saints who
      suffered for the name of Christ. But I cannot determine what I
      ought to transcribe, till I am satisfied how much I ought to
      believe. The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius
      himself, indirectly confesses, that he has related whatever might
      redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all that could
      tend to the disgrace, of religion. 178 Such an acknowledgment
      will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly
      violated one of the fundamental laws of history, has not paid a
      very strict regard to the observance of the other; and the
      suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of
      Eusebius, 1781 which was less tinctured with credulity, and more
      practised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his
      contemporaries. On some particular occasions, when the
      magistrates were exasperated by some personal motives of interest
      or resentment, the rules of prudence, and perhaps of decency, to
      overturn the altars, to pour out imprecations against the
      emperors, or to strike the judge as he sat on his tribunal, it
      may be presumed, that every mode of torture which cruelty could
      invent, or constancy could endure, was exhausted on those devoted
      victims. 179 Two circumstances, however, have been unwarily
      mentioned, which insinuate that the general treatment of the
      Christians, who had been apprehended by the officers of justice,
      was less intolerable than it is usually imagined to have been. 1.
      The confessors who were condemned to work in the mines were
      permitted by the humanity or the negligence of their keepers to
      build chapels, and freely to profess their religion in the midst
      of those dreary habitations. 180 2. The bishops were obliged to
      check and to censure the forward zeal of the Christians, who
      voluntarily threw themselves into the hands of the magistrates.
      Some of these were persons oppressed by poverty and debts, who
      blindly sought to terminate a miserable existence by a glorious
      death. Others were allured by the hope that a short confinement
      would expiate the sins of a whole life; and others again were
      actuated by the less honorable motive of deriving a plentiful
      subsistence, and perhaps a considerable profit, from the alms
      which the charity of the faithful bestowed on the prisoners. 181
      After the church had triumphed over all her enemies, the interest
      as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the
      merit of their respective sufferings. A convenient distance of
      time or place gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction; and
      the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs,
      whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been
      renewed, and whose lost members had miraculously been restored,
      were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every
      difficulty, and of silencing every objection. The most
      extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honor of the church,
      were applauded by the credulous multitude, countenanced by the
      power of the clergy, and attested by the suspicious evidence of
      ecclesiastical history.

      passages in Eusebius, l. viii. c. 2, and de Martyr. Palestin. c.

      to censure and suspicion. It was well known that he himself had
      been thrown into prison; and it was suggested that he had
      purchased his deliverance by some dishonorable compliance. The
      reproach was urged in his lifetime, and even in his presence, at

      martyrdom. Authorities are to be weighed, not excluded from

      detail which have been transmitted to us by the historians of the
      church, concerning the tortures endured by the Christians. Celsus

      sufferings of Tarachus and his companions, (Acta Sincera Ruinart,
      p. 419—448,) is filled with strong expressions of resentment and
      contempt, which could not fail of irritating the magistrate. The
      behavior of Ædesius to Hierocles, præfect of Egypt, was still
      more extraordinary. Euseb. de Martyr. Palestin. c. 5. * Note: M.
      Guizot states, that the acts of Tarachus and his companion
      contain nothing that appears dictated by violent feelings,

      attempt of Gibbon throughout this discussion, to find some flaw
      in the virtue and heroism of the martyrs, some extenuation for
      the cruelty of the persecutors. But truth must not be sacrificed
      even to well-grounded moral indignation. Though the language of
      these martyrs is in great part that of calm de fiance, of noble
      firmness, yet there are many expressions which betray “resentment
      and contempt.” “Children of Satan, worshippers of Devils,” is
      their common appellation of the heathen. One of them calls the
      judge another, one curses, and declares that he will curse the
      Emperors, as pestilential and bloodthirsty tyrants, whom God will
      soon visit in his wrath. On the other hand, though at first they
      speak the milder language of persuasion, the cold barbarity of
      the judges and officers might surely have called forth one
      sentence of abhorrence from Gibbon. On the first unsatisfactory
      answer, “Break his jaw,” is the order of the judge. They direct
      and witness the most excruciating tortures; the people, as M.
      Guizot observers, were so much revolted by the cruelty of Maximus
      that when the martyrs appeared in the amphitheatre, fear seized
      on all hearts, and general murmurs against the unjust judge rank
      through the assembly. It is singular, at least, that Gibbon
      should have quoted “as probably authentic,” acts so much
      embellished with miracle as these of Tarachus are, particularly
      towards the end.—M. * Note: Scarcely were the authorities
      informed of this, than the president of the province, a man, says
      Eusebius, harsh and cruel, banished the confessors, some to

      to be tormented by being set to the most painful labors. Four of
      them, whom he required to abjure their faith and refused, were
      burnt alive. Euseb. de Mart. Palest. c. xiii.—G. Two of these

      The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and
      torture, are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of
      an artful orator, 1811 that we are naturally induced to inquire
      into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind; the number of
      persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published
      by Diocletian, his associates, and his successors. The recent
      legendaries record whole armies and cities, which were at once
      swept away by the undistinguishing rage of persecution. The more
      ancient writers content themselves with pouring out a liberal
      effusion of loose and tragical invectives, without condescending
      to ascertain the precise number of those persons who were
      permitted to seal with their blood their belief of the gospel.
      From the history of Eusebius, it may, however, be collected, that
      only nine bishops were punished with death; and we are assured,
      by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine, 182
      that no more than ninety-two Christians were entitled to that
      honorable appellation. 1821 As we are unacquainted with the
      degree of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that
      time, it is not in our power to draw any useful inferences from
      the former of these facts: but the latter may serve to justify a
      very important and probable conclusion. According to the
      distribution of Roman provinces, Palestine may be considered as
      the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire: 183 and since there
      were some governors, who from a real or affected clemency had
      preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful,
      184 it is reasonable to believe, that the country which had given
      birth to Christianity, produced at least the sixteenth part of
      the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Galerius
      and Maximin; the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen
      hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between the ten
      years of the persecution, will allow an annual consumption of one
      hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the same proportion to the
      provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the end
      of two or three years, the rigor of the penal laws was either
      suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians in the Roman
      empire, on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicia,
      sentence, will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand
      persons. Since it cannot be doubted that the Christians were more
      numerous, and their enemies more exasperated, in the time of
      Diocletian, than they had ever been in any former persecution,
      this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate
      the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their
      lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into
      the world.

      numbers of the martyrs, compared to the unfair address with which
      Gibbon here quietly dismisses from the account all the horrible
      and excruciating tortures which fell short of death? The reader

      narration by assuring us that these were the martyrdoms inflicted
      in Palestine, during the _whole_ course of the persecution. The
      9th chapter of his viiith book, which relates to the province of
      Thebais in Egypt, may seem to contradict our moderate
      computation; but it will only lead us to admire the artful
      management of the historian. Choosing for the scene of the most
      exquisite cruelty the most remote and sequestered country of the
      Roman empire, he relates that in Thebais from ten to one hundred
      persons had frequently suffered martyrdom in the same day. But
      when he proceeds to mention his own journey into Egypt, his
      language insensibly becomes more cautious and moderate. Instead
      of a large, but definite number, he speaks of many Christians,
      and most artfully selects two ambiguous words, which may signify
      either what he had seen, or what he had heard; either the
      expectation, or the execution of the punishment. Having thus
      provided a secure evasion, he commits the equivocal passage to
      his readers and translators; justly conceiving that their piety
      would induce them to prefer the most favorable sense. There was
      perhaps some malice in the remark of Theodorus Metochita, that
      all who, like Eusebius, had been conversant with the Egyptians,
      delighted in an obscure and intricate style. (See Valesius ad

      only to the martyrs in the royal household.—M.] Dodwell had made,
      before Gibbon, this calculation and these objections; but Ruinart
      (Act. Mart. Pref p. 27, _et seq_.) has answered him in a
      peremptory manner: Nobis constat Eusebium in historia infinitos
      passim martyres admisisse. quamvis revera paucorum nomina
      recensuerit. Nec alium Eusebii interpretem quam ipsummet Eusebium
      proferimus, qui (l. iii. c. 33) ait sub Trajano plurimosa ex
      fidelibus martyrii certamen subiisse (l. v. init.) sub Antonino
      et Vero innumerabiles prope martyres per universum orbem

      loquitur, quæ an Dodwelli faveant conjectionibus judicet æquus
      lector. Even in the persecutions which Gibbon has represented as
      much more mild than that of Diocletian, the number of martyrs
      appears much greater than that to which he limits the martyrs of
      the latter: and this number is attested by incontestable
      monuments. I will quote but one example. We find among the
      letters of St. Cyprian one from Lucianus to Celerinus, written
      from the depth of a prison, in which Lucianus names seventeen of
      his brethren dead, some in the quarries, some in the midst of
      tortures some of starvation in prison. Jussi sumus (he proceeds)

      We shall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which
      obtrudes itself on the reluctant mind; that even admitting,
      without hesitation or inquiry, all that history has recorded, or
      devotion has feigned, on the subject of martyrdoms, it must still
      be acknowledged, that the Christians, in the course of their
      intestine dissensions, have inflicted far greater severities on
      each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels.
      During the ages of ignorance which followed the subversion of the
      Roman empire in the West, the bishops of the Imperial city
      extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the
      Latin church. The fabric of superstition which they had erected,
      and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of reason,
      was at length assaulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who from
      the twelfth to the sixteenth century assumed the popular
      character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by violence
      the empire which she had acquired by fraud; a system of peace and
      benevolence was soon disgraced by proscriptions, war, massacres,
      and the institution of the holy office. And as the reformers were
      animated by the love of civil as well as of religious freedom,
      the Catholic princes connected their own interest with that of
      the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the terrors of
      spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one
      hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles V. are said to have
      suffered by the hand of the executioner; and this extraordinary
      number is attested by Grotius, 185 a man of genius and learning,
      who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contending sects,
      and who composed the annals of his own age and country, at a time
      when the invention of printing had facilitated the means of
      intelligence, and increased the danger of detection.

      If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of
      Grotius, it must be allowed, that the number of Protestants, who
      were executed in a single province and a single reign, far
      exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three
      centuries, and of the Roman empire. But if the improbability of
      the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence; if
      Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and
      sufferings of the Reformers; 186 we shall be naturally led to
      inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and
      imperfect monuments of ancient credulity; what degree of credit
      can be assigned to a courtly bishop, and a passionate declaimer,
      1861 who, under the protection of Constantine, enjoyed the
      exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions inflicted on
      the Christians by the vanquished rivals or disregarded
      predecessors of their gracious sovereign.

      Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople.—Part I.

     Foundation Of Constantinople.—Political System Constantine, And
     His Successors.—Military Discipline.—The Palace.—The Finances.


      The unfortunate Licinius was the last rival who opposed the
      greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of
      Constantine. After a tranquil and prosperous reign, the conquerer
      bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire; a
      new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the
      innovations which he established have been embraced and
      consecrated by succeeding generations. The age of the great
      Constantine and his sons is filled with important events; but the
      historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless
      he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are
      connected only by the order of time. He will describe the
      political institutions that gave strength and stability to the
      empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions
      which hastened its decline. He will adopt the division unknown to
      the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of
      the Christians, and their intestine discord, will supply copious
      and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal.

      After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, his victorious rival
      proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in
      future times, the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire
      and religion of Constantine. The motives, whether of pride or of
      policy, which first induced Diocletian to withdraw himself from
      the ancient seat of government, had acquired additional weight by
      the example of his successors, and the habits of forty years.
      Rome was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which
      had once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the
      Cæsars was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince,
      born in the neighborhood of the Danube, educated in the courts
      and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions
      of Britain. The Italians, who had received Constantine as their
      deliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes
      condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but
      they were seldom honored with the presence of their new
      sovereign. During the vigor of his age, Constantine, according to
      the various exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity,
      or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his extensive
      dominions; and was always prepared to take the field either
      against a foreign or a domestic enemy. But as he gradually
      reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he
      began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent
      station the strength as well as majesty of the throne. In the
      choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred the confines of
      Europe and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who
      dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of
      jealousy the conduct of the Persian monarch, who indignantly
      supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With these views,
      Diocletian had selected and embellished the residence of
      Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was justly abhorred by
      the protector of the church: and Constantine was not insensible
      to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the
      glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war
      against Licinius, he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate,
      both as a soldier and as a statesman, the incomparable position
      of Byzantium; and to observe how strongly it was guarded by
      nature against a hostile attack, whilst it was accessible on
      every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse. Many ages
      before Constantine, one of the most judicious historians of
      antiquity1 had described the advantages of a situation, from
      whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the sea,
      and the honors of a flourishing and independent republic. 2

      1 (return) [ Polybius, l. iv. p. 423, edit. Casaubon. He observes
      that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently disturbed, and
      the extent of their territory contracted, by the inroads of the
      wild Thracians.]

      2 (return) [ The navigator Byzas, who was styled the son of
      Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the Christian æra. His
      followers were drawn from Argos and Megara. Byzantium was
      afterwards rebuild and fortified by the Spartan general
      Pausanias. See Scaliger Animadvers. ad Euseb. p. 81. Ducange,
      Constantinopolis, l. i part i. cap 15, 16. With regard to the
      wars of the Byzantines against Philip, the Gauls, and the kings
      of Bithynia, we should trust none but the ancient writers who
      lived before the greatness of the Imperial city had excited a
      spirit of flattery and fiction.]

      If we survey Byzantium in the extent which it acquired with the
      august name of Constantinople, the figure of the Imperial city
      may be represented under that of an unequal triangle. The obtuse
      point, which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia,
      meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus. The
      northern side of the city is bounded by the harbor; and the
      southern is washed by the Propontis, or Sea of Marmara. The basis
      of the triangle is opposed to the west, and terminates the
      continent of Europe. But the admirable form and division of the
      circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample
      explanation, be clearly or sufficiently understood. The winding
      channel through which the waters of the Euxine flow with a rapid
      and incessant course towards the Mediterranean, received the
      appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in the
      history, than in the fables, of antiquity. 3 A crowd of temples
      and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and
      woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the
      devotion of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the
      Argonauts, explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine. On
      these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of
      Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies; 4 and of the sylvan
      reign of Amycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combat of the
      cestus. 5 The straits of the Bosphorus are terminated by the
      Cyanean rocks, which, according to the description of the poets,
      had once floated on the face of the waters; and were destined by
      the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine against the eye of
      profane curiosity. 6 From the Cyanean rocks to the point and
      harbor of Byzantium, the winding length of the Bosphorus extends
      about sixteen miles, 7 and its most ordinary breadth may be
      computed at about one mile and a half. The new castles of Europe
      and Asia are constructed, on either continent, upon the
      foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter
      Urius. The _old_ castles, a work of the Greek emperors, command
      the narrowest part of the channel in a place where the opposite
      banks advance within five hundred paces of each other. These
      fortresses were destroyed and strengthened by Mahomet the Second,
      when he meditated the siege of Constantinople: 8 but the Turkish
      conqueror was most probably ignorant, that near two thousand
      years before his reign, Darius had chosen the same situation to
      connect the two continents by a bridge of boats. 9 At a small
      distance from the old castles we discover the little town of
      Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as the
      Asiatic suburb of Constantinople. The Bosphorus, as it begins to
      open into the Propontis, passes between Byzantium and Chalcedon.
      The latter of those cities was built by the Greeks, a few years
      before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who
      overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast, has
      been stigmatized by a proverbial expression of contempt. 10

      Phœnician name of those insects, their noisy flight, the stench

      drives them into the sea, all contribute to form the striking

      The harbor of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm
      of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the
      denomination of the _Golden Horn_. The curve which it describes
      might be compared to the horn of a stag, or as it should seem,
      with more propriety, to that of an ox. 11 The epithet of _golden_
      was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the
      most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of
      Constantinople. The River Lycus, formed by the conflux of two
      little streams, pours into the harbor a perpetual supply of fresh
      water, which serves to cleanse the bottom, and to invite the
      periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that
      convenient recess. As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt
      in those seas, the constant depth of the harbor allows goods to
      be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats; and it
      has been observed, that in many places the largest vessels may
      rest their prows against the houses, while their sterns are
      floating in the water. 12 From the mouth of the Lycus to that of
      the harbor, this arm of the Bosphorus is more than seven miles in
      length. The entrance is about five hundred yards broad, and a
      strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it, to guard the
      port and city from the attack of a hostile navy. 13

      Between the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, the shores of Europe
      and Asia, receding on either side, enclose the sea of Marmara,
      which was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis.
      The navigation from the issue of the Bosphorus to the entrance of
      the Hellespont is about one hundred and twenty miles.

      Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the
      Propontis, may at once descry the high lands of Thrace and
      Bithynia, and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount
      Olympus, covered with eternal snows. 14 They leave on the left a
      deep gulf, at the bottom of which Nicomedia was seated, the
      Imperial residence of Diocletian; and they pass the small islands
      of Cyzicus and Proconnesus before they cast anchor at Gallipoli;
      where the sea, which separates Asia from Europe, is again
      contracted into a narrow channel.

      14 (return) [ Thevenot (Voyages au Levant, part i. l. i. c. 14)

      (Observations, l. ii. c. 1.) gives a good description of the
      Propontis, but contents himself with the vague expression of one
      day and one night’s sail. When Sandy’s (Travels, p. 21) talks of
      150 furlongs in length, as well as breadth we can only suppose
      some mistake of the press in the text of that judicious
      traveller.]

      The geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have
      surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont, assign about
      sixty miles for the winding course, and about three miles for the
      ordinary breadth of those celebrated straits. 15 But the
      narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the
      old Turkish castles between the cities of Sestus and Abydus. It
      was here that the adventurous Leander braved the passage of the
      flood for the possession of his mistress. 16 It was here
      likewise, in a place where the distance between the opposite
      banks cannot exceed five hundred paces, that Xerxes imposed a
      stupendous bridge of boats, for the purpose of transporting into
      Europe a hundred and seventy myriads of barbarians. 17 A sea
      contracted within such narrow limits may seem but ill to deserve
      the singular epithet of _broad_, which Homer, as well as Orpheus,
      has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont. 1711 But our ideas of
      greatness are of a relative nature: the traveller, and especially
      the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who pursued the
      windings of the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery, which
      appeared on every side to terminate the prospect, insensibly lost
      the remembrance of the sea; and his fancy painted those
      celebrated straits, with all the attributes of a mighty river
      flowing with a swift current, in the midst of a woody and inland
      country, and at length, through a wide mouth, discharging itself
      into the Ægean or Archipelago. 18 Ancient Troy, 19 seated on a an
      eminence at the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the
      Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of waters from
      the tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simois and Scamander.
      The Grecian camp had stretched twelve miles along the shore from
      the Sigæan to the Rhætean promontory; and the flanks of the army
      were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners
      of Agamemnon. The first of those promontories was occupied by
      Achilles with his invincible myrmidons, and the dauntless Ajax
      pitched his tents on the other. After Ajax had fallen a sacrifice
      to his disappointed pride, and to the ingratitude of the Greeks,
      his sepulchre was erected on the ground where he had defended the
      navy against the rage of Jove and of Hector; and the citizens of
      the rising town of Rhæteum celebrated his memory with divine
      honors. 20 Before Constantine gave a just preference to the
      situation of Byzantium, he had conceived the design of erecting
      the seat of empire on this celebrated spot, from whence the
      Romans derived their fabulous origin. The extensive plain which
      lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhætean promontory and the
      tomb of Ajax, was first chosen for his new capital; and though
      the undertaking was soon relinquished the stately remains of
      unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who
      sailed through the straits of the Hellespont. 21

      capital. They both suppose with very little probability, that the
      emperor, if he had not been prevented by a prodigy, would have
      repeated the mistake of the _blind_ Chalcedonians.]

      We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of
      Constantinople; which appears to have been formed by nature for
      the centre and capital of a great monarchy. Situated in the
      forty-first degree of latitude, the Imperial city commanded, from
      her seven hills, 22 the opposite shores of Europe and Asia; the
      climate was healthy and temperate, the soil fertile, the harbor
      secure and capacious; and the approach on the side of the
      continent was of small extent and easy defence. The Bosphorus and
      the Hellespont may be considered as the two gates of
      Constantinople; and the prince who possessed those important
      passages could always shut them against a naval enemy, and open
      them to the fleets of commerce. The preservation of the eastern
      provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed to the policy of
      Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who in the
      preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the
      Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise of piracy, and
      despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier. When the gates
      of the Hellespont and Bosphorus were shut, the capital still
      enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which
      could supply the wants, or gratify the luxury, of its numerous
      inhabitants. The sea-coasts of Thrace and Bithynia, which
      languish under the weight of Turkish oppression, still exhibit a
      rich prospect of vineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful
      harvests; and the Propontis has ever been renowned for an
      inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish, that are taken in
      their stated seasons, without skill, and almost without labor. 23
      But when the passages of the straits were thrown open for trade,
      they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of
      the north and south, of the Euxine, and of the Mediterranean.
      Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of
      Germany and Scythia, and far as the sources of the Tanais and the
      Borysthenes; whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of Europe
      or Asia; the corn of Egypt, and the gems and spices of the
      farthest India, were brought by the varying winds into the port
      of Constantinople, which for many ages attracted the commerce of
      the ancient world. 24

      The prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in a
      single spot, was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine.
      But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has, in every
      age, been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of
      great cities, 25 the emperor was desirous of ascribing his
      resolution, not so much to the uncertain counsels of human
      policy, as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine
      wisdom. In one of his laws he has been careful to instruct
      posterity, that in obedience to the commands of God, he laid the
      everlasting foundations of Constantinople: 26 and though he has
      not condescended to relate in what manner the celestial
      inspiration was communicated to his mind, the defect of his
      modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of
      succeeding writers; who describe the nocturnal vision which
      appeared to the fancy of Constantine, as he slept within the
      walls of Byzantium. The tutelar genius of the city, a venerable
      matron sinking under the weight of years and infirmities, was
      suddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own hands
      adorned with all the symbols of Imperial greatness. 27 The
      monarch awoke, interpreted the auspicious omen, and obeyed,
      without hesitation, the will of Heaven. The day which gave birth
      to a city or colony was celebrated by the Romans with such
      ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition; 28
      and though Constantine might omit some rites which savored too
      strongly of their Pagan origin, yet he was anxious to leave a
      deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the
      spectators. On foot, with a lance in his hand, the emperor
      himself led the solemn procession; and directed the line, which
      was traced as the boundary of the destined capital: till the
      growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the
      assistants, who, at length, ventured to observe, that he had
      already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city. “I shall
      still advance,” replied Constantine, “till He, the invisible
      guide who marches before me, thinks proper to stop.” 29 Without
      presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this
      extraordinary conductor, we shall content ourselves with the more
      humble task of describing the extent and limits of
      Constantinople. 30

      Orientale of Banduri as the most complete; but, by a series of
      very nice observations, he reduced the extravagant proportion of
      the scale, and instead of 9500, determines the circumference of
      the city as consisting of about 7800 French _toises_.]

      In the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the
      Seraglio occupy the eastern promontory, the first of the seven
      hills, and cover about one hundred and fifty acres of our own
      measure. The seat of Turkish jealousy and despotism is erected on
      the foundations of a Grecian republic; but it may be supposed
      that the Byzantines were tempted by the conveniency of the harbor
      to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits
      of the Seraglio. The new walls of Constantine stretched from the
      port to the Propontis across the enlarged breadth of the
      triangle, at the distance of fifteen stadia from the ancient
      fortification; and with the city of Byzantium they enclosed five
      of the seven hills, which, to the eyes of those who approach
      Constantinople, appear to rise above each other in beautiful
      order. 31 About a century after the death of the founder, the new
      buildings, extending on one side up the harbor, and on the other
      along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the
      sixth, and the broad summit of the seventh hill. The necessity of
      protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the
      barbarians engaged the younger Theodosius to surround his capital
      with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls. 32 From the
      eastern promontory to the golden gate, the extreme length of
      Constantinople was about three Roman miles; 33 the circumference
      measured between ten and eleven; and the surface might be
      computed as equal to about two thousand English acres. It is
      impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations of
      modern travellers, who have sometimes stretched the limits of
      Constantinople over the adjacent villages of the European, and
      even of the Asiatic coast. 34 But the suburbs of Pera and Galata,
      though situate beyond the harbor, may deserve to be considered as
      a part of the city; 35 and this addition may perhaps authorize
      the measure of a Byzantine historian, who assigns sixteen Greek
      (about fourteen Roman) miles for the circumference of his native
      city. 36 Such an extent may not seem unworthy of an Imperial
      residence. Yet Constantinople must yield to Babylon and Thebes,
      37 to ancient Rome, to London, and even to Paris. 38

      Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople.—Part II.


      The master of the Roman world, who aspired to erect an eternal
      monument of the glories of his reign could employ in the
      prosecution of that great work, the wealth, the labor, and all
      that yet remained of the genius of obedient millions. Some
      estimate may be formed of the expense bestowed with Imperial
      liberality on the foundation of Constantinople, by the allowance
      of about two millions five hundred thousand pounds for the
      construction of the walls, the porticos, and the aqueducts. 39
      The forests that overshadowed the shores of the Euxine, and the
      celebrated quarries of white marble in the little island of
      Proconnesus, supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials, ready
      to be conveyed, by the convenience of a short water carriage, to
      the harbor of Byzantium. 40 A multitude of laborers and
      artificers urged the conclusion of the work with incessant toil:
      but the impatience of Constantine soon discovered, that, in the
      decline of the arts, the skill as well as numbers of his
      architects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his
      designs. The magistrates of the most distant provinces were
      therefore directed to institute schools, to appoint professors,
      and by the hopes of rewards and privileges, to engage in the
      study and practice of architecture a sufficient number of
      ingenious youths, who had received a liberal education. 41 The
      buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers as the
      reign of Constantine could afford; but they were decorated by the
      hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of Pericles and
      Alexander. To revive the genius of Phidias and Lysippus,
      surpassed indeed the power of a Roman emperor; but the immortal
      productions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed
      without defence to the rapacious vanity of a despot. By his
      commands the cities of Greece and Asia were despoiled of their
      most valuable ornaments. 42 The trophies of memorable wars, the
      objects of religious veneration, the most finished statues of the
      gods and heroes, of the sages and poets, of ancient times,
      contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople; and gave
      occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus, 43 who
      observes, with some enthusiasm, that nothing seemed wanting
      except the souls of the illustrious men whom these admirable
      monuments were intended to represent. But it is not in the city
      of Constantine, nor in the declining period of an empire, when
      the human mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery, that
      we should seek for the souls of Homer and of Demosthenes.

      During the siege of Byzantium, the conqueror had pitched his tent
      on the commanding eminence of the second hill. To perpetuate the
      memory of his success, he chose the same advantageous position
      for the principal Forum; 44 which appears to have been of a

      formed triumphal arches; the porticos, which enclosed it on every

      occupied by a lofty column, of which a mutilated fragment is now

      was erected on a pedestal of white marble twenty feet high; and

      about ten feet in height, and about thirty-three in
      circumference. 45 On the summit of the pillar, above one hundred
      and twenty feet from the ground, stood the colossal statue of
      Apollo. It was a bronze, had been transported either from Athens
      or from a town of Phrygia, and was supposed to be the work of
      Phidias. The artist had represented the god of day, or, as it was
      afterwards interpreted, the emperor Constantine himself, with a
      sceptre in his right hand, the globe of the world in his left,
      and a crown of rays glittering on his head. 46 The Circus, or
      Hippodrome, was a stately building about four hundred paces in
      length, and one hundred in breadth. 47 The space between the two
      _metæ_ or goals were filled with statues and obelisks; and we may
      still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity; the bodies of
      three serpents, twisted into one pillar of brass. Their triple
      heads had once supported the golden tripod which, after the
      defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the temple of Delphi by the
      victorious Greeks. 48 The beauty of the Hippodrome has been long
      since defaced by the rude hands of the Turkish conquerors; 4811
      but, under the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves
      as a place of exercise for their horses. From the throne, whence
      the emperor viewed the Circensian games, a winding staircase 49
      descended to the palace; a magnificent edifice, which scarcely
      yielded to the residence of Rome itself, and which, together with
      the dependent courts, gardens, and porticos, covered a
      considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis
      between the Hippodrome and the church of St. Sophia. 50 We might
      likewise celebrate the baths, which still retained the name of
      Zeuxippus, after they had been enriched, by the munificence of
      Constantine, with lofty columns, various marbles, and above
      threescore statues of bronze. 51 But we should deviate from the
      design of this history, if we attempted minutely to describe the
      different buildings or quarters of the city. It may be sufficient
      to observe, that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great
      capital, or contribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous
      inhabitants, was contained within the walls of Constantinople. A
      particular description, composed about a century after its
      foundation, enumerates a capitol or school of learning, a circus,
      two theatres, eight public, and one hundred and fifty-three
      private baths, fifty-two porticos, five granaries, eight
      aqueducts or reservoirs of water, four spacious halls for the
      meetings of the senate or courts of justice, fourteen churches,
      fourteen palaces, and four thousand three hundred and
      eighty-eight houses, which, for their size or beauty, deserved to
      be distinguished from the multitude of plebeian inhabitants. 52

      old capital consisted of 42 streets, the new of 322.]

      The populousness of his favored city was the next and most
      serious object of the attention of its founder. In the dark ages
      which succeeded the translation of the empire, the remote and the
      immediate consequences of that memorable event were strangely
      confounded by the vanity of the Greeks and the credulity of the
      Latins. 53 It was asserted, and believed, that all the noble
      families of Rome, the senate, and the equestrian order, with
      their innumerable attendants, had followed their emperor to the
      banks of the Propontis; that a spurious race of strangers and
      plebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient
      capital; and that the lands of Italy, long since converted into
      gardens, were at once deprived of cultivation and inhabitants. 54
      In the course of this history, such exaggerations will be reduced
      to their just value: yet, since the growth of Constantinople
      cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of
      industry, it must be admitted that this artificial colony was
      raised at the expense of the ancient cities of the empire. Many
      opulent senators of Rome, and of the eastern provinces, were
      probably invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the
      fortunate spot, which he had chosen for his own residence. The
      invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from
      commands; and the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and
      cheerful obedience. He bestowed on his favorites the palaces
      which he had built in the several quarters of the city, assigned
      them lands and pensions for the support of their dignity, 55 and
      alienated the demesnes of Pontus and Asia to grant hereditary
      estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital.
      56 But these encouragements and obligations soon became
      superfluous, and were gradually abolished. Wherever the seat of
      government is fixed, a considerable part of the public revenue
      will be expended by the prince himself, by his ministers, by the
      officers of justice, and by the domestics of the palace. The most
      wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the powerful
      motives of interest and duty, of amusement and curiosity. A third
      and more numerous class of inhabitants will insensibly be formed,
      of servants, of artificers, and of merchants, who derive their
      subsistence from their own labor, and from the wants or luxury of
      the superior ranks. In less than a century, Constantinople
      disputed with Rome itself the preëminence of riches and numbers.
      New piles of buildings, crowded together with too little regard
      to health or convenience, scarcely allowed the intervals of
      narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men, of horses, and of
      carriages. The allotted space of ground was insufficient to
      contain the increasing people; and the additional foundations,
      which, on either side, were advanced into the sea, might alone
      have composed a very considerable city. 57

      The frequent and regular distributions of wine and oil, of corn
      or bread, of money or provisions, had almost exempted the poorest
      citizens of Rome from the necessity of labor. The magnificence of
      the first Cæsars was in some measure imitated by the founder of
      Constantinople: 58 but his liberality, however it might excite
      the applause of the people, has incurred the censure of
      posterity. A nation of legislators and conquerors might assert
      their claim to the harvests of Africa, which had been purchased
      with their blood; and it was artfully contrived by Augustus,
      that, in the enjoyment of plenty, the Romans should lose the
      memory of freedom. But the prodigality of Constantine could not
      be excused by any consideration either of public or private
      interest; and the annual tribute of corn imposed upon Egypt for
      the benefit of his new capital, was applied to feed a lazy and
      insolent populace, at the expense of the husbandmen of an
      industrious province. 59 5911 Some other regulations of this
      emperor are less liable to blame, but they are less deserving of
      notice. He divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or
      quarters, 60 dignified the public council with the appellation of
      senate, 61 communicated to the citizens the privileges of Italy,
      62 and bestowed on the rising city the title of Colony, the first
      and most favored daughter of ancient Rome. The venerable parent
      still maintained the legal and acknowledged supremacy, which was
      due to her age, her dignity, and to the remembrance of her former

      old and the new capital.]

      As Constantine urged the progress of the work with the impatience
      of a lover, the walls, the porticos, and the principal edifices
      were completed in a few years, or, according to another account,
      in a few months; 64 but this extraordinary diligence should
      excite the less admiration, since many of the buildings were
      finished in so hasty and imperfect a manner, that under the
      succeeding reign, they were preserved with difficulty from
      impending ruin. 65 But while they displayed the vigor and
      freshness of youth, the founder prepared to celebrate the
      dedication of his city. 66 The games and largesses which crowned
      the pomp of this memorable festival may easily be supposed; but
      there is one circumstance of a more singular and permanent
      nature, which ought not entirely to be overlooked. As often as
      the birthday of the city returned, the statue of Constantine,
      framed by his order, of gilt wood, and bearing in his right hand
      a small image of the genius of the place, was erected on a
      triumphal car. The guards, carrying white tapers, and clothed in
      their richest apparel, accompanied the solemn procession as it
      moved through the Hippodrome. When it was opposite to the throne
      of the reigning emperor, he rose from his seat, and with grateful
      reverence adored the memory of his predecessor. 67 At the
      festival of the dedication, an edict, engraved on a column of
      marble, bestowed the title of Second or New Rome on the city of
      Constantine. 68 But the name of Constantinople 69 has prevailed
      over that honorable epithet; and after the revolution of fourteen
      centuries, still perpetuates the fame of its author. 70

      was dedicated the 11th of May, 5838, (A. D. 330.) He connects

      The foundation of a new capital is naturally connected with the
      establishment of a new form of civil and military administration.
      The distinct view of the complicated system of policy, introduced
      by Diocletian, improved by Constantine, and completed by his
      immediate successors, may not only amuse the fancy by the
      singular picture of a great empire, but will tend to illustrate
      the secret and internal causes of its rapid decay. In the pursuit
      of any remarkable institution, we may be frequently led into the
      more early or the more recent times of the Roman history; but the
      proper limits of this inquiry will be included within a period of
      about one hundred and thirty years, from the accession of
      Constantine to the publication of the Theodosian code; 71 from
      which, as well as from the _Notitia_ 7111 of the East and West,
      72 we derive the most copious and authentic information of the
      state of the empire. This variety of objects will suspend, for
      some time, the course of the narrative; but the interruption will
      be censured only by those readers who are insensible to the
      importance of laws and manners, while they peruse, with eager
      curiosity, the transient intrigues of a court, or the accidental
      event of a battle.

      The manly pride of the Romans, content with substantial power,
      had left to the vanity of the East the forms and ceremonies of
      ostentatious greatness. 73 But when they lost even the semblance
      of those virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom,
      the simplicity of Roman manners was insensibly corrupted by the
      stately affectation of the courts of Asia. The distinctions of
      personal merit and influence, so conspicuous in a republic, so
      feeble and obscure under a monarchy, were abolished by the
      despotism of the emperors; who substituted in their room a severe
      subordination of rank and office from the titled slaves who were
      seated on the steps of the throne, to the meanest instruments of
      arbitrary power. This multitude of abject dependants was
      interested in the support of the actual government from the dread
      of a revolution, which might at once confound their hopes and
      intercept the reward of their services. In this divine hierarchy
      (for such it is frequently styled) every rank was marked with the
      most scrupulous exactness, and its dignity was displayed in a
      variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies, which it was a study
      to learn, and a sacrilege to neglect. 74 The purity of the Latin
      language was debased, by adopting, in the intercourse of pride
      and flattery, a profusion of epithets, which Tully would scarcely
      have understood, and which Augustus would have rejected with
      indignation. The principal officers of the empire were saluted,
      even by the sovereign himself, with the deceitful titles of your
      _Sincerity_, your _Gravity_, your _Excellency_, your _Eminence_,
      your _sublime and wonderful Magnitude_, your _illustrious and
      magnificent Highness_. 75 The codicils or patents of their office
      were curiously emblazoned with such emblems as were best adapted
      to explain its nature and high dignity; the image or portrait of
      the reigning emperors; a triumphal car; the book of mandates
      placed on a table, covered with a rich carpet, and illuminated by
      four tapers; the allegorical figures of the provinces which they
      governed; or the appellations and standards of the troops whom
      they commanded. Some of these official ensigns were really
      exhibited in their hall of audience; others preceded their
      pompous march whenever they appeared in public; and every
      circumstance of their demeanor, their dress, their ornaments, and
      their train, was calculated to inspire a deep reverence for the
      representatives of supreme majesty. By a philosophic observer,
      the system of the Roman government might have been mistaken for a
      splendid theatre, filled with players of every character and
      degree, who repeated the language, and imitated the passions, of
      their original model. 76

      All the magistrates of sufficient importance to find a place in
      the general state of the empire, were accurately divided into
      three classes. 1. The _Illustrious_. 2. The _Spectabiles_, or
      _Respectable_. And, 3. the _Clarissimi;_ whom we may translate by
      the word _Honorable_. In the times of Roman simplicity, the
      last-mentioned epithet was used only as a vague expression of
      deference, till it became at length the peculiar and appropriated
      title of all who were members of the senate, 77 and consequently
      of all who, from that venerable body, were selected to govern the
      provinces. The vanity of those who, from their rank and office,
      might claim a superior distinction above the rest of the
      senatorial order, was long afterwards indulged with the new
      appellation of _Respectable;_ but the title of _Illustrious_ was
      always reserved to some eminent personages who were obeyed or
      reverenced by the two subordinate classes. It was communicated
      only, I. To the consuls and patricians; II. To the Prætorian
      præfects, with the præfects of Rome and Constantinople; III. To
      the masters-general of the cavalry and the infantry; and IV. To
      the seven ministers of the palace, who exercised their _sacred_
      functions about the person of the emperor. 78 Among those
      illustrious magistrates who were esteemed coordinate with each
      other, the seniority of appointment gave place to the union of
      dignities. 79 By the expedient of honorary codicils, the
      emperors, who were fond of multiplying their favors, might
      sometimes gratify the vanity, though not the ambition, of
      impatient courtiers. 80

      I. As long as the Roman consuls were the first magistrates of a
      free state, they derived their right to power from the choice of
      the people. As long as the emperors condescended to disguise the
      servitude which they imposed, the consuls were still elected by
      the real or apparent suffrage of the senate. From the reign of
      Diocletian, even these vestiges of liberty were abolished, and
      the successful candidates who were invested with the annual
      honors of the consulship, affected to deplore the humiliating
      condition of their predecessors. The Scipios and the Catos had
      been reduced to solicit the votes of plebeians, to pass through
      the tedious and expensive forms of a popular election, and to
      expose their dignity to the shame of a public refusal; while
      their own happier fate had reserved them for an age and
      government in which the rewards of virtue were assigned by the
      unerring wisdom of a gracious sovereign. 81 In the epistles which
      the emperor addressed to the two consuls elect, it was declared,
      that they were created by his sole authority. 82 Their names and
      portraits, engraved on gilt tables of ivory, were dispersed over
      the empire as presents to the provinces, the cities, the
      magistrates, the senate, and the people. 83 Their solemn
      inauguration was performed at the place of the Imperial
      residence; and during a period of one hundred and twenty years,

      From the reign of Carus to the sixth consulship of Honorius,
      there was an interval of one hundred and twenty years, during
      which the emperors were always absent from Rome on the first day
      of January. See the Chronologie de Tillemonte, tom. iii. iv. and
      v.]

      On the morning of the first of January, the consuls assumed the
      ensigns of their dignity. Their dress was a robe of purple,
      embroidered in silk and gold, and sometimes ornamented with
      costly gems. 85 On this solemn occasion they were attended by the
      most eminent officers of the state and army, in the habit of
      senators; and the useless fasces, armed with the once formidable
      axes, were borne before them by the lictors. The procession moved
      from the palace 87 to the Forum or principal square of the city;
      where the consuls ascended their tribunal, and seated themselves
      in the curule chairs, which were framed after the fashion of
      ancient times. They immediately exercised an act of jurisdiction,
      by the manumission of a slave, who was brought before them for
      that purpose; and the ceremony was intended to represent the
      celebrated action of the elder Brutus, the author of liberty and
      of the consulship, when he admitted among his fellow-citizens the
      faithful Vindex, who had revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins.
      88 The public festival was continued during several days in all
      the principal cities in Rome, from custom; in Constantinople,
      from imitation in Carthage, Antioch, and Alexandria, from the
      love of pleasure, and the superfluity of wealth. 89 In the two
      capitals of the empire the annual games of the theatre, the
      circus, and the amphitheatre, 90 cost four thousand pounds of
      gold, (about) one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling: and
      if so heavy an expense surpassed the faculties or the
      inclinations of the magistrates themselves, the sum was supplied
      from the Imperial treasury. 91 As soon as the consuls had
      discharged these customary duties, they were at liberty to retire
      into the shade of private life, and to enjoy, during the
      remainder of the year, the undisturbed contemplation of their own
      greatness. They no longer presided in the national councils; they
      no longer executed the resolutions of peace or war. Their
      abilities (unless they were employed in more effective offices)
      were of little moment; and their names served only as the legal
      date of the year in which they had filled the chair of Marius and
      of Cicero. Yet it was still felt and acknowledged, in the last
      period of Roman servitude, that this empty name might be
      compared, and even preferred, to the possession of substantial
      power. The title of consul was still the most splendid object of
      ambition, the noblest reward of virtue and loyalty. The emperors
      themselves, who disdained the faint shadow of the republic, were
      conscious that they acquired an additional splendor and majesty
      as often as they assumed the annual honors of the consular
      dignity. 92

      The proudest and most perfect separation which can be found in
      any age or country, between the nobles and the people, is perhaps
      that of the Patricians and the Plebeians, as it was established
      in the first age of the Roman republic. Wealth and honors, the
      offices of the state, and the ceremonies of religion, were almost
      exclusively possessed by the former who, preserving the purity of
      their blood with the most insulting jealousy, 93 held their
      clients in a condition of specious vassalage. But these
      distinctions, so incompatible with the spirit of a free people,
      were removed, after a long struggle, by the persevering efforts
      of the Tribunes. The most active and successful of the Plebeians
      accumulated wealth, aspired to honors, deserved triumphs,
      contracted alliances, and, after some generations, assumed the
      pride of ancient nobility. 94 The Patrician families, on the
      other hand, whose original number was never recruited till the
      end of the commonwealth, either failed in the ordinary course of
      nature, or were extinguished in so many foreign and domestic
      wars, or, through a want of merit or fortune, insensibly mingled
      with the mass of the people. 95 Very few remained who could
      derive their pure and genuine origin from the infancy of the
      city, or even from that of the republic, when Cæsar and Augustus,
      Claudius and Vespasian, created from the body of the senate a
      competent number of new Patrician families, in the hope of
      perpetuating an order, which was still considered as honorable
      and sacred. 96 But these artificial supplies (in which the
      reigning house was always included) were rapidly swept away by
      the rage of tyrants, by frequent revolutions, by the change of
      manners, and by the intermixture of nations. 97 Little more was
      left when Constantine ascended the throne, than a vague and
      imperfect tradition, that the Patricians had once been the first
      of the Romans. To form a body of nobles, whose influence may
      restrain, while it secures the authority of the monarch, would
      have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of
      Constantine; but had he seriously entertained such a design, it
      might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify, by an
      arbitrary edict, an institution which must expect the sanction of
      time and of opinion. He revived, indeed, the title of Patricians,
      but he revived it as a personal, not as an hereditary
      distinction. They yielded only to the transient superiority of
      the annual consuls; but they enjoyed the pre-eminence over all
      the great officers of state, with the most familiar access to the
      person of the prince. This honorable rank was bestowed on them
      for life; and as they were usually favorites, and ministers who
      had grown old in the Imperial court, the true etymology of the
      word was perverted by ignorance and flattery; and the Patricians
      of Constantine were reverenced as the adopted _Fathers_ of the
      emperor and the republic. 98

      of his lieutenant Marius. (c. 64.) Two hundred years before, the
      race of the Metelli themselves were confounded among the

      and with the other the standard, of the empire. The ambition of
      the præfects, always formidable, and sometimes fatal to the
      masters whom they served, was supported by the strength of the
      Prætorian bands; but after those haughty troops had been weakened
      by Diocletian, and finally suppressed by Constantine, the
      præfects, who survived their fall, were reduced without
      difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers. When
      they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor’s
      person, they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto
      claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace.
      They were deprived by Constantine of all military command, as
      soon as they had ceased to lead into the field, under their
      immediate orders, the flower of the Roman troops; and at length,
      by a singular revolution, the captains of the guards were
      transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces.
      According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian, the
      four princes had each their Prætorian præfect; and after the
      monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine, he
      still continued to create the same number of Four Præfects, and
      intrusted to their care the same provinces which they already
      administered. 1. The præfect of the East stretched his ample
      jurisdiction into the three parts of the globe which were subject
      to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the
      Phasis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of
      Persia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia,
      and Greece, once acknowledged the authority of the præfect of
      Illyricum. 3. The power of the præfect of Italy was not confined
      to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over
      the additional territory of Rhætia as far as the banks of the
      Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over
      that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the
      confines of Cyrene and those of Tingitania. 4. The præfect of the
      Gauls comprehended under that plural denomination the kindred
      provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from
      the wall of Antoninus to the foot of Mount Atlas. 99

      fortunately possessed this satisfactory account of the division
      of the power and provinces of the Prætorian præfects, we should
      frequently have been perplexed amidst the copious details of the
      Code, and the circumstantial minuteness of the Notitia.]

      After the Prætorian præfects had been dismissed from all military
      command, the civil functions which they were ordained to exercise
      over so many subject nations, were adequate to the ambition and
      abilities of the most consummate ministers. To their wisdom was
      committed the supreme administration of justice and of the
      finances, the two objects which, in a state of peace, comprehend
      almost all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the
      people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are obedient
      to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the share of their
      property which is required for the expenses of the state. The
      coin, the highways, the posts, the granaries, the manufactures,
      whatever could interest the public prosperity, was moderated by
      the authority of the Prætorian præfects. As the immediate
      representatives of the Imperial majesty, they were empowered to
      explain, to enforce, and on some occasions to modify, the general
      edicts by their discretionary proclamations. They watched over
      the conduct of the provincial governors, removed the negligent,
      and inflicted punishments on the guilty. From all the inferior
      jurisdictions, an appeal in every matter of importance, either
      civil or criminal, might be brought before the tribunal of the
      præfect; but _his_ sentence was final and absolute; and the
      emperors themselves refused to admit any complaints against the
      judgment or the integrity of a magistrate whom they honored with
      such unbounded confidence. 100 His appointments were suitable to
      his dignity; 101 and if avarice was his ruling passion, he
      enjoyed frequent opportunities of collecting a rich harvest of
      fees, of presents, and of perquisites. Though the emperors no
      longer dreaded the ambition of their præfects, they were
      attentive to counterbalance the power of this great office by the
      uncertainty and shortness of its duration. 102

      historical materials. From those authors, Dr. Howell (History of
      the World, vol. ii. p. 24-77) has deduced a very distinct
      abridgment of the state of the Roman empire]

      From their superior importance and dignity, Rome and
      Constantinople were alone excepted from the jurisdiction of the
      Prætorian præfects. The immense size of the city, and the
      experience of the tardy, ineffectual operation of the laws, had
      furnished the policy of Augustus with a specious pretence for
      introducing a new magistrate, who alone could restrain a servile
      and turbulent populace by the strong arm of arbitrary power. 103
      Valerius Messalla was appointed the first præfect of Rome, that
      his reputation might countenance so invidious a measure; but, at
      the end of a few days, that accomplished citizen 104 resigned his
      office, declaring, with a spirit worthy of the friend of Brutus,
      that he found himself incapable of exercising a power
      incompatible with public freedom. 105 As the sense of liberty
      became less exquisite, the advantages of order were more clearly
      understood; and the præfect, who seemed to have been designed as
      a terror only to slaves and vagrants, was permitted to extend his
      civil and criminal jurisdiction over the equestrian and noble
      families of Rome. The prætors, annually created as the judges of
      law and equity, could not long dispute the possession of the
      Forum with a vigorous and permanent magistrate, who was usually
      admitted into the confidence of the prince. Their courts were
      deserted, their number, which had once fluctuated between twelve
      and eighteen, 106 was gradually reduced to two or three, and
      their important functions were confined to the expensive
      obligation 107 of exhibiting games for the amusement of the
      people. After the office of the Roman consuls had been changed
      into a vain pageant, which was rarely displayed in the capital,
      the præfects assumed their vacant place in the senate, and were
      soon acknowledged as the ordinary presidents of that venerable
      assembly. They received appeals from the distance of one hundred
      miles; and it was allowed as a principle of jurisprudence, that
      all municipal authority was derived from them alone. 108 In the
      discharge of his laborious employment, the governor of Rome was
      assisted by fifteen officers, some of whom had been originally
      his equals, or even his superiors. The principal departments were
      relative to the command of a numerous watch, established as a
      safeguard against fires, robberies, and nocturnal disorders; the
      custody and distribution of the public allowance of corn and
      provisions; the care of the port, of the aqueducts, of the common
      sewers, and of the navigation and bed of the Tyber; the
      inspection of the markets, the theatres, and of the private as
      well as the public works. Their vigilance insured the three
      principal objects of a regular police, safety, plenty, and
      cleanliness; and as a proof of the attention of government to
      preserve the splendor and ornaments of the capital, a particular
      inspector was appointed for the statues; the guardian, as it
      were, of that inanimate people, which, according to the
      extravagant computation of an old writer, was scarcely inferior
      in number to the living inhabitants of Rome. About thirty years
      after the foundation of Constantinople, a similar magistrate was
      created in that rising metropolis, for the same uses and with the
      same powers. A perfect equality was established between the
      dignity of the _two_ municipal, and that of the _four_ Prætorian
      præfects. 109

      conquerors; and uniformly asserted his freedom and dignity in the

      conquest of Aquitain. As an orator, he disputed the palm of
      eloquence with Cicero himself. Messalla cultivated every muse,

      Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople.—Part IV.


      Those who, in the imperial hierarchy, were distinguished by the
      title of _Respectable_, formed an intermediate class between the
      _illustrious_ præfects, and the _honorable_ magistrates of the
      provinces. In this class the proconsuls of Asia, Achaia, and
      Africa, claimed a preëminence, which was yielded to the
      remembrance of their ancient dignity; and the appeal from their
      tribunal to that of the præfects was almost the only mark of
      their dependence. 110 But the civil government of the empire was
      distributed into thirteen great Dioceses, each of which equalled
      the just measure of a powerful kingdom. The first of these
      dioceses was subject to the jurisdiction of the _count_ of the
      east; and we may convey some idea of the importance and variety
      of his functions, by observing, that six hundred apparitors, who
      would be styled at present either secretaries, or clerks, or
      ushers, or messengers, were employed in his immediate office. 111
      The place of _Augustal præfect_ of Egypt was no longer filled by
      a Roman knight; but the name was retained; and the extraordinary
      powers which the situation of the country, and the temper of the
      inhabitants, had once made indispensable, were still continued to
      the governor. The eleven remaining dioceses, of Asiana, Pontica,
      and Thrace; of Macedonia, Dacia, and Pannonia, or Western
      Illyricum; of Italy and Africa; of Gaul, Spain, and Britain; were
      governed by twelve _vicars_ or _vice-præfects_, 112 whose name
      sufficiently explains the nature and dependence of their office.
      It may be added, that the lieutenant-generals of the Roman
      armies, the military counts and dukes, who will be hereafter
      mentioned, were allowed the rank and title of _Respectable_.

      112 (return) [ In Italy there was likewise the _Vicar of Rome_.
      It has been much disputed whether his jurisdiction measured one
      hundred miles from the city, or whether it stretched over the ten
      thousand provinces of Italy.]

      As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed in the
      councils of the emperors, they proceeded with anxious diligence
      to divide the substance and to multiply the titles of power. The
      vast countries which the Roman conquerors had united under the
      same simple form of administration, were imperceptibly crumbled
      into minute fragments; till at length the whole empire was
      distributed into one hundred and sixteen provinces, each of which
      supported an expensive and splendid establishment. Of these,
      three were governed by _proconsuls_, thirty-seven by _consulars_,
      five by _correctors_, and seventy-one by _presidents_. The
      appellations of these magistrates were different; they ranked in
      successive order, and the ensigns of and their situation, from
      accidental circumstances, might be more or less agreeable or
      advantageous. But they were all (excepting only the pro-consuls)
      alike included in the class of _honorable_ persons; and they were
      alike intrusted, during the pleasure of the prince, and under the
      authority of the præfects or their deputies, with the
      administration of justice and the finances in their respective
      districts. The ponderous volumes of the Codes and Pandects 113
      would furnish ample materials for a minute inquiry into the
      system of provincial government, as in the space of six centuries
      it was approved by the wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers.

      It may be sufficient for the historian to select two singular and
      salutary provisions, intended to restrain the abuse of authority.

      1. For the preservation of peace and order, the governors of the
      provinces were armed with the sword of justice. They inflicted
      corporal punishments, and they exercised, in capital offences,
      the power of life and death. But they were not authorized to
      indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own
      execution, or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most
      honorable kind of exile. These prerogatives were reserved to the
      præfects, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds
      of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight
      of a few ounces. 114 This distinction, which seems to grant the
      larger, while it denies the smaller degree of authority, was
      founded on a very rational motive. The smaller degree was
      infinitely more liable to abuse. The passions of a provincial
      magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression,
      which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject;
      though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he
      might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood. It may
      likewise be considered, that exile, considerable fines, or the
      choice of an easy death, relate more particularly to the rich and
      the noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or
      resentment of a provincial magistrate, were thus removed from his
      obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of
      the Prætorian præfect. 2. As it was reasonably apprehended that
      the integrity of the judge might be biased, if his interest was
      concerned, or his affections were engaged, the strictest
      regulations were established, to exclude any person, without the
      special dispensation of the emperor, from the government of the
      province where he was born; 115 and to prohibit the governor or
      his son from contracting marriage with a native, or an
      inhabitant; 116 or from purchasing slaves, lands, or houses,
      within the extent of his jurisdiction. 117 Notwithstanding these
      rigorous precautions, the emperor Constantine, after a reign of
      twenty-five years, still deplores the venal and oppressive
      administration of justice, and expresses the warmest indignation
      that the audience of the judge, his despatch of business, his
      seasonable delays, and his final sentence, were publicly sold,
      either by himself or by the officers of his court. The
      continuance, and perhaps the impunity, of these crimes, is
      attested by the repetition of impotent laws and ineffectual
      menaces. 118

      All the civil magistrates were drawn from the profession of the
      law. The celebrated Institutes of Justinian are addressed to the
      youth of his dominions, who had devoted themselves to the study
      of Roman jurisprudence; and the sovereign condescends to animate
      their diligence, by the assurance that their skill and ability
      would in time be rewarded by an adequate share in the government
      of the republic. 119 The rudiments of this lucrative science were
      taught in all the considerable cities of the east and west; but
      the most famous school was that of Berytus, 120 on the coast of
      Phœnicia; which flourished above three centuries from the time of
      Alexander Severus, the author perhaps of an institution so
      advantageous to his native country. After a regular course of
      education, which lasted five years, the students dispersed
      themselves through the provinces, in search of fortune and
      honors; nor could they want an inexhaustible supply of business
      in a great empire already corrupted by the multiplicity of laws,
      of arts, and of vices. The court of the Prætorian præfect of the
      east could alone furnish employment for one hundred and fifty
      advocates, sixty-four of whom were distinguished by peculiar
      privileges, and two were annually chosen, with a salary of sixty
      pounds of gold, to defend the causes of the treasury. The first
      experiment was made of their judicial talents, by appointing them
      to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates; from thence
      they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which
      they had pleaded. They obtained the government of a province;
      and, by the aid of merit, of reputation, or of favor, they
      ascended, by successive steps, to the _illustrious_ dignities of
      the state. 121 In the practice of the bar, these men had
      considered reason as the instrument of dispute; they interpreted
      the laws according to the dictates of private interest and the
      same pernicious habits might still adhere to their characters in
      the public administration of the state. The honor of a liberal
      profession has indeed been vindicated by ancient and modern
      advocates, who have filled the most important stations, with pure
      integrity and consummate wisdom: but in the decline of Roman
      jurisprudence, the ordinary promotion of lawyers was pregnant
      with mischief and disgrace. The noble art, which had once been
      preserved as the sacred inheritance of the patricians, was fallen
      into the hands of freedmen and plebeians, 122 who, with cunning
      rather than with skill, exercised a sordid and pernicious trade.
      Some of them procured admittance into families for the purpose of
      fomenting differences, of encouraging suits, and of preparing a
      harvest of gain for themselves or their brethren. Others, recluse
      in their chambers, maintained the dignity of legal professors, by
      furnishing a rich client with subtleties to confound the plainest
      truths, and with arguments to color the most unjustifiable
      pretensions. The splendid and popular class was composed of the
      advocates, who filled the Forum with the sound of their turgid
      and loquacious rhetoric. Careless of fame and of justice, they
      are described, for the most part, as ignorant and rapacious
      guides, who conducted their clients through a maze of expense, of
      delay, and of disappointment; from whence, after a tedious series
      of years, they were at length dismissed, when their patience and
      fortune were almost exhausted. 123

      some critics with the poet Manilius; see Fabricius Bibliothec.

      of the Grecian philosophy he was named Prætorian præfect of

      III. In the system of policy introduced by Augustus, the
      governors, those at least of the Imperial provinces, were
      invested with the full powers of the sovereign himself. Ministers
      of peace and war, the distribution of rewards and punishments
      depended on them alone, and they successively appeared on their
      tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy, and in complete armor
      at the head of the Roman legions. 124 The influence of the
      revenue, the authority of law, and the command of a military
      force, concurred to render their power supreme and absolute; and
      whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance, the loyal
      province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely
      sensible of any change in its political state. From the time of
      Commodus to the reign of Constantine, near one hundred governors
      might be enumerated, who, with various success, erected the
      standard of revolt; and though the innocent were too often
      sacrificed, the guilty might be sometimes prevented, by the
      suspicious cruelty of their master. 125 To secure his throne and
      the public tranquillity from these formidable servants,
      Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil
      administration, and to establish, as a permanent and professional
      distinction, a practice which had been adopted only as an
      occasional expedient. The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the
      Prætorian præfects over the armies of the empire, was transferred
      to the two _masters-general_ whom he instituted, the one for the
      _cavalry_, the other for the _infantry;_ and though each of these
      _illustrious_ officers was more peculiarly responsible for the
      discipline of those troops which were under his immediate
      inspection, they both indifferently commanded in the field the
      several bodies, whether of horse or foot, which were united in
      the same army. 126 Their number was soon doubled by the division
      of the east and west; and as separate generals of the same rank
      and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of the
      Rhine, of the Upper and the Lower Danube, and of the Euphrates,
      the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight
      masters-general of the cavalry and infantry. Under their orders,
      thirty-five military commanders were stationed in the provinces:
      three in Britain, six in Gaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five
      on the Upper, and four on the Lower Danube; in Asia, eight, three
      in Egypt, and four in Africa. The titles of _counts_, and
      _dukes_, 127 by which they were properly distinguished, have
      obtained in modern languages so very different a sense, that the
      use of them may occasion some surprise. But it should be
      recollected, that the second of those appellations is only a
      corruption of the Latin word, which was indiscriminately applied
      to any military chief. All these provincial generals were
      therefore _dukes;_ but no more than ten among them were dignified
      with the rank of _counts_ or companions, a title of honor, or
      rather of favor, which had been recently invented in the court of
      Constantine. A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the
      office of the counts and dukes; and besides their pay, they
      received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain one hundred
      and ninety servants, and one hundred and fifty-eight horses. They
      were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which
      related to the administration of justice or the revenue; but the
      command which they exercised over the troops of their department,
      was independent of the authority of the magistrates. About the
      same time that Constantine gave a legal sanction to the
      ecclesiastical order, he instituted in the Roman empire the nice
      balance of the civil and the military powers. The emulation, and
      sometimes the discord, which reigned between two professions of
      opposite interests and incompatible manners, was productive of
      beneficial and of pernicious consequences. It was seldom to be
      expected that the general and the civil governor of a province
      should either conspire for the disturbance, or should unite for
      the service, of their country. While the one delayed to offer the
      assistance which the other disdained to solicit, the troops very
      frequently remained without orders or without supplies; the
      public safety was betrayed, and the defenceless subjects were
      left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians. The divided
      administration which had been formed by Constantine, relaxed the
      vigor of the state, while it secured the tranquillity of the
      monarch.

      The memory of Constantine has been deservedly censured for
      another innovation, which corrupted military discipline and
      prepared the ruin of the empire. The nineteen years which
      preceded his final victory over Licinius, had been a period of
      license and intestine war. The rivals who contended for the
      possession of the Roman world, had withdrawn the greatest part of
      their forces from the guard of the general frontier; and the
      principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective
      dominions were filled with soldiers, who considered their
      countrymen as their most implacable enemies. After the use of
      these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war, the
      conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe
      discipline of Diocletian, and to suppress a fatal indulgence,
      which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military
      order. From the reign of Constantine, a popular and even legal
      distinction was admitted between the _Palatines_ 128 and the
      _Borderers;_ the troops of the court, as they were improperly
      styled, and the troops of the frontier. The former, elevated by
      the superiority of their pay and privileges, were permitted,
      except in the extraordinary emergencies of war, to occupy their
      tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces. The most
      flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of
      quarters. The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their
      profession, and contracted only the vices of civil life. They
      were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades, or
      enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres. They soon became
      careless of their martial exercises, curious in their diet and
      apparel; and while they inspired terror to the subjects of the
      empire, they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians.
      129 The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his
      colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers, was
      no longer maintained with the same care, or defended with the
      same vigilance. The numbers which still remained under the name
      of the troops of the frontier, might be sufficient for the
      ordinary defence; but their spirit was degraded by the
      humiliating reflection, that _they_ who were exposed to the
      hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare, were rewarded only
      with about two thirds of the pay and emoluments which were
      lavished on the troops of the court. Even the bands or legions
      that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy
      favorites, were in some measure disgraced by the title of honor
      which they were allowed to assume. It was in vain that
      Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword
      against the Borderers who should dare desert their colors, to
      connive at the inroads of the Barbarians, or to participate in
      the spoil. 130 The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels
      are seldom removed by the application of partial severities; and
      though succeeding princes labored to restore the strength and
      numbers of the frontier garrisons, the empire, till the last
      moment of its dissolution, continued to languish under the mortal
      wound which had been so rashly or so weakly inflicted by the hand
      of Constantine.

      The same timid policy, of dividing whatever is united, of
      reducing whatever is eminent, of dreading every active power, and
      of expecting that the most feeble will prove the most obedient,
      seems to pervade the institutions of several princes, and
      particularly those of Constantine. The martial pride of the
      legions, whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of
      rebellion, was nourished by the memory of their past exploits,
      and the consciousness of their actual strength. As long as they
      maintained their ancient establishment of six thousand men, they
      subsisted, under the reign of Diocletian, each of them singly, a
      visible and important object in the military history of the Roman
      empire. A few years afterwards, these gigantic bodies were shrunk
      to a very diminutive size; and when _seven_ legions, with some
      auxiliaries, defended the city of Amida against the Persians, the
      total garrison, with the inhabitants of both sexes, and the
      peasants of the deserted country, did not exceed the number of
      twenty thousand persons. 131 From this fact, and from similar
      examples, there is reason to believe, that the constitution of
      the legionary troops, to which they partly owed their valor and
      discipline, was dissolved by Constantine; and that the bands of
      Roman infantry, which still assumed the same names and the same
      honors, consisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men.
      132 The conspiracy of so many separate detachments, each of which
      was awed by the sense of its own weakness, could easily be
      checked; and the successors of Constantine might indulge their
      love of ostentation, by issuing their orders to one hundred and
      thirty-two legions, inscribed on the muster-roll of their
      numerous armies. The remainder of their troops was distributed
      into several hundred cohorts of infantry, and squadrons of
      cavalry. Their arms, and titles, and ensigns, were calculated to
      inspire terror, and to display the variety of nations who marched
      under the Imperial standard. And not a vestige was left of that
      severe simplicity, which, in the ages of freedom and victory, had
      distinguished the line of battle of a Roman army from the
      confused host of an Asiatic monarch. 133 A more particular
      enumeration, drawn from the_ Notitia_, might exercise the
      diligence of an antiquary; but the historian will content himself
      with observing, that the number of permanent stations or
      garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire, amounted to
      five hundred and eighty-three; and that, under the successors of
      Constantine, the complete force of the military establishment was
      computed at six hundred and forty-five thousand soldiers. 134 An
      effort so prodigious surpassed the wants of a more ancient, and
      the faculties of a later, period.

      In the various states of society, armies are recruited from very
      different motives. Barbarians are urged by the love of war; the
      citizens of a free republic may be prompted by a principle of
      duty; the subjects, or at least the nobles, of a monarchy, are
      animated by a sentiment of honor; but the timid and luxurious
      inhabitants of a declining empire must be allured into the
      service by the hopes of profit, or compelled by the dread of
      punishment. The resources of the Roman treasury were exhausted by
      the increase of pay, by the repetition of donatives, and by the
      invention of new emolument and indulgences, which, in the opinion
      of the provincial youth might compensate the hardships and
      dangers of a military life. Yet, although the stature was
      lowered, 135 although slaves, least by a tacit connivance, were
      indiscriminately received into the ranks, the insurmountable
      difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of
      volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and
      coercive methods. The lands bestowed on the veterans, as the free
      reward of their valor were henceforward granted under a condition
      which contain the first rudiments of the feudal tenures; that
      their sons, who succeeded to the inheritance, should devote
      themselves to the profession of arms, as soon as they attained
      the age of manhood; and their cowardly refusal was punished by
      the loss of honor, of fortune, or even of life. 136 But as the
      annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small
      proportion to the demands of the service, levies of men were
      frequently required from the provinces, and every proprietor was
      obliged either to take up arms, or to procure a substitute, or to
      purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine. The sum of
      forty-two pieces of gold, to which it was _reduced_ ascertains
      the exorbitant price of volunteers, and the reluctance with which
      the government admitted of this alternative. 137 Such was the
      horror for the profession of a soldier, which had affected the
      minds of the degenerate Romans, that many of the youth of Italy
      and the provinces chose to cut off the fingers of their right
      hand, to escape from being pressed into the service; and this
      strange expedient was so commonly practised, as to deserve the
      severe animadversion of the laws, 138 and a peculiar name in the
      Latin language. 139

      Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople.—Part V.


      The introduction of Barbarians into the Roman armies became every
      day more universal, more necessary, and more fatal. The most
      daring of the Scythians, of the Goths, and of the Germans, who
      delighted in war, and who found it more profitable to defend than
      to ravage the provinces, were enrolled, not only in the
      auxiliaries of their respective nations, but in the legions
      themselves, and among the most distinguished of the Palatine
      troops. As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire,
      they gradually learned to despise their manners, and to imitate
      their arts. They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride
      of Rome had exacted from their ignorance, while they acquired the
      knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she
      supported her declining greatness. The Barbarian soldiers, who
      displayed any military talents, were advanced, without exception,
      to the most important commands; and the names of the tribunes, of
      the counts and dukes, and of the generals themselves, betray a
      foreign origin, which they no longer condescended to disguise.
      They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their
      countrymen; and though most of them preferred the ties of
      allegiance to those of blood, they did not always avoid the
      guilt, or at least the suspicion, of holding a treasonable
      correspondence with the enemy, of inviting his invasion, or of
      sparing his retreat. The camps and the palace of the son of
      Constantine were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks,
      who preserved the strictest connection with each other, and with
      their country, and who resented every personal affront as a
      national indignity. 140 When the tyrant Caligula was suspected of
      an intention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the
      consular robes, the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely
      excited less astonishment, if, instead of a horse, the noblest
      chieftain of Germany or Britain had been the object of his
      choice. The revolution of three centuries had produced so
      remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people, that, with
      the public approbation, Constantine showed his successors the
      example of bestowing the honors of the consulship on the
      Barbarians, who, by their merit and services, had deserved to be
      ranked among the first of the Romans. 141 But as these hardy
      veterans, who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of
      the laws, were incapable of exercising any civil offices, the
      powers of the human mind were contracted by the irreconcilable
      separation of talents as well as of professions. The accomplished
      citizens of the Greek and Roman republics, whose characters could
      adapt themselves to the bar, the senate, the camp, or the
      schools, had learned to write, to speak, and to act with the same
      spirit, and with equal abilities.

      Barbarian. I should therefore interpret the liberality of that
      prince as relative to the ornaments rather than to the office, of
      the consulship.]

      IV. Besides the magistrates and generals, who at a distance from
      the court diffused their delegated authority over the provinces
      and armies, the emperor conferred the rank of _Illustrious_ on
      seven of his more immediate servants, to whose fidelity he
      intrusted his safety, or his counsels, or his treasures. 1. The
      private apartments of the palace were governed by a favorite
      eunuch, who, in the language of that age, was styled the
      _præpositus_, or præfect of the sacred bed-chamber. His duty was
      to attend the emperor in his hours of state, or in those of
      amusement, and to perform about his person all those menial
      services, which can only derive their splendor from the influence
      of royalty. Under a prince who deserved to reign, the great
      chamberlain (for such we may call him) was a useful and humble
      domestic; but an artful domestic, who improves every occasion of
      unguarded confidence, will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind
      that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can
      seldom obtain. The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius, who were
      invisible to their subjects, and contemptible to their enemies,
      exalted the præfects of their bed-chamber above the heads of all
      the ministers of the palace; 142 and even his deputy, the first
      of the splendid train of slaves who waited in the presence, was
      thought worthy to rank before the _respectable_ proconsuls of
      Greece or Asia. The jurisdiction of the chamberlain was
      acknowledged by the _counts_, or superintendents, who regulated
      the two important provinces of the magnificence of the wardrobe,
      and of the luxury of the Imperial table. 143 2. The principal
      administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence
      and abilities of the _master of the offices_. 144 He was the
      supreme magistrate of the palace, inspected the discipline of the
      civil and military _schools_, and received appeals from all parts
      of the empire, in the causes which related to that numerous army
      of privileged persons, who, as the servants of the court, had
      obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the
      authority of the ordinary judges. The correspondence between the
      prince and his subjects was managed by the four _scrinia_, or
      offices of this minister of state. The first was appropriated to
      memorials, the second to epistles, the third to petitions, and
      the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind. Each of
      these was directed by an _inferior_ master of _respectable_
      dignity, and the whole business was despatched by a hundred and
      forty-eight secretaries, chosen for the most part from the
      profession of the law, on account of the variety of abstracts of
      reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise
      of their several functions. From a condescension, which in former
      ages would have been esteemed unworthy the Roman majesty, a
      particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language; and
      interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the
      Barbarians; but the department of foreign affairs, which
      constitutes so essential a part of modern policy, seldom diverted
      the attention of the master of the offices. His mind was more
      seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and
      arsenals of the empire. There were thirty-four cities, fifteen in
      the East, and nineteen in the West, in which regular companies of
      workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armor,
      offensive weapons of all sorts, and military engines, which were
      deposited in the arsenals, and occasionally delivered for the
      service of the troops. 3. In the course of nine centuries, the
      office of _quæstor_ had experienced a very singular revolution.
      In the infancy of Rome, two inferior magistrates were annually
      elected by the people, to relieve the consuls from the invidious
      management of the public treasure; 145 a similar assistant was
      granted to every proconsul, and to every prætor, who exercised a
      military or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the
      two quæstors were gradually multiplied to the number of four, of
      eight, of twenty, and, for a short time, perhaps, of forty; 146
      and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which
      gave them a seat in the senate, and a just hope of obtaining the
      honors of the republic. Whilst Augustus affected to maintain the
      freedom of election, he consented to accept the annual privilege
      of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain
      proportion of candidates; and it was his custom to select one of
      these distinguished youths, to read his orations or epistles in
      the assemblies of the senate. 147 The practice of Augustus was
      imitated by succeeding princes; the occasional commission was
      established as a permanent office; and the favored quæstor,
      assuming a new and more illustrious character, alone survived the
      suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues. 148 As the
      orations which he composed in the name of the emperor, 149
      acquired the force, and, at length, the form, of absolute edicts,
      he was considered as the representative of the legislative power,
      the oracle of the council, and the original source of the civil
      jurisprudence. He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the
      supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory, with the Prætorian
      præfects, and the master of the offices; and he was frequently
      requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges: but as he was
      not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business, his leisure
      and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of
      eloquence, which, in the corruption of taste and language, still
      preserves the majesty of the Roman laws. 150 In some respects,
      the office of the Imperial quæstor may be compared with that of a
      modern chancellor; but the use of a great seal, which seems to
      have been adopted by the illiterate barbarians, was never
      introduced to attest the public acts of the emperors. 4. The
      extraordinary title of _count of the sacred largesses_ was
      bestowed on the treasurer-general of the revenue, with the
      intention perhaps of inculcating, that every payment flowed from
      the voluntary bounty of the monarch. To conceive the almost
      infinite detail of the annual and daily expense of the civil and
      military administration in every part of a great empire, would
      exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination.

      The actual account employed several hundred persons, distributed
      into eleven different offices, which were artfully contrived to
      examine and control their respective operations. The multitude of
      these agents had a natural tendency to increase; and it was more
      than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the
      useless supernumeraries, who, deserting their honest labors, had
      pressed with too much eagerness into the lucrative profession of
      the finances. 151 Twenty-nine provincial receivers, of whom
      eighteen were honored with the title of count, corresponded with
      the treasurer; and he extended his jurisdiction over the mines
      from whence the precious metals were extracted, over the mints,
      in which they were converted into the current coin, and over the
      public treasuries of the most important cities, where they were
      deposited for the service of the state. The foreign trade of the
      empire was regulated by this minister, who directed likewise all
      the linen and woollen manufactures, in which the successive
      operations of spinning, weaving, and dyeing were executed,
      chiefly by women of a servile condition, for the use of the
      palace and army. Twenty-six of these institutions are enumerated
      in the West, where the arts had been more recently introduced,
      and a still larger proportion may be allowed for the industrious
      provinces of the East. 152 5. Besides the public revenue, which
      an absolute monarch might levy and expend according to his
      pleasure, the emperors, in the capacity of opulent citizens,
      possessed a very extensive property, which was administered by
      the _count_ or treasurer of _the private estate_. Some part had
      perhaps been the ancient demesnes of kings and republics; some
      accessions might be derived from the families which were
      successively invested with the purple; but the most considerable
      portion flowed from the impure source of confiscations and
      forfeitures. The Imperial estates were scattered through the
      provinces, from Mauritania to Britain; but the rich and fertile
      soil of Cappadocia tempted the monarch to acquire in that country
      his fairest possessions, 153 and either Constantine or his
      successors embraced the occasion of justifying avarice by
      religious zeal. They suppressed the rich temple of Comana, where
      the high priest of the goddess of war supported the dignity of a
      sovereign prince; and they applied to their private use the
      consecrated lands, which were inhabited by six thousand subjects
      or slaves of the deity and her ministers. 154 But these were not
      the valuable inhabitants: the plains that stretch from the foot
      of Mount Argæus to the banks of the Sarus, bred a generous race
      of horses, renowned above all others in the ancient world for
      their majestic shape and incomparable swiftness. These _sacred_
      animals, destined for the service of the palace and the Imperial
      games, were protected by the laws from the profanation of a
      vulgar master. 155 The demesnes of Cappadocia were important
      enough to require the inspection of a count; 156 officers of an
      inferior rank were stationed in the other parts of the empire;
      and the deputies of the private, as well as those of the public,
      treasurer were maintained in the exercise of their independent
      functions, and encouraged to control the authority of the
      provincial magistrates. 157 6, 7. The chosen bands of cavalry and
      infantry, which guarded the person of the emperor, were under the
      immediate command of the _two counts of the domestics_. The whole
      number consisted of three thousand five hundred men, divided into
      seven _schools_, or troops, of five hundred each; and in the
      East, this honorable service was almost entirely appropriated to
      the Armenians. Whenever, on public ceremonies, they were drawn up
      in the courts and porticos of the palace, their lofty stature,
      silent order, and splendid arms of silver and gold, displayed a
      martial pomp not unworthy of the Roman majesty. 158 From the
      seven schools two companies of horse and foot were selected, of
      the _protectors_, whose advantageous station was the hope and
      reward of the most deserving soldiers. They mounted guard in the
      interior apartments, and were occasionally despatched into the
      provinces, to execute with celerity and vigor the orders of their
      master. 159 The counts of the domestics had succeeded to the
      office of the Prætorian præfects; like the præfects, they aspired
      from the service of the palace to the command of armies.

      The perpetual intercourse between the court and the provinces was
      facilitated by the construction of roads and the institution of
      posts. But these beneficial establishments were accidentally
      connected with a pernicious and intolerable abuse. Two or three
      hundred _agents_ or messengers were employed, under the
      jurisdiction of the master of the offices, to announce the names
      of the annual consuls, and the edicts or victories of the
      emperors. They insensibly assumed the license of reporting
      whatever they could observe of the conduct either of magistrates
      or of private citizens; and were soon considered as the eyes of
      the monarch, 160 and the scourge of the people. Under the warm
      influence of a feeble reign, they multiplied to the incredible
      number of ten thousand, disdained the mild though frequent
      admonitions of the laws, and exercised in the profitable
      management of the posts a rapacious and insolent oppression.
      These official spies, who regularly corresponded with the palace,
      were encouraged by favor and reward, anxiously to watch the
      progress of every treasonable design, from the faint and latent
      symptoms of disaffection, to the actual preparation of an open
      revolt. Their careless or criminal violation of truth and justice
      was covered by the consecrated mask of zeal; and they might
      securely aim their poisoned arrows at the breast either of the
      guilty or the innocent, who had provoked their resentment, or
      refused to purchase their silence. A faithful subject, of Syria
      perhaps, or of Britain, was exposed to the danger, or at least to
      the dread, of being dragged in chains to the court of Milan or
      Constantinople, to defend his life and fortune against the
      malicious charge of these privileged informers. The ordinary
      administration was conducted by those methods which extreme
      necessity can alone palliate; and the defects of evidence were
      diligently supplied by the use of torture. 161

      The deceitful and dangerous experiment of the criminal
      _quæstion_, as it is emphatically styled, was admitted, rather
      than approved, in the jurisprudence of the Romans. They applied
      this sanguinary mode of examination only to servile bodies, whose
      sufferings were seldom weighed by those haughty republicans in
      the scale of justice or humanity; but they would never consent to
      violate the sacred person of a citizen, till they possessed the
      clearest evidence of his guilt. 162 The annals of tyranny, from
      the reign of Tiberius to that of Domitian, circumstantially
      relate the executions of many innocent victims; but, as long as
      the faintest remembrance was kept alive of the national freedom
      and honor, the last hours of a Roman were secured from the danger
      of ignominions torture. 163 The conduct of the provincial
      magistrates was not, however, regulated by the practice of the
      city, or the strict maxims of the civilians. They found the use
      of torture established not only among the slaves of oriental
      despotism, but among the Macedonians, who obeyed a limited
      monarch; among the Rhodians, who flourished by the liberty of
      commerce; and even among the sage Athenians, who had asserted and
      adorned the dignity of human kind. 164 The acquiescence of the
      provincials encouraged their governors to acquire, or perhaps to
      usurp, a discretionary power of employing the rack, to extort
      from vagrants or plebeian criminals the confession of their
      guilt, till they insensibly proceeded to confound the distinction
      of rank, and to disregard the privileges of Roman citizens. The
      apprehensions of the subjects urged them to solicit, and the
      interest of the sovereign engaged him to grant, a variety of
      special exemptions, which tacitly allowed, and even authorized,
      the general use of torture. They protected all persons of
      illustrious or honorable rank, bishops and their presbyters,
      professors of the liberal arts, soldiers and their families,
      municipal officers, and their posterity to the third generation,
      and all children under the age of puberty. 165 But a fatal maxim
      was introduced into the new jurisprudence of the empire, that in
      the case of treason, which included every offence that the
      subtlety of lawyers could derive from a _hostile intention_
      towards the prince or republic, 166 all privileges were
      suspended, and all conditions were reduced to the same
      ignominious level. As the safety of the emperor was avowedly
      preferred to every consideration of justice or humanity, the
      dignity of age and the tenderness of youth were alike exposed to
      the most cruel tortures; and the terrors of a malicious
      information, which might select them as the accomplices, or even
      as the witnesses, perhaps, of an imaginary crime, perpetually
      hung over the heads of the principal citizens of the Roman world.

      These evils, however terrible they may appear, were confined to
      the smaller number of Roman subjects, whose dangerous situation
      was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those
      advantages, either of nature or of fortune, which exposed them to
      the jealousy of the monarch. The obscure millions of a great
      empire have much less to dread from the cruelty than from the
      avarice of their masters, and _their_ humble happiness is
      principally affected by the grievance of excessive taxes, which,
      gently pressing on the wealthy, descend with accelerated weight
      on the meaner and more indigent classes of society. An ingenious
      philosopher 168 has calculated the universal measure of the
      public impositions by the degrees of freedom and servitude; and
      ventures to assert, that, according to an invariable law of
      nature, it must always increase with the former, and diminish in
      a just proportion to the latter. But this reflection, which would
      tend to alleviate the miseries of despotism, is contradicted at
      least by the history of the Roman empire; which accuses the same
      princes of despoiling the senate of its authority, and the
      provinces of their wealth. Without abolishing all the various
      customs and duties on merchandises, which are imperceptibly
      discharged by the apparent choice of the purchaser, the policy of
      Constantine and his successors preferred a simple and direct mode
      of taxation, more congenial to the spirit of an arbitrary

      Chapter XVII: Foundation Of Constantinople.—Part VI.


      The name and use of the _indictions_, 170 which serve to
      ascertain the chronology of the middle ages, were derived from
      the regular practice of the Roman tributes. 171 The emperor
      subscribed with his own hand, and in purple ink, the solemn
      edict, or indiction, which was fixed up in the principal city of
      each diocese, during two months previous to the first day of
      September. And by a very easy connection of ideas, the word
      _indiction_ was transferred to the measure of tribute which it
      prescribed, and to the annual term which it allowed for the
      payment. This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned
      to the real and imaginary wants of the state; but as often as the
      expense exceeded the revenue, or the revenue fell short of the
      computation, an additional tax, under the name of
      _superindiction_, was imposed on the people, and the most
      valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the
      Prætorian præfects, who, on some occasions, were permitted to
      provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the
      public service. The execution of these laws (which it would be
      tedious to pursue in their minute and intricate detail) consisted
      of two distinct operations: the resolving the general imposition
      into its constituent parts, which were assessed on the provinces,
      the cities, and the individuals of the Roman world; and the
      collecting the separate contributions of the individuals, the
      cities, and the provinces, till the accumulated sums were poured
      into the Imperial treasuries. But as the account between the
      monarch and the subject was perpetually open, and as the renewal
      of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding
      obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the
      same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution. Whatever
      was honorable or important in the administration of the revenue,
      was committed to the wisdom of the præfects, and their provincia.
      representatives; the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd
      of subordinate officers, some of whom depended on the treasurer,
      others on the governor of the province; and who, in the
      inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction, had frequent
      opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the
      people. The laborious offices, which could be productive only of
      envy and reproach, of expense and danger, were imposed on the
      _Decurions_, who formed the corporations of the cities, and whom
      the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the
      burdens of civil society. 172 The whole landed property of the
      empire (without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch)
      was the object of ordinary taxation; and every new purchaser
      contracted the obligations of the former proprietor. An accurate
      _census_, 173 or survey, was the only equitable mode of
      ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged
      to contribute for the public service; and from the well-known
      period of the indictions, there is reason to believe that this
      difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular
      distance of fifteen years. The lands were measured by surveyors,
      who were sent into the provinces; their nature, whether arable or
      pasture, or vineyards or woods, was distinctly reported; and an
      estimate was made of their common value from the average produce
      of five years. The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an
      essential part of the report; an oath was administered to the
      proprietors, which bound them to disclose the true state of their
      affairs; and their attempts to prevaricate, or elude the
      intention of the legislator, were severely watched, and punished
      as a capital crime, which included the double guilt of treason
      and sacrilege. 174 A large portion of the tribute was paid in
      money; and of the current coin of the empire, gold alone could be
      legally accepted. 175 The remainder of the taxes, according to
      the proportions determined by the annual indiction, was furnished
      in a manner still more direct, and still more oppressive.
      According to the different nature of lands, their real produce in
      the various articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, wood or
      iron, was transported by the labor or at the expense of the
      provincials 17511 to the Imperial magazines, from whence they
      were occasionally distributed for the use of the court, of the
      army, and of two capitals, Rome and Constantinople. The
      commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make
      considerable purchases, that they were strictly prohibited from
      allowing any compensation, or from receiving in money the value
      of those supplies which were exacted in kind. In the primitive
      simplicity of small communities, this method may be well adapted
      to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people; but it
      is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude, and of the utmost
      strictness, which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must
      introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and
      the arts of fraud. 176 The agriculture of the Roman provinces was
      insensibly ruined, and, in the progress of despotism which tends
      to disappoint its own purpose, the emperors were obliged to
      derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts, or the remission
      of tributes, which their subjects were utterly incapable of
      paying. According to the new division of Italy, the fertile and
      happy province of Campania, the scene of the early victories and
      of the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome, extended
      between the sea and the Apennine, from the Tiber to the Silarus.
      Within sixty years after the death of Constantine, and on the
      evidence of an actual survey, an exemption was granted in favor
      of three hundred and thirty thousand English acres of desert and
      uncultivated land; which amounted to one eighth of the whole
      surface of the province. As the footsteps of the Barbarians had
      not yet been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing desolation,
      which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the
      administration of the Roman emperors. 177

      Either from design or from accident, the mode of assessment
      seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms of a
      capitation. 178 The returns which were sent of every province or
      district, expressed the number of tributary subjects, and the
      amount of the public impositions. The latter of these sums was
      divided by the former; and the estimate, that such a province
      contained so many _capita_, or heads of tribute; and that each
      _head_ was rated at such a price, was universally received, not
      only in the popular, but even in the legal computation. The value
      of a tributary head must have varied, according to many
      accidental, or at least fluctuating circumstances; but some
      knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact, the more
      important, since it relates to one of the richest provinces of
      the Roman empire, and which now flourishes as the most splendid
      of the European kingdoms. The rapacious ministers of Constantius
      had exhausted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-five pieces
      of gold for the annual tribute of every head. The humane policy
      of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces. 179 A
      moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of
      extraordinary oppression and of transient indulgence, may
      therefore be fixed at sixteen pieces of gold, or about nine
      pounds sterling, the common standard, perhaps, of the impositions
      of Gaul. 180 But this calculation, or rather, indeed, the facts
      from whence it is deduced, cannot fail of suggesting two
      difficulties to a thinking mind, who will be at once surprised by
      the _equality_, and by the _enormity_, of the capitation. An

      excellent discourse of Mr. Greaves on the Denarius, for the proof
      of the following principles; 1. That the ancient and modern Roman
      pound, containing 5256 grains of Troy weight, is about one
      twelfth lighter than the English pound, which is composed of 5760
      of the same grains. 2. That the pound of gold, which had once
      been divided into forty-eight _aurei_, was at this time coined
      into seventy-two smaller pieces of the same denomination. 3. That
      five of these aurei were the legal tender for a pound of silver,
      and that consequently the pound of gold was exchanged for
      fourteen pounds eight ounces of silver, according to the Roman,
      or about thirteen pounds according to the English weight. 4. That
      the English pound of silver is coined into sixty-two shillings.
      From these elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold, the
      usual method of reckoning large sums, at forty pounds sterling,
      and we may fix the currency of the _aureus_ at somewhat more than
      eleven shillings. * Note: See, likewise, a Dissertation of M.
      Letronne, “Considerations Génerales sur l’Evaluation des Monnaies
      Grecques et Romaines” Paris, 1817—M.]

      I. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable constitution of
      human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of
      property, the most numerous part of the community would be
      deprived of their subsistence, by the equal assessment of a tax
      from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue.
      Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation; but in
      the practice, this unjust equality was no longer felt, as the
      tribute was collected on the principle of a _real_, not of a
      _personal_ imposition. 18011 Several indigent citizens
      contributed to compose a single _head_, or share of taxation;
      while the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his fortune, alone
      represented several of those imaginary beings. In a poetical
      request, addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the
      Roman princes who reigned in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris
      personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the
      Geryon of the Grecian fables, and entreats the new Hercules that
      he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting
      off three of his heads. 181 The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded
      the customary wealth of a poet; but if he had pursued the
      allusion, he might have painted many of the Gallic nobles with
      the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading over the face of
      the country, and devouring the substance of a hundred families.
      II. The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds
      sterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be
      rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of
      the same country, as it is now governed by the absolute monarch
      of an industrious, wealthy, and affectionate people. The taxes of
      France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by flattery, beyond
      the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling, which ought
      perhaps to be shared among four and twenty millions of
      inhabitants. 182 Seven millions of these, in the capacity of
      fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the obligations
      of the remaining multitude of women and children; yet the equal
      proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above
      fifty shillings of our money, instead of a proportion almost four
      times as considerable, which was regularly imposed on their
      Gallic ancestors. The reason of this difference may be found, not
      so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver, as
      in the different state of society, in ancient Gaul and in modern
      France. In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of
      every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are levied
      on property or on consumption, may be fairly divided among the
      whole body of the nation. But the far greater part of the lands
      of ancient Gaul, as well as of the other provinces of the Roman
      world, were cultivated by slaves, or by peasants, whose dependent
      condition was a less rigid servitude. 183 In such a state the
      poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed
      the fruits of their labor; and as the rolls of tribute were
      filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the
      means of an honorable, or at least of a decent subsistence, the
      comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the
      high rate of their capitation. The truth of this assertion may be
      illustrated by the following example: The Ædui, one of the most
      powerful and civilized tribes or _cities_ of Gaul, occupied an
      extent of territory, which now contains about five hundred
      thousand inhabitants, in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun
      and Nevers; 184 and with the probable accession of those of
      Châlons and Maçon, 185 the population would amount to eight
      hundred thousand souls. In the time of Constantine, the territory
      of the Ædui afforded no more than twenty-five thousand _heads_ of
      capitation, of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince
      from the intolerable weight of tribute. 186 A just analogy would
      seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian, 187
      that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number
      of half a million; and if, in the ordinary administration of
      government, their annual payments may be computed at about four
      millions and a half of our money, it would appear, that although
      the share of each individual was four times as considerable, a
      fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the
      Imperial province of Gaul. The exactions of Constantius may be
      calculated at seven millions sterling, which were reduced to two
      millions by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian.

      on the taxation system of the Empire. Gibbon, according to M.
      Savigny, is mistaken in supposing that there was but one kind of
      capitation tax; there was a land tax, and a capitation tax,
      strictly so called. The land tax was, in its operation, a
      proprietor’s or landlord’s tax. But, besides this, there was a
      direct capitation tax on all who were not possessed of landed
      property. This tax dates from the time of the Roman conquests;
      its amount is not clearly known. Gradual exemptions released
      different persons and classes from this tax. One edict exempts
      painters. In Syria, all under twelve or fourteen, or above
      sixty-five, were exempted; at a later period, all under twenty,
      and all unmarried females; still later, all under twenty-five,
      widows and nuns, soldiers, veterani and clerici—whole dioceses,
      that of Thrace and Illyricum. Under Galerius and Licinius, the
      plebs urbana became exempt; though this, perhaps, was only an
      ordinance for the East. By degrees, however, the exemption was
      extended to all the inhabitants of towns; and as it was strictly
      capitatio plebeia, from which all possessors were exempted it
      fell at length altogether on the coloni and agricultural slaves.
      These were registered in the same cataster (capitastrum) with the
      land tax. It was paid by the proprietor, who raised it again from
      his coloni and laborers.—M.]

      9906 births; and we are assured, by an actual enumeration of the
      people, annually repeated from the year 1773 to the year 1776,
      that upon an average, Hainault contains 257,097 inhabitants. By
      the rules of fair analogy, we might infer, that the ordinary
      proportion of annual births to the whole people, is about 1 to
      26; and that the kingdom of France contains 24,151,868 persons of
      both sexes and of every age. If we content ourselves with the
      more moderate proportion of 1 to 25, the whole population will
      amount to 23,222,950. From the diligent researches of the French
      Government, (which are not unworthy of our own imitation,) we may
      hope to obtain a still greater degree of certainty on this
      important subject * Note: On no subject has so much valuable
      information been collected since the time of Gibbon, as the
      statistics of the different countries of Europe but much is still

      But this tax, or capitation, on the proprietors of land, would
      have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to
      escape. With the view of sharing that species of wealth which is
      derived from art or labor, and which exists in money or in
      merchandise, the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute
      on the trading part of their subjects. 188 Some exemptions, very
      strictly confined both in time and place, were allowed to the
      proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates.
      Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal
      arts: but every other branch of commercial industry was affected
      by the severity of the law. The honorable merchant of Alexandria,
      who imported the gems and spices of India for the use of the
      western world; the usurer, who derived from the interest of money
      a silent and ignominious profit; the ingenious manufacturer, the
      diligent mechanic, and even the most obscure retailer of a
      sequestered village, were obliged to admit the officers of the
      revenue into the partnership of their gain; and the sovereign of
      the Roman empire, who tolerated the profession, consented to
      share the infamous salary, of public prostitutes. 18811 As this
      general tax upon industry was collected every fourth year, it was
      styled the _Lustral Contribution:_ and the historian Zosimus 189
      laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by
      the tears and terrors of the citizens, who were often compelled
      by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and
      unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their property
      had been assessed. The testimony of Zosimus cannot indeed be
      justified from the charge of passion and prejudice; but, from the
      nature of this tribute it seems reasonable to conclude, that it
      was arbitrary in the distribution, and extremely rigorous in the
      mode of collecting. The secret wealth of commerce, and the
      precarious profits of art or labor, are susceptible only of a
      discretionary valuation, which is seldom disadvantageous to the
      interest of the treasury; and as the person of the trader
      supplies the want of a visible and permanent security, the
      payment of the imposition, which, in the case of a land tax, may
      be obtained by the seizure of property, can rarely be extorted by
      any other means than those of corporal punishments. The cruel
      treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state, is attested, and
      was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of Constantine, who,
      disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges, allots a spacious
      and airy prison for the place of their confinement. 190

      These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute
      authority of the monarch; but the occasional offerings of the
      _coronary gold_ still retained the name and semblance of popular
      consent. It was an ancient custom that the allies of the
      republic, who ascribed their safety or deliverance to the success
      of the Roman arms, and even the cities of Italy, who admired the
      virtues of their victorious general, adorned the pomp of his
      triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold, which after
      the ceremony were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter, to remain
      a lasting monument of his glory to future ages. The progress of
      zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number, and increased the
      size, of these popular donations; and the triumph of Cæsar was
      enriched with two thousand eight hundred and twenty-two massy
      crowns, whose weight amounted to twenty thousand four hundred and
      fourteen pounds of gold. This treasure was immediately melted
      down by the prudent dictator, who was satisfied that it would be
      more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods: his example
      was imitated by his successors; and the custom was introduced of
      exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable
      present of the current gold coin of the empire. 191 The
      spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty;
      and instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph, it
      was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of
      the monarchy, as often as the emperor condescended to announce
      his accession, his consulship, the birth of a son, the creation
      of a Cæsar, a victory over the Barbarians, or any other real or
      imaginary event which graced the annals of his reign. The
      peculiar free gift of the senate of Rome was fixed by custom at
      sixteen hundred pounds of gold, or about sixty-four thousand
      pounds sterling. The oppressed subjects celebrated their own
      felicity, that their sovereign should graciously consent to
      accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty and
      gratitude. 192

      A people elated by pride, or soured by discontent, are seldom
      qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation. The
      subjects of Constantine were incapable of discerning the decline
      of genius and manly virtue, which so far degraded them below the
      dignity of their ancestors; but they could feel and lament the
      rage of tyranny, the relaxation of discipline, and the increase
      of taxes. The impartial historian, who acknowledges the justice
      of their complaints, will observe some favorable circumstances
      which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition. The
      threatening tempest of Barbarians, which so soon subverted the
      foundations of Roman greatness, was still repelled, or suspended,
      on the frontiers. The arts of luxury and literature were
      cultivated, and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed, by
      the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe. The
      forms, the pomp, and the expense of the civil administration
      contributed to restrain the irregular license of the soldiers;
      and although the laws were violated by power, or perverted by
      subtlety, the sage principles of the Roman jurisprudence
      preserved a sense of order and equity, unknown to the despotic
      governments of the East. The rights of mankind might derive some
      protection from religion and philosophy; and the name of freedom,
      which could no longer alarm, might sometimes admonish, the
      successors of Augustus, that they did not reign over a nation of
      Slaves or Barbarians. 193

      The character of the prince who removed the seat of empire, and
      introduced such important changes into the civil and religious
      constitution of his country, has fixed the attention, and divided
      the opinions, of mankind. By the grateful zeal of the Christians,
      the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every
      attribute of a hero, and even of a saint; while the discontent of
      the vanquished party has compared Constantine to the most
      abhorred of those tyrants, who, by their vice and weakness,
      dishonored the Imperial purple. The same passions have in some
      degree been perpetuated to succeeding generations, and the
      character of Constantine is considered, even in the present age,
      as an object either of satire or of panegyric. By the impartial
      union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest
      admirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his
      most-implacable enemies, we might hope to delineate a just
      portrait of that extraordinary man, which the truth and candor of
      history should adopt without a blush. 1 But it would soon appear,
      that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colors, and to
      reconcile such inconsistent qualities, must produce a figure
      monstrous rather than human, unless it is viewed in its proper
      and distinct lights, by a careful separation of the different
      periods of the reign of Constantine.

      Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective.
      The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers, whose
      character or situation variously tempered the influence of their
      religious zeal.]

      The person, as well as the mind, of Constantine, had been
      enriched by nature with her choicest endowments. His stature was
      lofty, his countenance majestic, his deportment graceful; his
      strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise, and
      from his earliest youth, to a very advanced season of life, he
      preserved the vigor of his constitution by a strict adherence to
      the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance. He delighted in
      the social intercourse of familiar conversation; and though he
      might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less
      reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station,
      the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of
      all who approached him. The sincerity of his friendship has been
      suspected; yet he showed, on some occasions, that he was not
      incapable of a warm and lasting attachment. The disadvantage of
      an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just
      estimate of the value of learning; and the arts and sciences
      derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of
      Constantine. In the despatch of business, his diligence was
      indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almost
      continually exercised in reading, writing, or meditating, in
      giving audiences to ambassadors, and in examining the complaints
      of his subjects. Even those who censured the propriety of his
      measures were compelled to acknowledge, that he possessed
      magnanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the most
      arduous designs, without being checked either by the prejudices
      of education, or by the clamors of the multitude. In the field,
      he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whom he
      conducted with the talents of a consummate general; and to his
      abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may ascribe the signal
      victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of
      the republic. He loved glory as the reward, perhaps as the
      motive, of his labors. The boundless ambition, which, from the
      moment of his accepting the purple at York, appears as the ruling
      passion of his soul, may be justified by the dangers of his own
      situation, by the character of his rivals, by the consciousness
      of superior merit, and by the prospect that his success would
      enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire.
      In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius, he had engaged
      on his side the inclinations of the people, who compared the
      undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and
      justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the
      administration of Constantine. 2

      2 (return) [ The virtues of Constantine are collected for the
      most part from Eutropius and the younger Victor, two sincere
      pagans, who wrote after the extinction of his family. Even
      Zosimus, and the _Emperor_ Julian, acknowledge his personal
      courage and military achievements.]

      Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the Tyber, or even in the
      plains of Hadrianople, such is the character which, with a few
      exceptions, he might have transmitted to posterity. But the
      conclusion of his reign (according to the moderate and indeed
      tender sentence of a writer of the same age) degraded him from
      the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the
      Roman princes. 3 In the life of Augustus, we behold the tyrant of
      the republic, converted, almost by imperceptible degrees, into
      the father of his country, and of human kind. In that of
      Constantine, we may contemplate a hero, who had so long inspired
      his subjects with love, and his enemies with terror, degenerating
      into a cruel and dissolute monarch, corrupted by his fortune, or
      raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation. The
      general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years
      of his reign, was a period of apparent splendor rather than of
      real prosperity; and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by
      the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and
      prodigality. The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of
      Maxentius and Licinius, were lavishly consumed; the various
      innovations introduced by the conqueror, were attended with an
      increasing expense; the cost of his buildings, his court, and his
      festivals, required an immediate and plentiful supply; and the
      oppression of the people was the only fund which could support
      the magnificence of the sovereign. 4 His unworthy favorites,
      enriched by the boundless liberality of their master, usurped
      with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption. 5 A secret
      but universal decay was felt in every part of the public
      administration, and the emperor himself, though he still retained
      the obedience, gradually lost the esteem, of his subjects. The
      dress and manners, which, towards the decline of life, he chose
      to affect, served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind. The
      Asiatic pomp, which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian,
      assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of
      Constantine. He is represented with false hair of various colors,
      laboriously arranged by the skilful artists to the times; a
      diadem of a new and more expensive fashion; a profusion of gems
      and pearls, of collars and bracelets, and a variegated flowing
      robe of silk, most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold. In
      such apparel, scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of
      Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged
      monarch, and the simplicity of a Roman veteran. 6 A mind thus
      relaxed by prosperity and indulgence, was incapable of rising to
      that magnanimity which disdains suspicion, and dares to forgive.
      The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by
      the maxims of policy, as they are taught in the schools of
      tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the executions, or rather
      murders, which sullied the declining age of Constantine, will
      suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who
      could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice, and the
      feelings of nature, to the dictates either of his passions or of
      his interest.

      The same fortune which so invariably followed the standard of
      Constantine, seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his
      domestic life. Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the
      longest and most prosperous reigns, Augustus Trajan, and
      Diocletian, had been disappointed of posterity; and the frequent
      revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any Imperial
      family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple. But
      the royalty of the Flavian line, which had been first ennobled by
      the Gothic Claudius, descended through several generations; and
      Constantine himself derived from his royal father the hereditary
      honors which he transmitted to his children. The emperor had been
      twice married. Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his
      youthful attachment, 7 had left him only one son, who was called
      Crispus. By Fausta, the daughter of Maximian, he had three
      daughters, and three sons known by the kindred names of
      Constantine, Constantius, and Constans. The unambitious brothers
      of the great Constantine, Julius Constantius, Dalmatius, and
      Hannibalianus, 8 were permitted to enjoy the most honorable rank,
      and the most affluent fortune, that could be consistent with a
      private station. The youngest of the three lived without a name,
      and died without posterity. His two elder brothers obtained in
      marriage the daughters of wealthy senators, and propagated new
      branches of the Imperial race. Gallus and Julian afterwards
      became the most illustrious of the children of Julius
      Constantius, the _Patrician_. The two sons of Dalmatius, who had
      been decorated with the vain title of _Censor_, were named
      Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The two sisters of the great
      Constantine, Anastasia and Eutropia, were bestowed on Optatus and
      Nepotianus, two senators of noble birth and of consular dignity.
      His third sister, Constantia, was distinguished by her
      preëminence of greatness and of misery. She remained the widow of
      the vanquished Licinius; and it was by her entreaties, that an
      innocent boy, the offspring of their marriage, preserved, for
      some time, his life, the title of Cæsar, and a precarious hope of
      the succession. Besides the females, and the allies of the
      Flavian house, ten or twelve males, to whom the language of
      modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood,
      seemed, according to the order of their birth, to be destined
      either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine. But in
      less than thirty years, this numerous and increasing family was
      reduced to the persons of Constantius and Julian, who alone had
      survived a series of crimes and calamities, such as the tragic
      poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus.

      Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the presumptive heir
      of the empire, is represented by impartial historians as an
      amiable and accomplished youth. The care of his education, or at
      least of his studies, was intrusted to Lactantius, the most
      eloquent of the Christians; a preceptor admirably qualified to
      form the taste, and the excite the virtues, of his illustrious
      disciple. 9 At the age of seventeen, Crispus was invested with
      the title of Cæsar, and the administration of the Gallic
      provinces, where the inroads of the Germans gave him an early
      occasion of signalizing his military prowess. In the civil war
      which broke out soon afterwards, the father and son divided their
      powers; and this history has already celebrated the valor as well
      as conduct displayed by the latter, in forcing the straits of the
      Hellespont, so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of
      Lacinius. This naval victory contributed to determine the event
      of the war; and the names of Constantine and of Crispus were
      united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects; who
      loudly proclaimed, that the world had been subdued, and was now
      governed, by an emperor endowed with every virtue; and by his
      illustrious son, a prince beloved of Heaven, and the lively image
      of his father’s perfections. The public favor, which seldom
      accompanies old age, diffused its lustre over the youth of
      Crispus. He deserved the esteem, and he engaged the affections,
      of the court, the army, and the people. The experienced merit of
      a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with
      reluctance, and frequently denied with partial and discontented
      murmurs; while, from the opening virtues of his successor, they
      fondly conceive the most unbounded hopes of private as well as
      public felicity. 10

      This dangerous popularity soon excited the attention of
      Constantine, who, both as a father and as a king, was impatient
      of an equal. Instead of attempting to secure the allegiance of
      his son by the generous ties of confidence and gratitude, he
      resolved to prevent the mischiefs which might be apprehended from
      dissatisfied ambition. Crispus soon had reason to complain, that
      while his infant brother Constantius was sent, with the title of
      Cæsar, to reign over his peculiar department of the Gallic
      provinces, 11 _he_, a prince of mature years, who had performed
      such recent and signal services, instead of being raised to the
      superior rank of Augustus, was confined almost a prisoner to his
      father’s court; and exposed, without power or defence, to every
      calumny which the malice of his enemies could suggest. Under such
      painful circumstances, the royal youth might not always be able
      to compose his behavior, or suppress his discontent; and we may
      be assured, that he was encompassed by a train of indiscreet or
      perfidious followers, who assiduously studied to inflame, and who
      were perhaps instructed to betray, the unguarded warmth of his
      resentment. An edict of Constantine, published about this time,
      manifestly indicates his real or affected suspicions, that a
      secret conspiracy had been formed against his person and
      government. By all the allurements of honors and rewards, he
      invites informers of every degree to accuse without exception his
      magistrates or ministers, his friends or his most intimate
      favorites, protesting, with a solemn asseveration, that he
      himself will listen to the charge, that he himself will revenge
      his injuries; and concluding with a prayer, which discovers some
      apprehension of danger, that the providence of the Supreme Being
      may still continue to protect the safety of the emperor and of
      the empire. 12

      The informers, who complied with so liberal an invitation, were
      sufficiently versed in the arts of courts to select the friends
      and adherents of Crispus as the guilty persons; nor is there any
      reason to distrust the veracity of the emperor, who had promised
      an ample measure of revenge and punishment. The policy of
      Constantine maintained, however, the same appearances of regard
      and confidence towards a son, whom he began to consider as his
      most irreconcilable enemy. Medals were struck with the customary
      vows for the long and auspicious reign of the young Cæsar; 13 and
      as the people, who were not admitted into the secrets of the
      palace, still loved his virtues, and respected his dignity, a
      poet who solicits his recall from exile, adores with equal
      devotion the majesty of the father and that of the son. 14 The
      time was now arrived for celebrating the august ceremony of the
      twentieth year of the reign of Constantine; and the emperor, for
      that purpose, removed his court from Nicomedia to Rome, where the
      most splendid preparations had been made for his reception. Every
      eye, and every tongue, affected to express their sense of the
      general happiness, and the veil of ceremony and dissimulation was
      drawn for a while over the darkest designs of revenge and murder.
      15 In the midst of the festival, the unfortunate Crispus was
      apprehended by order of the emperor, who laid aside the
      tenderness of a father, without assuming the equity of a judge.
      The examination was short and private; 16 and as it was thought
      decent to conceal the fate of the young prince from the eyes of
      the Roman people, he was sent under a strong guard to Pola, in
      Istria, where, soon afterwards, he was put to death, either by
      the hand of the executioner, or by the more gentle operations of
      poison. 17 The Cæsar Licinius, a youth of amiable manners, was
      involved in the ruin of Crispus: 18 and the stern jealousy of
      Constantine was unmoved by the prayers and tears of his favorite
      sister, pleading for the life of a son, whose rank was his only
      crime, and whose loss she did not long survive. The story of
      these unhappy princes, the nature and evidence of their guilt,
      the forms of their trial, and the circumstances of their death,
      were buried in mysterious obscurity; and the courtly bishop, who
      has celebrated in an elaborate work the virtues and piety of his
      hero, observes a prudent silence on the subject of these tragic
      events. 19 Such haughty contempt for the opinion of mankind,
      whilst it imprints an indelible stain on the memory of
      Constantine, must remind us of the very different behavior of one
      of the greatest monarchs of the present age. The Czar Peter, in
      the full possession of despotic power, submitted to the judgment
      of Russia, of Europe, and of posterity, the reasons which had
      compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of a criminal, or at
      least of a degenerate son. 20

      The innocence of Crispus was so universally acknowledged, that
      the modern Greeks, who adore the memory of their founder, are
      reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide, which the common
      feelings of human nature forbade them to justify. They pretend,
      that as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of
      the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled,
      he published to the world his repentance and remorse; that he
      mourned forty days, during which he abstained from the use of the
      bath, and all the ordinary comforts of life; and that, for the
      lasting instruction of posterity, he erected a golden statue of
      Crispus, with this memorable inscription: To my son, whom I
      unjustly condemned. 21 A tale so moral and so interesting would
      deserve to be supported by less exceptionable authority; but if
      we consult the more ancient and authentic writers, they will
      inform us, that the repentance of Constantine was manifested only
      in acts of blood and revenge; and that he atoned for the murder
      of an innocent son, by the execution, perhaps, of a guilty wife.
      They ascribe the misfortunes of Crispus to the arts of his
      step-mother Fausta, whose implacable hatred, or whose
      disappointed love, renewed in the palace of Constantine the
      ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phædra. 22 Like the daughter
      of Minos, the daughter of Maximian accused her son-in-law of an
      incestuous attempt on the chastity of his father’s wife; and
      easily obtained, from the jealousy of the emperor, a sentence of
      death against a young prince, whom she considered with reason as
      the most formidable rival of her own children. But Helena, the
      aged mother of Constantine, lamented and revenged the untimely
      fate of her grandson Crispus; nor was it long before a real or
      pretended discovery was made, that Fausta herself entertained a
      criminal connection with a slave belonging to the Imperial
      stables. 23 Her condemnation and punishment were the instant
      consequences of the charge; and the adulteress was suffocated by
      the steam of a bath, which, for that purpose, had been heated to
      an extraordinary degree. 24 By some it will perhaps be thought,
      that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years, and the
      honor of their common offspring, the destined heirs of the
      throne, might have softened the obdurate heart of Constantine,
      and persuaded him to suffer his wife, however guilty she might
      appear, to expiate her offences in a solitary prison. But it
      seems a superfluous labor to weigh the propriety, unless we could
      ascertain the truth, of this singular event, which is attended
      with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity. Those who have
      attacked, and those who have defended, the character of
      Constantine, have alike disregarded two very remarkable passages
      of two orations pronounced under the succeeding reign. The former
      celebrates the virtues, the beauty, and the fortune of the
      empress Fausta, the daughter, wife, sister, and mother of so many
      princes. 25 The latter asserts, in explicit terms, that the
      mother of the younger Constantine, who was slain three years
      after his father’s death, survived to weep over the fate of her
      son. 26 Notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers
      of the Pagan as well as of the Christian religion, there may
      still remain some reason to believe, or at least to suspect, that
      Fausta escaped the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband.
      2611 The deaths of a son and a nephew, with the execution of a
      great number of respectable, and perhaps innocent friends, 27 who
      were involved in their fall, may be sufficient, however, to
      justify the discontent of the Roman people, and to explain the
      satirical verses affixed to the palace gate, comparing the
      splendid and bloody reigns of Constantine and Nero. 28

      Chapter XVIII: Character Of Constantine And His Sons.—Part II.


      By the death of Crispus, the inheritance of the empire seemed to
      devolve on the three sons of Fausta, who have been already
      mentioned under the names of Constantine, of Constantius, and of
      Constans. These young princes were successively invested with the
      title of Cæsar; and the dates of their promotion may be referred
      to the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth years of the reign
      of their father. 29 This conduct, though it tended to multiply
      the future masters of the Roman world, might be excused by the
      partiality of paternal affection; but it is not so easy to
      understand the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the
      safety both of his family and of his people, by the unnecessary
      elevation of his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The
      former was raised, by the title of Cæsar, to an equality with his
      cousins. In favor of the latter, Constantine invented the new and
      singular appellation of _Nobilissimus;_ 30 to which he annexed
      the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold. But of
      the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire,
      Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of King; a
      name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested, as the
      profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny. The use of such a
      title, even as it appears under the reign of Constantine, is a
      strange and unconnected fact, which can scarcely be admitted on
      the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers.

      The whole empire was deeply interested in the education of these
      five youths, the acknowledged successors of Constantine. The
      exercise of the body prepared them for the fatigues of war and
      the duties of active life. Those who occasionally mention the
      education or talents of Constantius, allow that he excelled in
      the gymnastic arts of leaping and running that he was a dexterous
      archer, a skilful horseman, and a master of all the different
      weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the
      infantry. 32 The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed, though
      not perhaps with equal success, to improve the minds of the sons
      and nephews of Constantine. 33 The most celebrated professors of
      the Christian faith, of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman
      jurisprudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who
      reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal
      youths in the science of government, and the knowledge of
      mankind. But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by
      adversity and experience. In the free intercourse of private
      life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had
      learned to command his own passions, to encounter those of his
      equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness
      on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His
      destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated
      in the imperial purple. Incessantly surrounded with a train of
      flatterers, they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury,
      and the expectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their
      rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from
      whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a
      smooth and uniform aspect. The indulgence of Constantine admitted
      them, at a very tender age, to share the administration of the
      empire; and they studied the art of reigning, at the expense of
      the people intrusted to their care. The younger Constantine was
      appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Constantius
      exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their father,
      for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East.
      Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to
      revere Constans, the third of his sons, as the representative of
      the great Constantine. He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier,
      to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and
      Greece. The city of Cæsarea was chosen for the residence of
      Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the
      Lesser Armenia, were destined to form the extent of his new
      kingdom. For each of these princes a suitable establishment was
      provided. A just proportion of guards, of legions, and of
      auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dignity and
      defence. The ministers and generals, who were placed about their
      persons, were such as Constantine could trust to assist, and even
      to control, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their
      delegated power. As they advanced in years and experience, the
      limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged: but the
      emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus; and
      while he showed the _Cæsars_ to the armies and provinces, he
      maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its
      supreme head. 34 The tranquillity of the last fourteen years of
      his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible
      insurrection of a camel-driver in the Island of Cyprus, 35 or by
      the active part which the policy of Constantine engaged him to
      assume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians.

      Among the different branches of the human race, the Sarmatians
      form a very remarkable shade; as they seem to unite the manners
      of the Asiatic barbarians with the figure and complexion of the
      ancient inhabitants of Europe. According to the various accidents
      of peace and war, of alliance or conquest, the Sarmatians were
      sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais; and they sometimes
      spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the
      Vistula and the Volga. 36 The care of their numerous flocks and
      herds, the pursuit of game, and the exercises of war, or rather
      of rapine, directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians. The
      movable camps or cities, the ordinary residence of their wives
      and children, consisted only of large wagons drawn by oxen, and
      covered in the form of tents. The military strength of the nation
      was composed of cavalry; and the custom of their warriors, to
      lead in their hand one or two spare horses, enabled them to
      advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence, which surprised
      the security, and eluded the pursuit, of a distant enemy. 37
      Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a
      sort of cuirass, which was capable of resisting a sword or
      javelin, though it was formed only of horses’ hoofs, cut into
      thin and polished slices, carefully laid over each other in the
      manner of scales or feathers, and strongly sewed upon an under
      garment of coarse linen. 38 The offensive arms of the Sarmatians
      were short daggers, long lances, and a weighty bow with a quiver
      of arrows. They were reduced to the necessity of employing
      fish-bones for the points of their weapons; but the custom of
      dipping them in a venomous liquor, that poisoned the wounds which
      they inflicted, is alone sufficient to prove the most savage
      manners, since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would
      have abhorred so cruel a practice, and a nation skilled in the
      arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource. 39
      Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of
      prey, their shaggy beards, uncombed locks, the furs with which
      they were covered from head to foot, and their fierce
      countenances, which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their
      minds, inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with
      horror and dismay.

      The use of poisoned arms, which has been spread over both worlds,
      never preserved a savage tribe from the arms of a disciplined
      enemy. The tender Ovid, after a youth spent in the enjoyment of
      fame and luxury, was condemned to a hopeless exile on the frozen
      banks of the Danube, where he was exposed, almost without
      defence, to the fury of these monsters of the desert, with whose
      stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be
      confounded. In his pathetic, but sometimes unmanly lamentations,
      40 he describes in the most lively colors the dress and manners,
      the arms and inroads, of the Getæ and Sarmatians, who were
      associated for the purposes of destruction; and from the accounts
      of history there is some reason to believe that these Sarmatians
      were the Jazygæ, one of the most numerous and warlike tribes of
      the nation. The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a
      permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire. Soon
      after the reign of Augustus, they obliged the Dacians, who
      subsisted by fishing on the banks of the River Teyss or Tibiscus,
      to retire into the hilly country, and to abandon to the
      victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary,
      which are bounded by the course of the Danube and the
      semicircular enclosure of the Carpathian Mountains. 41 In this
      advantageous position, they watched or suspended the moment of
      attack, as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by
      presents; they gradually acquired the skill of using more
      dangerous weapons, and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate
      their name by any memorable exploits, they occasionally assisted
      their eastern and western neighbors, the Goths and the Germans,
      with a formidable body of cavalry. They lived under the irregular
      aristocracy of their chieftains: 42 but after they had received
      into their bosom the fugitive Vandals, who yielded to the
      pressure of the Gothic power, they seem to have chosen a king
      from that nation, and from the illustrious race of the Astingi,
      who had formerly dwelt on the hores of the northern ocean. 43

      43 (return) [ This hypothesis of a Vandal king reigning over
      Sarmatian subjects, seems necessary to reconcile the Goth
      Jornandes with the Greek and Latin historians of Constantine. It
      may be observed that Isidore, who lived in Spain under the
      dominion of the Goths, gives them for enemies, not the Vandals,
      but the Sarmatians. See his Chronicle in Grotius, p. 709. Note: I
      have already noticed the confusion which must necessarily arise
      in history, when names purely _geographical_, as this of
      Sarmatia, are taken for _historical_ names belonging to a single
      nation. We perceive it here; it has forced Gibbon to suppose,
      without any reason but the necessity of extricating himself from
      his perplexity, that the Sarmatians had taken a king from among
      the Vandals; a supposition entirely contrary to the usages of
      Barbarians Dacia, at this period, was occupied, not by
      Sarmatians, who have never formed a distinct race, but by
      Vandals, whom the ancients have often confounded under the
      general term Sarmatians. See Gatterer’s Welt-Geschiehte p.
      464—G.]

      This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of
      contention, which perpetually arise on the confines of warlike
      and independent nations. The Vandal princes were stimulated by
      fear and revenge; the Gothic kings aspired to extend their
      dominion from the Euxine to the frontiers of Germany; and the
      waters of the Maros, a small river which falls into the Teyss,
      were stained with the blood of the contending Barbarians. After
      some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their
      adversaries, the Sarmatians implored the protection of the Roman
      monarch, who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations, but
      who was justly alarmed by the progress of the Gothic arms. As
      soon as Constantine had declared himself in favor of the weaker
      party, the haughty Araric, king of the Goths, instead of
      expecting the attack of the legions, boldly passed the Danube,
      and spread terror and devastation through the province of Mæsia.

      To oppose the inroad of this destroying host, the aged emperor
      took the field in person; but on this occasion either his conduct
      or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so
      many foreign and domestic wars. He had the mortification of
      seeing his troops fly before an inconsiderable detachment of the
      Barbarians, who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp,
      and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and
      ignominious retreat. 4311 The event of a second and more
      successful action retrieved the honor of the Roman name; and the
      powers of art and discipline prevailed, after an obstinate
      contest, over the efforts of irregular valor. The broken army of
      the Goths abandoned the field of battle, the wasted province, and
      the passage of the Danube: and although the eldest of the sons of
      Constantine was permitted to supply the place of his father, the
      merit of the victory, which diffused universal joy, was ascribed
      to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself.

      4311 (return) [ Gibbon states, that Constantine was defeated by
      the Goths in a first battle. No ancient author mentions such an
      event. It is, no doubt, a mistake in Gibbon. St Martin, note to
      Le Beau. i. 324.—M.]

      He contributed at least to improve this advantage, by his
      negotiations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus, 44
      whose capital, situate on the western coast of the Tauric or
      Crimæan peninsula, still retained some vestiges of a Grecian
      colony, and was governed by a perpetual magistrate, assisted by a
      council of senators, emphatically styled the Fathers of the City.

      The Chersonites were animated against the Goths, by the memory of
      the wars, which, in the preceding century, they had maintained
      with unequal forces against the invaders of their country. They
      were connected with the Romans by the mutual benefits of
      commerce; as they were supplied from the provinces of Asia with
      corn and manufactures, which they purchased with their only
      productions, salt, wax, and hides. Obedient to the requisition of
      Constantine, they prepared, under the conduct of their magistrate
      Diogenes, a considerable army, of which the principal strength
      consisted in cross-bows and military chariots. The speedy march
      and intrepid attack of the Chersonites, by diverting the
      attention of the Goths, assisted the operations of the Imperial
      generals. The Goths, vanquished on every side, were driven into
      the mountains, where, in the course of a severe campaign, above a
      hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and
      hunger. Peace was at length granted to their humble
      supplications; the eldest son of Araric was accepted as the most
      valuable hostage; and Constantine endeavored to convince their
      chiefs, by a liberal distribution of honors and rewards, how far
      the friendship of the Romans was preferable to their enmity. In
      the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful
      Chersonites, the emperor was still more magnificent. The pride of
      the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal
      decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors. A
      perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their
      vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea. A regular
      subsidy was promised, of iron, corn, oil, and of every supply
      which could be useful either in peace or war. But it was thought
      that the Sarmatians were sufficiently rewarded by their
      deliverance from impending ruin; and the emperor, perhaps with
      too strict an economy, deducted some part of the expenses of the
      war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that
      turbulent nation.

      44 (return) [ I may stand in need of some apology for having
      used, without scruple, the authority of Constantine
      Porphyrogenitus, in all that relates to the wars and negotiations
      of the Chersonites. I am aware that he was a Greek of the tenth
      century, and that his accounts of ancient history are frequently
      confused and fabulous. But on this occasion his narrative is, for
      the most part, consistent and probable nor is there much
      difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have access to
      some secret archives, which had escaped the diligence of meaner
      historians. For the situation and history of Chersone, see
      Peyssonel, des Peuples barbares qui ont habite les Bords du
      Danube, c. xvi. 84-90. ——Gibbon has confounded the inhabitants of
      the city of Cherson, the ancient Chersonesus, with the people of
      the Chersonesus Taurica. If he had read with more attention the
      chapter of Constantius Porphyrogenitus, from which this narrative
      is derived, he would have seen that the author clearly
      distinguishes the republic of Cherson from the rest of the Tauric
      Peninsula, then possessed by the kings of the Cimmerian
      Bosphorus, and that the city of Cherson alone furnished succors
      to the Romans. The English historian is also mistaken in saying
      that the Stephanephoros of the Chersonites was a perpetual
      magistrate; since it is easy to discover from the great number of
      Stephanephoroi mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, that
      they were annual magistrates, like almost all those which
      governed the Grecian republics. St. Martin, note to Le Beau i.
      326.—M.]

      Exasperated by this apparent neglect, the Sarmatians soon forgot,
      with the levity of barbarians, the services which they had so
      lately received, and the dangers which still threatened their
      safety. Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the
      indignation of Constantine to leave them to their fate; and he no
      longer opposed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who
      had recently ascended the Gothic throne. Wisumar, the Vandal
      king, whilst alone, and unassisted, he defended his dominions
      with undaunted courage, was vanquished and slain in a decisive
      battle, which swept away the flower of the Sarmatian youth. 4411
      The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of
      arming their slaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by
      whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the
      invader from their confines. But they soon discovered that they
      had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy, more dangerous and
      more implacable. Enraged by their former servitude, elated by
      their present glory, the slaves, under the name of Limigantes,
      claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had
      saved. Their masters, unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of
      the populace, preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of
      their servants. Some of the fugitive Sarmatians solicited a less
      ignominious dependence, under the hostile standard of the Goths.
      A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian Mountains,
      among the Quadi, their German allies, and were easily admitted to
      share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land. But the far
      greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards
      the fruitful provinces of Rome. Imploring the protection and
      forgiveness of the emperor, they solemnly promised, as subjects
      in peace, and as soldiers in war, the most inviolable fidelity to
      the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom.
      According to the maxims adopted by Probus and his successors, the
      offers of this barbarian colony were eagerly accepted; and a
      competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace,
      Macedonia, and Italy, were immediately assigned for the
      habitation and subsistence of three hundred thousand Sarmatians.

      By chastising the pride of the Goths, and by accepting the homage
      of a suppliant nation, Constantine asserted the majesty of the
      Roman empire; and the ambassadors of Æthiopia, Persia, and the
      most remote countries of India, congratulated the peace and
      prosperity of his government. 46 If he reckoned, among the favors
      of fortune, the death of his eldest son, of his nephew, and
      perhaps of his wife, he enjoyed an uninterrupted flow of private
      as well as public felicity, till the thirtieth year of his reign;
      a period which none of his predecessors, since Augustus, had been
      permitted to celebrate. Constantine survived that solemn festival
      about ten months; and at the mature age of sixty-four, after a
      short illness, he ended his memorable life at the palace of
      Aquyrion, in the suburbs of Nicomedia, whither he had retired for
      the benefit of the air, and with the hope of recruiting his
      exhausted strength by the use of the warm baths. The excessive
      demonstrations of grief, or at least of mourning, surpassed
      whatever had been practised on any former occasion.
      Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient
      Rome, the corpse of the deceased emperor, according to his last
      request, was transported to the city, which was destined to
      preserve the name and memory of its founder. The body of
      Constantine adorned with the vain symbols of greatness, the
      purple and diadem, was deposited on a golden bed in one of the
      apartments of the palace, which for that purpose had been
      splendidly furnished and illuminated. The forms of the court were
      strictly maintained. Every day, at the appointed hours, the
      principal officers of the state, the army, and the household,
      approaching the person of their sovereign with bended knees and a
      composed countenance, offered their respectful homage as
      seriously as if he had been still alive. From motives of policy,
      this theatrical representation was for some time continued; nor
      could flattery neglect the opportunity of remarking that
      Constantine alone, by the peculiar indulgence of Heaven, had
      reigned after his death. 47

      But this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry; and it was
      soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is
      seldom obeyed, when his subjects have no longer anything to hope
      from his favor, or to dread from his resentment. The same
      ministers and generals, who bowed with such referential awe
      before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign, were
      engaged in secret consultations to exclude his two nephews,
      Dalmatius and Hannibalianus, from the share which he had assigned
      them in the succession of the empire. We are too imperfectly
      acquainted with the court of Constantine to form any judgment of
      the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy;
      unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of
      jealousy and revenge against the præfect Ablavius, a proud
      favorite, who had long directed the counsels and abused the
      confidence of the late emperor. The arguments, by which they
      solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people, are of a
      more obvious nature; and they might with decency, as well as
      truth, insist on the superior rank of the children of
      Constantine, the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns,
      and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic, from
      the discord of so many rival princes, who were not connected by
      the tender sympathy of fraternal affection. The intrigue was
      conducted with zeal and secrecy, till a loud and unanimous
      declaration was procured from the troops, that they would suffer
      none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the
      Roman empire. 48 The younger Dalmatius, who was united with his
      collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest, is
      allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities
      of the great Constantine; but, on this occasion, he does not
      appear to have concerted any measure for supporting, by arms, the
      just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the
      liberality of their uncle. Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide
      of popular fury, they seem to have remained, without the power of
      flight or of resistance, in the hands of their implacable
      enemies. Their fate was suspended till the arrival of
      Constantius, the second, and perhaps the most favored, of the
      sons of Constantine. 49

      Chapter XVIII: Character Of Constantine And His Sons.—Part III.


      The voice of the dying emperor had recommended the care of his
      funeral to the piety of Constantius; and that prince, by the
      vicinity of his eastern station, could easily prevent the
      diligence of his brothers, who resided in their distant
      government of Italy and Gaul. As soon as he had taken possession
      of the palace of Constantinople, his first care was to remove the
      apprehensions of his kinsmen, by a solemn oath which he pledged
      for their security. His next employment was to find some specious
      pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation
      of an imprudent promise. The arts of fraud were made subservient
      to the designs of cruelty; and a manifest forgery was attested by
      a person of the most sacred character. From the hands of the
      Bishop of Nicomedia, Constantius received a fatal scroll,
      affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father; in which the
      emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his
      brothers; and conjured his sons to revenge his death, and to
      consult their own safety, by the punishment of the guilty. 50
      Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate
      princes to defend their life and honor against so incredible an
      accusation, they were silenced by the furious clamors of the
      soldiers, who declared themselves, at once, their enemies, their
      judges, and their executioners. The spirit, and even the forms of
      legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous
      massacre; which involved the two uncles of Constantius, seven of
      his cousins, of whom Dalmatius and Hannibalianus were the most
      illustrious, the Patrician Optatus, who had married a sister of
      the late emperor, and the Præfect Ablavius, whose power and
      riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple.
      If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody
      scene, we might add, that Constantius himself had espoused the
      daughter of his uncle Julius, and that he had bestowed his sister
      in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus. These alliances, which
      the policy of Constantine, regardless of the public prejudice, 51
      had formed between the several branches of the Imperial house,
      served only to convince mankind, that these princes were as cold
      to the endearments of conjugal affection, as they were insensible
      to the ties of consanguinity, and the moving entreaties of youth
      and innocence. Of so numerous a family, Gallus and Julian alone,
      the two youngest children of Julius Constantius, were saved from
      the hands of the assassins, till their rage, satiated with
      slaughter, had in some measure subsided. The emperor Constantius,
      who, in the absence of his brothers, was the most obnoxious to
      guilt and reproach, discovered, on some future occasions, a faint
      and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious
      counsels of his ministers, and the irresistible violence of the
      troops, had extorted from his unexperienced youth. 52

      with contempt, as soon as it served their immediate purpose.

      had taken for the security of his kinsmen. ——The authority of

      obtained, with a certain preëminence of rank, the possession of
      the new capital, which bore his own name and that of his father.
      Thrace, and the countries of the East, were allotted for the
      patrimony of Constantius; and Constans was acknowledged as the
      lawful sovereign of Italy, Africa, and the Western Illyricum. The
      armies submitted to their hereditary right; and they
      condescended, after some delay, to accept from the Roman senate
      the title of _Augustus_. When they first assumed the reins of
      government, the eldest of these princes was twenty-one, the
      second twenty, and the third only seventeen, years of age. 53

      While the martial nations of Europe followed the standards of his
      brothers, Constantius, at the head of the effeminate troops of
      Asia, was left to sustain the weight of the Persian war. At the
      decease of Constantine, the throne of the East was filled by
      Sapor, son of Hormouz, or Hormisdas, and grandson of Narses, who,
      after the victory of Galerius, had humbly confessed the
      superiority of the Roman power. Although Sapor was in the
      thirtieth year of his long reign, he was still in the vigor of
      youth, as the date of his accession, by a very strange fatality,
      had preceded that of his birth. The wife of Hormouz remained
      pregnant at the time of her husband’s death; and the uncertainty
      of the sex, as well as of the event, excited the ambitious hopes
      of the princes of the house of Sassan. The apprehensions of civil
      war were at length removed, by the positive assurance of the
      Magi, that the widow of Hormouz had conceived, and would safely
      produce a son. Obedient to the voice of superstition, the
      Persians prepared, without delay, the ceremony of his coronation.

      A royal bed, on which the queen lay in state, was exhibited in
      the midst of the palace; the diadem was placed on the spot, which
      might be supposed to conceal the future heir of Artaxerxes, and
      the prostrate satraps adored the majesty of their invisible and
      insensible sovereign. 54 If any credit can be given to this
      marvellous tale, which seems, however, to be countenanced by the
      manners of the people, and by the extraordinary duration of his
      reign, we must admire not only the fortune, but the genius, of
      Sapor. In the soft, sequestered education of a Persian harem, the
      royal youth could discover the importance of exercising the vigor
      of his mind and body; and, by his personal merit, deserved a
      throne, on which he had been seated, while he was yet unconscious
      of the duties and temptations of absolute power. His minority was
      exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord;
      his capital was surprised and plundered by Thair, a powerful king
      of Yemen, or Arabia; and the majesty of the royal family was
      degraded by the captivity of a princess, the sister of the
      deceased king. But as soon as Sapor attained the age of manhood,
      the presumptuous Thair, his nation, and his country, fell beneath
      the first effort of the young warrior; who used his victory with
      so judicious a mixture of rigor and clemency, that he obtained
      from the fears and gratitude of the Arabs the title of
      _Dhoulacnaf_, or protector of the nation. 55 5511

      The ambition of the Persian, to whom his enemies ascribe the
      virtues of a soldier and a statesman, was animated by the desire
      of revenging the disgrace of his fathers, and of wresting from
      the hands of the Romans the five provinces beyond the Tigris. The
      military fame of Constantine, and the real or apparent strength
      of his government, suspended the attack; and while the hostile
      conduct of Sapor provoked the resentment, his artful negotiations
      amused the patience of the Imperial court. The death of
      Constantine was the signal of war, 56 and the actual condition of
      the Syrian and Armenian frontier seemed to encourage the Persians
      by the prospect of a rich spoil and an easy conquest. The example
      of the massacres of the palace diffused a spirit of
      licentiousness and sedition among the troops of the East, who
      were no longer restrained by their habits of obedience to a
      veteran commander. By the prudence of Constantius, who, from the
      interview with his brothers in Pannonia, immediately hastened to
      the banks of the Euphrates, the legions were gradually restored
      to a sense of duty and discipline; but the season of anarchy had
      permitted Sapor to form the siege of Nisibis, and to occupy
      several of the mo st important fortresses of Mesopotamia. 57 In
      Armenia, the renowned Tiridates had long enjoyed the peace and
      glory which he deserved by his valor and fidelity to the cause of
      Rome. 5711 The firm alliance which he maintained with Constantine
      was productive of spiritual as well as of temporal benefits; by
      the conversion of Tiridates, the character of a saint was applied
      to that of a hero, the Christian faith was preached and
      established from the Euphrates to the shores of the Caspian, and
      Armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy
      and religion. But as many of the Armenian nobles still refused to
      abandon the plurality of their gods and of their wives, the
      public tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction,
      which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign, and impatiently
      expected the hour of his death. He died at length after a reign
      of fifty-six years, and the fortune of the Armenian monarchy
      expired with Tiridates. His lawful heir was driven into exile,
      the Christian priests were either murdered or expelled from their
      churches, the barbarous tribes of Albania were solicited to
      descend from their mountains; and two of the most powerful
      governors, usurping the ensigns or the powers of royalty,
      implored the assistance of Sapor, and opened the gates of their
      cities to the Persian garrisons. The Christian party, under the
      guidance of the Archbishop of Artaxata, the immediate successor
      of St. Gregory the Illuminator, had recourse to the piety of
      Constantius. After the troubles had continued about three years,
      Antiochus, one of the officers of the household, executed with
      success the Imperial commission of restoring Chosroes, 5712 the
      son of Tiridates, to the throne of his fathers, of distributing
      honors and rewards among the faithful servants of the house of
      Arsaces, and of proclaiming a general amnesty, which was accepted
      by the greater part of the rebellious satraps. But the Romans
      derived more honor than advantage from this revolution. Chosroes
      was a prince of a puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit.
      Unequal to the fatigues of war, averse to the society of mankind,
      he withdrew from his capital to a retired palace, which he built
      on the banks of the River Eleutherus, and in the centre of a
      shady grove; where he consumed his vacant hours in the rural
      sports of hunting and hawking. To secure this inglorious ease, he
      submitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condescended to
      impose; the payment of an annual tribute, and the restitution of
      the fertile province of Atropatene, which the courage of
      Tiridates, and the victorious arms of Galerius, had annexed to
      the Armenian monarchy. 58 5811

      power of the Persians by the treachery of his chamberlain and the
      Persian governor of Atropatene or Aderbidjan. He was blinded: his
      wife and his son Arsaces shared his captivity, but the princes
      and nobles of Armenia claimed the protection of Rome; and this
      was the cause of Constantine’s declaration of war against the
      Persians.—The king of Persia attempted to make himself master of
      Armenia; but the brave resistance of the people, the advance of
      Constantius, and a defeat which his army suffered at Oskha in
      Armenia, and the failure before Nisibis, forced Shahpour to
      submit to terms of peace. Varaz-Shahpour, the perfidious governor
      of Atropatene, was flayed alive; Diran and his son were released
      from captivity; Diran refused to ascend the throne, and retired
      to an obscure retreat: his son Arsaces was crowned king of
      Armenia. Arsaces pursued a vacillating policy between the
      influence of Rome and Persia, and the war recommenced in the year

      Constantius to the East. See St. Martin, additions to Le Beau, i.

      During the long period of the reign of Constantius, the provinces
      of the East were afflicted by the calamities of the Persian war.
      5813 The irregular incursions of the light troops alternately
      spread terror and devastation beyond the Tigris and beyond the
      Euphrates, from the gates of Ctesiphon to those of Antioch; and
      this active service was performed by the Arabs of the desert, who
      were divided in their interest and affections; some of their
      independent chiefs being enlisted in the party of Sapor, whilst
      others had engaged their doubtful fidelity to the emperor. 59 The
      more grave and important operations of the war were conducted
      with equal vigor; and the armies of Rome and Persia encountered
      each other in nine bloody fields, in two of which Constantius
      himself commanded in person. 60 The event of the day was most
      commonly adverse to the Romans, but in the battle of Singara,
      their imprudent valor had almost achieved a signal and decisive
      victory. The stationary troops of Singara 6011 retired on the
      approach of Sapor, who passed the Tigris over three bridges, and
      occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp, which,
      by the labor of his numerous pioneers, he surrounded in one day
      with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart. His formidable host, when
      it was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the
      river, the adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of
      above twelve miles, which separated the two armies. Both were
      alike impatient to engage; but the Barbarians, after a slight
      resistance, fled in disorder; unable to resist, or desirous to
      weary, the strength of the heavy legions, who, fainting with heat
      and thirst, pursued them across the plain, and cut in pieces a
      line of cavalry, clothed in complete armor, which had been posted
      before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat.
      Constantius, who was hurried along in the pursuit, attempted,
      without effect, to restrain the ardor of his troops, by
      representing to them the dangers of the approaching night, and
      the certainty of completing their success with the return of day.
      As they depended much more on their own valor than on the
      experience or the abilities of their chief, they silenced by
      their clamors his timid remonstrances; and rushing with fury to
      the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and
      dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted
      strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labors. But the
      prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of
      which the greater part, securely posted on the heights, had been
      spectators of the action, advanced in silence, and under the
      shadow of the night; and his Persian archers, guided by the
      illumination of the camp, poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed
      and licentious crowd. The sincerity of history 61 declares, that
      the Romans were vanquished with a dreadful slaughter, and that
      the flying remnant of the legions was exposed to the most
      intolerable hardships. Even the tenderness of panegyric,
      confessing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by the
      disobedience of his soldiers, chooses to draw a veil over the
      circumstances of this melancholy retreat. Yet one of those venal
      orators, so jealous of the fame of Constantius, relates, with
      amazing coolness, an act of such incredible cruelty, as, in the
      judgment of posterity, must imprint a far deeper stain on the
      honor of the Imperial name. The son of Sapor, the heir of his
      crown, had been made a captive in the Persian camp. The unhappy
      youth, who might have excited the compassion of the most savage
      enemy, was scourged, tortured, and publicly executed by the
      inhuman Romans. 62

      Whatever advantages might attend the arms of Sapor in the field,
      though nine repeated victories diffused among the nations the
      fame of his valor and conduct, he could not hope to succeed in
      the execution of his designs, while the fortified towns of
      Mesopotamia, and, above all, the strong and ancient city of
      Nisibis, remained in the possession of the Romans. In the space
      of twelve years, Nisibis, which, since the time of Lucullus, had
      been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the East, sustained three
      memorable sieges against the power of Sapor; and the disappointed
      monarch, after urging his attacks above sixty, eighty, and a
      hundred days, was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy. 63 This
      large and populous city was situate about two days’ journey from
      the Tigris, in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the
      foot of Mount Masius. A treble enclosure of brick walls was
      defended by a deep ditch; 64 and the intrepid resistance of Count
      Lucilianus, and his garrison, was seconded by the desperate
      courage of the people. The citizens of Nisibis were animated by
      the exhortations of their bishop, 65 inured to arms by the
      presence of danger, and convinced of the intentions of Sapor to
      plant a Persian colony in their room, and to lead them away into
      distant and barbarous captivity. The event of the two former
      sieges elated their confidence, and exasperated the haughty
      spirit of the Great King, who advanced a third time towards
      Nisibis, at the head of the united forces of Persia and India.
      The ordinary machines, invented to batter or undermine the walls,
      were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans;
      and many days had vainly elapsed, when Sapor embraced a
      resolution worthy of an eastern monarch, who believed that the
      elements themselves were subject to his power. At the stated
      season of the melting of the snows in Armenia, the River
      Mygdonius, which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis,
      forms, like the Nile, 66 an inundation over the adjacent country.
      By the labor of the Persians, the course of the river was stopped
      below the town, and the waters were confined on every side by
      solid mounds of earth. On this artificial lake, a fleet of armed
      vessels filled with soldiers, and with engines which discharged
      stones of five hundred pounds weight, advanced in order of
      battle, and engaged, almost upon a level, the troops which
      defended the ramparts. 6611 The irresistible force of the waters
      was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a
      portion of the walls, unable to sustain the accumulated pressure,
      gave way at once, and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and
      fifty feet. The Persians were instantly driven to the assault,
      and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day. The
      heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were
      embarrassed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the
      unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters. The
      elephants, made furious by their wounds, increased the disorder,
      and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers. The Great
      King, who, from an exalted throne, beheld the misfortunes of his
      arms, sounded, with reluctant indignation, the signal of the
      retreat, and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the
      attack. But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the
      night; and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in
      height, rising every moment to fill up the interval of the
      breach. Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes, and the
      loss of more than twenty thousand men, Sapor still pressed the
      reduction of Nisibis, with an obstinate firmness, which could
      have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern
      provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the
      Massagetæ. 67 Alarmed by this intelligence, he hastily
      relinquished the siege, and marched with rapid diligence from the
      banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus. The danger and
      difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to
      conclude, or at least to observe, a truce with the Roman emperor,
      which was equally grateful to both princes; as Constantius
      himself, after the death of his two brothers, was involved, by
      the revolutions of the West, in a civil contest, which required
      and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided
      strength.

      After the partition of the empire, three years had scarcely
      elapsed before the sons of Constantine seemed impatient to
      convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting
      themselves with the dominions which they were unqualified to
      govern. The eldest of those princes soon complained, that he was
      defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered
      kinsmen; and though he might yield to the superior guilt and
      merit of Constantius, he exacted from Constans the cession of the
      African provinces, as an equivalent for the rich countries of
      Macedonia and Greece, which his brother had acquired by the death
      of Dalmatius. The want of sincerity, which Constantine
      experienced in a tedious and fruitless negotiation, exasperated
      the fierceness of his temper; and he eagerly listened to those
      favorites, who suggested to him that his honor, as well as his
      interest, was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel. At the
      head of a tumultuary band, suited for rapine rather than for
      conquest, he suddenly broke onto the dominions of Constans, by
      the way of the Julian Alps, and the country round Aquileia felt
      the first effects of his resentment. The measures of Constans,
      who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and
      ability. On the news of his brother’s invasion, he detached a
      select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, proposing to
      follow them in person, with the remainder of his forces. But the
      conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest.

      By the artful appearances of flight, Constantine was betrayed
      into an ambuscade, which had been concealed in a wood, where the
      rash youth, with a few attendants, was surprised, surrounded, and
      slain. His body, after it had been found in the obscure stream of
      the Alsa, obtained the honors of an Imperial sepulchre; but his
      provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror, who,
      refusing to admit his elder brother Constantius to any share in
      these new acquisitions, maintained the undisputed possession of
      more than two thirds of the Roman empire. 68

      Chapter XVIII: Character Of Constantine And His Sons.—Part IV.


      The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer,
      and the revenge of his brother’s death was reserved for the more
      ignoble hand of a domestic traitor. The pernicious tendency of
      the system introduced by Constantine was displayed in the feeble
      administration of his sons; who, by their vices and weakness,
      soon lost the esteem and affections of their people. The pride
      assumed by Constans, from the unmerited success of his arms, was
      rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and
      application. His fond partiality towards some German captives,
      distinguished only by the charms of youth, was an object of
      scandal to the people; 69 and Magnentius, an ambitious soldier,
      who was himself of Barbarian extraction, was encouraged by the
      public discontent to assert the honor of the Roman name. 70 The
      chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians, who acknowledged
      Magnentius as their leader, maintained the most respectable and
      important station in the Imperial camp. The friendship of
      Marcellinus, count of the sacred largesses, supplied with a
      liberal hand the means of seduction. The soldiers were convinced
      by the most specious arguments, that the republic summoned them
      to break the bonds of hereditary servitude; and, by the choice of
      an active and vigilant prince, to reward the same virtues which
      had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a
      private condition to the throne of the world. As soon as the
      conspiracy was ripe for execution, Marcellinus, under the
      pretence of celebrating his son’s birthday, gave a splendid
      entertainment to the _illustrious_ and _honorable_ persons of the
      court of Gaul, which then resided in the city of Autun. The
      intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very
      late hour of the night; and the unsuspecting guests were tempted
      to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of
      conversation. On a sudden the doors were thrown open, and
      Magnentius, who had retired for a few moments, returned into the
      apartment, invested with the diadem and purple. The conspirators
      instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor.
      The surprise, the terror, the intoxication, the ambitious hopes,
      and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly, prompted
      them to join their voices to the general acclamation. The guards
      hastened to take the oath of fidelity; the gates of the town were
      shut; and before the dawn of day, Magnentius became master of the
      troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun. By his
      secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the
      person of Constans, who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his
      favorite amusement of hunting, or perhaps some pleasures of a
      more private and criminal nature. The rapid progress of fame
      allowed him, however, an instant for flight, though the desertion
      of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of
      resistance. Before he could reach a seaport in Spain, where he
      intended to embark, he was overtaken near Helena, 71 at the foot
      of the Pyrenees, by a party of light cavalry, whose chief,
      regardless of the sanctity of a temple, executed his commission
      by the murder of the son of Constantine. 72

      As soon as the death of Constans had decided this easy but
      important revolution, the example of the court of Autun was
      imitated by the provinces of the West. The authority of
      Magnentius was acknowledged through the whole extent of the two
      great præfectures of Gaul and Italy; and the usurper prepared, by
      every act of oppression, to collect a treasure, which might
      discharge the obligation of an immense donative, and supply the
      expenses of a civil war. The martial countries of Illyricum, from
      the Danube to the extremity of Greece, had long obeyed the
      government of Vetranio, an aged general, beloved for the
      simplicity of his manners, and who had acquired some reputation
      by his experience and services in war. 73 Attached by habit, by
      duty, and by gratitude, to the house of Constantine, he
      immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving
      son of his late master, that he would expose, with unshaken
      fidelity, his person and his troops, to inflict a just revenge on
      the traitors of Gaul. But the legions of Vetranio were seduced,
      rather than provoked, by the example of rebellion; their leader
      soon betrayed a want of firmness, or a want of sincerity; and his
      ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the
      princess Constantina. That cruel and aspiring woman, who had
      obtained from the great Constantine, her father, the rank of
      _Augusta_, placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of
      the Illyrian general; and seemed to expect from his victory the
      accomplishment of those unbounded hopes, of which she had been
      disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus. Perhaps
      it was without the consent of Constantina, that the new emperor
      formed a necessary, though dishonorable, alliance with the
      usurper of the West, whose purple was so recently stained with
      her brother’s blood. 74

      73 (return) [ Eutropius (x. 10) describes Vetranio with more
      temper, and probably with more truth, than either of the two
      Victors. Vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest
      parts of Mæsia; and so much had his education been neglected,
      that, after his elevation, he studied the alphabet.]

      74 (return) [ The doubtful, fluctuating conduct of Vetranio is
      described by Julian in his first oration, and accurately
      explained by Spanheim, who discusses the situation and behavior
      of Constantina.]

      The intelligence of these important events, which so deeply
      affected the honor and safety of the Imperial house, recalled the
      arms of Constantius from the inglorious prosecution of the
      Persian war. He recommended the care of the East to his
      lieutenants, and afterwards to his cousin Gallus, whom he raised
      from a prison to a throne; and marched towards Europe, with a
      mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear, of grief and
      indignation. On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace, the emperor
      gave audience to the ambassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio. The
      first author of the conspiracy Marcellinus, who in some measure
      had bestowed the purple on his new master, boldly accepted this
      dangerous commission; and his three colleagues were selected from
      the illustrious personages of the state and army. These deputies
      were instructed to soothe the resentment, and to alarm the fears,
      of Constantius. They were empowered to offer him the friendship
      and alliance of the western princes, to cement their union by a
      double marriage; of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius,
      and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina; and to
      acknowledge in the treaty the preëminence of rank, which might
      justly be claimed by the emperor of the East. Should pride and
      mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions, the
      ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin
      which must attend his rashness, if he ventured to provoke the
      sovereigns of the West to exert their superior strength; and to
      employ against him that valor, those abilities, and those
      legions, to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for
      so many triumphs. Such propositions and such arguments appeared
      to deserve the most serious attention; the answer of Constantius
      was deferred till the next day; and as he had reflected on the
      importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the
      people, he thus addressed his council, who listened with real or
      affected credulity: “Last night,” said he, “after I retired to
      rest, the shade of the great Constantine, embracing the corpse of
      my murdered brother, rose before my eyes; his well-known voice
      awakened me to revenge, forbade me to despair of the republic,
      and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would
      crown the justice of my arms.” The authority of such a vision, or
      rather of the prince who alleged it, silenced every doubt, and
      excluded all negotiation. The ignominious terms of peace were
      rejected with disdain. One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was
      dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius; his colleagues,
      as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations, were put in
      irons; and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable
      war. 75

      75 (return) [ See Peter the Patrician, in the Excerpta Legationem
      p. 27.]

      Such was the conduct, and such perhaps was the duty, of the
      brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul. The
      situation and character of Vetranio admitted of milder measures;
      and the policy of the Eastern emperor was directed to disunite
      his antagonists, and to separate the forces of Illyricum from the
      cause of rebellion. It was an easy task to deceive the frankness
      and simplicity of Vetranio, who, fluctuating some time between
      the opposite views of honor and interest, displayed to the world
      the insincerity of his temper, and was insensibly engaged in the
      snares of an artful negotiation. Constantius acknowledged him as
      a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire, on condition that
      he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius, and
      appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective
      provinces; where they might pledge their friendship by mutual
      vows of fidelity, and regulate by common consent the future
      operations of the civil war. In consequence of this agreement,
      Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica, 76 at the head of
      twenty thousand horse, and of a more numerous body of infantry; a
      power so far superior to the forces of Constantius, that the
      Illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his
      rival, who, depending on the success of his private negotiations,
      had seduced the troops, and undermined the throne, of Vetranio.
      The chiefs, who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius,
      prepared in his favor a public spectacle, calculated to discover
      and inflame the passions of the multitude. 77 The united armies
      were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city. In the
      centre, according to the rules of ancient discipline, a military
      tribunal, or rather scaffold, was erected, from whence the
      emperors were accustomed, on solemn and important occasions, to
      harangue the troops. The well-ordered ranks of Romans and
      Barbarians, with drawn swords, or with erected spears, the
      squadrons of cavalry, and the cohorts of infantry, distinguished
      by the variety of their arms and ensigns, formed an immense
      circle round the tribunal; and the attentive silence which they
      preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamor or
      of applause. In the presence of this formidable assembly, the two
      emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public
      affairs: the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of
      Constantius; and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts
      of rhetoric, he acquitted himself, under these difficult
      circumstances, with firmness, dexterity, and eloquence. The first
      part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant
      of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of
      Constans, he insinuated, that none, except a brother, could claim
      a right to the succession of his brother. He displayed, with some
      complacency, the glories of his Imperial race; and recalled to
      the memory of the troops the valor, the triumphs, the liberality
      of the great Constantine, to whose sons they had engaged their
      allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the ingratitude of his
      most favored servants had tempted them to violate. The officers,
      who surrounded the tribunal, and were instructed to act their
      part in this extraordinary scene, confessed the irresistible
      power of reason and eloquence, by saluting the emperor
      Constantius as their lawful sovereign. The contagion of loyalty
      and repentance was communicated from rank to rank; till the plain
      of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of “Away with
      these upstart usurpers! Long life and victory to the son of
      Constantine! Under his banners alone we will fight and conquer.”
      The shout of thousands, their menacing gestures, the fierce
      clashing of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of
      Vetranio, who stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in
      anxious and silent suspense. Instead of embracing the last refuge
      of generous despair, he tamely submitted to his fate; and taking
      the diadem from his head, in the view of both armies fell
      prostrate at the feet of his conqueror. Constantius used his
      victory with prudence and moderation; and raising from the ground
      the aged suppliant, whom he affected to style by the endearing
      name of Father, he gave him his hand to descend from the throne.
      The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the
      abdicated monarch, who lived six years in the enjoyment of ease
      and affluence. He often expressed his grateful sense of the
      goodness of Constantius, and, with a very amiable simplicity,
      advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world, and to
      seek for content (where alone it could be found) in the peaceful
      obscurity of a private condition. 78

      stultitiam simplicissimus.]

      The behavior of Constantius on this memorable occasion was
      celebrated with some appearance of justice; and his courtiers
      compared the studied orations which a Pericles or a Demosthenes
      addressed to the populace of Athens, with the victorious
      eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and
      depose the object of their partial choice. 79 The approaching
      contest with Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind.
      The tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter Constantius, at
      the head of a numerous army, composed of Gauls and Spaniards, of
      Franks and Saxons; of those provincials who supplied the strength
      of the legions, and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the
      most formidable enemies of the republic. The fertile plains 80 of
      the Lower Pannonia, between the Drave, the Save, and the Danube,
      presented a spacious theatre; and the operations of the civil war
      were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity
      of the combatants. 81 Constantius had declared his intention of
      deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis, a name that would
      animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory, which, on
      the same auspicious ground, had been obtained by the arms of his
      father Constantine. Yet by the impregnable fortifications with
      which the emperor encompassed his camp, he appeared to decline,
      rather than to invite, a general engagement.

      It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his
      adversary to relinquish this advantageous position; and he
      employed, with that view, the various marches, evolutions, and
      stratagems, which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest
      to an experienced officer. He carried by assault the important
      town of Siscia; made an attack on the city of Sirmium, which lay
      in the rear of the Imperial camp, attempted to force a passage
      over the Save into the eastern provinces of Illyricum; and cut in
      pieces a numerous detachment, which he had allured into the
      narrow passes of Adarne. During the greater part of the summer,
      the tyrant of Gaul showed himself master of the field. The troops
      of Constantius were harassed and dispirited; his reputation
      declined in the eye of the world; and his pride condescended to
      solicit a treaty of peace, which would have resigned to the
      assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the
      Alps. These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip the
      Imperial ambassador; and the council as well as the army of
      Magnentius were disposed to accept them. But the haughty usurper,
      careless of the remonstrances of his friends, gave orders that
      Philip should be detained as a captive, or, at least, as a
      hostage; while he despatched an officer to reproach Constantius
      with the weakness of his reign, and to insult him by the promise
      of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple. “That he
      should confide in the justice of his cause, and the protection of
      an avenging Deity,” was the only answer which honor permitted the
      emperor to return. But he was so sensible of the difficulties of
      his situation, that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity
      which had been offered to his representative. The negotiation of
      Philip was not, however, ineffectual, since he determined
      Sylvanus the Frank, a general of merit and reputation, to desert
      with a considerable body of cavalry, a few days before the battle
      of Mursa.

      with attention, and received with caution.]

      The city of Mursa, or Essek, celebrated in modern times for a
      bridge of boats, five miles in length, over the River Drave, and
      the adjacent morasses, 82 has been always considered as a place
      of importance in the wars of Hungary. Magnentius, directing his
      march towards Mursa, set fire to the gates, and, by a sudden
      assault, had almost scaled the walls of the town. The vigilance
      of the garrison extinguished the flames; the approach of
      Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the
      siege; and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could
      embarrass his motions, by forcing a body of troops which had
      taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre. The field of battle
      round Mursa was a naked and level plain: on this ground the army
      of Constantius formed, with the Drave on their right; while their
      left, either from the nature of their disposition, or from the
      superiority of their cavalry, extended far beyond the right flank
      of Magnentius. 83 The troops on both sides remained under arms,
      in anxious expectation, during the greatest part of the morning;
      and the son of Constantine, after animating his soldiers by an
      eloquent speech, retired into a church at some distance from the
      field of battle, and committed to his generals the conduct of
      this decisive day. 84 They deserved his confidence by the valor
      and military skill which they exerted. They wisely began the
      action upon the left; and advancing their whole wing of cavalry
      in an oblique line, they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank
      of the enemy, which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of
      their charge. But the Romans of the West soon rallied, by the
      habits of discipline; and the Barbarians of Germany supported the
      renown of their national bravery. The engagement soon became
      general; was maintained with various and singular turns of
      fortune; and scarcely ended with the darkness of the night. The
      signal victory which Constantius obtained is attributed to the
      arms of his cavalry. His cuirassiers are described as so many
      massy statues of steel, glittering with their scaly armor, and
      breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the Gallic
      legions. As soon as the legions gave way, the lighter and more
      active squadrons of the second line rode sword in hand into the
      intervals, and completed the disorder. In the mean while, the
      huge bodies of the Germans were exposed almost naked to the
      dexterity of the Oriental archers; and whole troops of those
      Barbarians were urged by anguish and despair to precipitate
      themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave. 85 The
      number of the slain was computed at fifty-four thousand men, and
      the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that
      of the vanquished; 86 a circumstance which proves the obstinacy
      of the contest, and justifies the observation of an ancient
      writer, that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal
      battle of Mursa, by the loss of a veteran army, sufficient to
      defend the frontiers, or to add new triumphs to the glory of
      Rome. 87 Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator,
      there is not the least reason to believe that the tyrant deserted
      his own standard in the beginning of the engagement. He seems to
      have displayed the virtues of a general and of a soldier till the
      day was irrecoverably lost, and his camp in the possession of the
      enemy. Magnentius then consulted his safety, and throwing away
      the Imperial ornaments, escaped with some difficulty from the
      pursuit of the light horse, who incessantly followed his rapid
      flight from the banks of the Drave to the foot of the Julian
      Alps. 88

      by the author or his transcribers. Magnentius had collected the
      whole force of the West, Romans and Barbarians, into one
      formidable body, which cannot fairly be estimated at less than
      100,000 men. Julian. Orat. i. p. 34, 35.]

      a singular light: “Sermonis acer, animi tumidi, et immodice
      timidus; artifex tamen ad occultandam audaciæ specie formidinem.”
      Is it most likely that in the battle of Mursa his behavior was
      governed by nature or by art should incline for the latter.]

      The approach of winter supplied the indolence of Constantius with
      specious reasons for deferring the prosecution of the war till
      the ensuing spring. Magnentius had fixed his residence in the
      city of Aquileia, and showed a seeming resolution to dispute the
      passage of the mountains and morasses which fortified the
      confines of the Venetian province. The surprisal of a castle in
      the Alps by the secret march of the Imperialists, could scarcely
      have determined him to relinquish the possession of Italy, if the
      inclinations of the people had supported the cause of their
      tyrant. 89 But the memory of the cruelties exercised by his
      ministers, after the unsuccessful revolt of Nepotian, had left a
      deep impression of horror and resentment on the minds of the
      Romans. That rash youth, the son of the princess Eutropia, and
      the nephew of Constantine, had seen with indignation the sceptre
      of the West usurped by a perfidious barbarian. Arming a desperate
      troop of slaves and gladiators, he overpowered the feeble guard
      of the domestic tranquillity of Rome, received the homage of the
      senate, and assuming the title of Augustus, precariously reigned
      during a tumult of twenty-eight days. The march of some regular
      forces put an end to his ambitious hopes: the rebellion was
      extinguished in the blood of Nepotian, of his mother Eutropia,
      and of his adherents; and the proscription was extended to all
      who had contracted a fatal alliance with the name and family of
      Constantine. 90 But as soon as Constantius, after the battle of
      Mursa, became master of the sea-coast of Dalmatia, a band of
      noble exiles, who had ventured to equip a fleet in some harbor of
      the Adriatic, sought protection and revenge in his victorious
      camp. By their secret intelligence with their countrymen, Rome
      and the Italian cities were persuaded to display the banners of
      Constantius on their walls. The grateful veterans, enriched by
      the liberality of the father, signalized their gratitude and
      loyalty to the son. The cavalry, the legions, and the auxiliaries
      of Italy, renewed their oath of allegiance to Constantius; and
      the usurper, alarmed by the general desertion, was compelled,
      with the remains of his faithful troops, to retire beyond the
      Alps into the provinces of Gaul. The detachments, however, which
      were ordered either to press or to intercept the flight of
      Magnentius, conducted themselves with the usual imprudence of
      success; and allowed him, in the plains of Pavia, an opportunity
      of turning on his pursuers, and of gratifying his despair by the
      carnage of a useless victory. 91

      The pride of Magnentius was reduced, by repeated misfortunes, to
      sue, and to sue in vain, for peace. He first despatched a
      senator, in whose abilities he confided, and afterwards several
      bishops, whose holy character might obtain a more favorable
      audience, with the offer of resigning the purple, and the promise
      of devoting the remainder of his life to the service of the
      emperor. But Constantius, though he granted fair terms of pardon
      and reconciliation to all who abandoned the standard of
      rebellion, 92 avowed his inflexible resolution to inflict a just
      punishment on the crimes of an assassin, whom he prepared to
      overwhelm on every side by the effort of his victorious arms. An
      Imperial fleet acquired the easy possession of Africa and Spain,
      confirmed the wavering faith of the Moorish nations, and landed a
      considerable force, which passed the Pyrenees, and advanced
      towards Lyons, the last and fatal station of Magnentius. 93 The
      temper of the tyrant, which was never inclined to clemency, was
      urged by distress to exercise every act of oppression which could
      extort an immediate supply from the cities of Gaul. 94 Their
      patience was at length exhausted; and Treves, the seat of
      Prætorian government, gave the signal of revolt, by shutting her
      gates against Decentius, who had been raised by his brother to
      the rank either of Cæsar or of Augustus. 95 From Treves,
      Decentius was obliged to retire to Sens, where he was soon
      surrounded by an army of Germans, whom the pernicious arts of
      Constantius had introduced into the civil dissensions of Rome. 96
      In the mean time, the Imperial troops forced the passages of the
      Cottian Alps, and in the bloody combat of Mount Seleucus
      irrevocably fixed the title of rebels on the party of Magnentius.
      97 He was unable to bring another army into the field; the
      fidelity of his guards was corrupted; and when he appeared in
      public to animate them by his exhortations, he was saluted with a
      unanimous shout of “Long live the emperor Constantius!” The
      tyrant, who perceived that they were preparing to deserve pardon
      and rewards by the sacrifice of the most obnoxious criminal,
      prevented their design by falling on his sword; 98 a death more
      easy and more honorable than he could hope to obtain from the
      hands of an enemy, whose revenge would have been colored with the
      specious pretence of justice and fraternal piety. The example of
      suicide was imitated by Decentius, who strangled himself on the
      news of his brother’s death. The author of the conspiracy,
      Marcellinus, had long since disappeared in the battle of Mursa,
      99 and the public tranquillity was confirmed by the execution of
      the surviving leaders of a guilty and unsuccessful faction. A
      severe inquisition was extended over all who, either from choice
      or from compulsion, had been involved in the cause of rebellion.
      Paul, surnamed Catena from his superior skill in the judicial
      exercise of tyranny, 9911 was sent to explore the latent remains
      of the conspiracy in the remote province of Britain. The honest
      indignation expressed by Martin, vice-præfect of the island, was
      interpreted as an evidence of his own guilt; and the governor was
      urged to the necessity of turning against his breast the sword
      with which he had been provoked to wound the Imperial minister.
      The most innocent subjects of the West were exposed to exile and
      confiscation, to death and torture; and as the timid are always
      cruel, the mind of Constantius was inaccessible to mercy. 100

      The divided provinces of the empire were again united by the
      victory of Constantius; but as that feeble prince was destitute
      of personal merit, either in peace or war; as he feared his
      generals, and distrusted his ministers; the triumph of his arms
      served only to establish the reign of the _eunuchs_ over the
      Roman world. Those unhappy beings, the ancient production of
      Oriental jealousy and despotism, 1 were introduced into Greece
      and Rome by the contagion of Asiatic luxury. 2 Their progress was
      rapid; and the eunuchs, who, in the time of Augustus, had been
      abhorred, as the monstrous retinue of an Egyptian queen, 3 were
      gradually admitted into the families of matrons, of senators, and
      of the emperors themselves. 4 Restrained by the severe edicts of
      Domitian and Nerva, cherished by the pride of Diocletian, reduced
      to an humble station by the prudence of Constantine, 6 they
      multiplied in the palaces of his degenerate sons, and insensibly
      acquired the knowledge, and at length the direction, of the
      secret councils of Constantius. The aversion and contempt which
      mankind had so uniformly entertained for that imperfect species,
      appears to have degraded their character, and to have rendered
      them almost as incapable as they were supposed to be, of
      conceiving any generous sentiment, or of performing any worthy
      action. 7 But the eunuchs were skilled in the arts of flattery
      and intrigue; and they alternately governed the mind of
      Constantius by his fears, his indolence, and his vanity. 8 Whilst
      he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public
      prosperity, he supinely permitted them to intercept the
      complaints of the injured provinces, to accumulate immense
      treasures by the sale of justice and of honors; to disgrace the
      most important dignities, by the promotion of those who had
      purchased at their hands the powers of oppression, 9 and to
      gratify their resentment against the few independent spirits, who
      arrogantly refused to solicit the protection of slaves. Of these
      slaves the most distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius, who
      ruled the monarch and the palace with such absolute sway, that
      Constantius, according to the sarcasm of an impartial historian,
      possessed some credit with this haughty favorite. 10 By his
      artful suggestions, the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the
      condemnation of the unfortunate Gallus, and to add a new crime to
      the long list of unnatural murders which pollute the honor of the
      house of Constantine.

      benefactor. But a long experience has contradicted the judgment
      of Cyrus. Some particular instances may occur of eunuchs
      distinguished by their fidelity, their valor, and their
      abilities; but if we examine the general history of Persia,

      When the two nephews of Constantine, Gallus and Julian, were
      saved from the fury of the soldiers, the former was about twelve,
      and the latter about six, years of age; and, as the eldest was
      thought to be of a sickly constitution, they obtained with the
      less difficulty a precarious and dependent life, from the
      affected pity of Constantius, who was sensible that the execution
      of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed, by all
      mankind, an act of the most deliberate cruelty. 11 Different
      cities of Ionia and Bithynia were assigned for the places of
      their exile and education; but as soon as their growing years
      excited the jealousy of the emperor, he judged it more prudent to
      secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum,
      near Cæsarea. The treatment which they experienced during a six
      years’ confinement, was partly such as they could hope from a
      careful guardian, and partly such as they might dread from a
      suspicious tyrant. 12 Their prison was an ancient palace, the
      residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the situation was pleasant,
      the buildings stately, the enclosure spacious. They pursued their
      studies, and practised their exercises, under the tuition of the
      most skilful masters; and the numerous household appointed to
      attend, or rather to guard, the nephews of Constantine, was not
      unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they could not
      disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of
      freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom
      they could trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their
      melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands
      of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of
      reconciliation. At length, however, the emergencies of the state
      compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs, to invest Gallus,
      in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of Cæsar, and
      to cement this political connection by his marriage with the
      princess Constantina. After a formal interview, in which the two
      princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake any thing
      to the prejudice of each other, they repaired without delay to
      their respective stations. Constantius continued his march
      towards the West, and Gallus fixed his residence at Antioch; from
      whence, with a delegated authority, he administered the five
      great dioceses of the eastern præfecture. 13 In this fortunate
      change, the new Cæsar was not unmindful of his brother Julian,
      who obtained the honors of his rank, the appearances of liberty,
      and the restitution of an ample patrimony. 14

      character with generous firmness; but M. de Tillemont (Hist. des
      Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 1120) thinks it very improbable that a
      heretic should have possessed such virtue.]

      14 (return) [ Julian was at first permitted to pursue his studies

      excited the jealousy of Constantius; and the young prince was

      Bithynia and Ionia.]

      The writers the most indulgent to the memory of Gallus, and even
      Julian himself, though he wished to cast a veil over the
      frailties of his brother, are obliged to confess that the Cæsar
      was incapable of reigning. Transported from a prison to a throne,
      he possessed neither genius nor application, nor docility to
      compensate for the want of knowledge and experience. A temper
      naturally morose and violent, instead of being corrected, was
      soured by solitude and adversity; the remembrance of what he had
      endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy; and
      the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who
      approached his person, or were subject to his power. 15
      Constantina, his wife, is described, not as a woman, but as one
      of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of
      human blood. 16 Instead of employing her influence to insinuate
      the mild counsels of prudence and humanity, she exasperated the
      fierce passions of her husband; and as she retained the vanity,
      though she had renounced, the gentleness of her sex, a pearl
      necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an
      innocent and virtuous nobleman. 17 The cruelty of Gallus was
      sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or
      military executions; and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of
      law, and the forms of judicial proceedings. The private houses of
      Antioch, and the places of public resort, were besieged by spies
      and informers; and the Cæsar himself, concealed in a a plebeian
      habit, very frequently condescended to assume that odious
      character. Every apartment of the palace was adorned with the
      instruments of death and torture, and a general consternation was
      diffused through the capital of Syria. The prince of the East, as
      if he had been conscious how much he had to fear, and how little
      he deserved to reign, selected for the objects of his resentment
      the provincials accused of some imaginary treason, and his own
      courtiers, whom with more reason he suspected of incensing, by
      their secret correspondence, the timid and suspicious mind of
      Constantius. But he forgot that he was depriving himself of his
      only support, the affection of the people; whilst he furnished
      the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth, and afforded
      the emperor the fairest pretence of exacting the forfeit of his
      purple, and of his life. 18

      and Zosimus names (l. ii. p. 135) the persons engaged in it; a
      minister of considerable rank, and two obscure agents, who were
      resolved to make their fortune.]

      As long as the civil war suspended the fate of the Roman world,
      Constantius dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel
      administration to which his choice had subjected the East; and
      the discovery of some assassins, secretly despatched to Antioch
      by the tyrant of Gaul, was employed to convince the public, that
      the emperor and the Cæsar were united by the same interest, and
      pursued by the same enemies. 19 But when the victory was decided
      in favor of Constantius, his dependent colleague became less
      useful and less formidable. Every circumstance of his conduct was
      severely and suspiciously examined, and it was privately
      resolved, either to deprive Gallus of the purple, or at least to
      remove him from the indolent luxury of Asia to the hardships and
      dangers of a German war. The death of Theophilus, consular of the
      province of Syria, who in a time of scarcity had been massacred
      by the people of Antioch, with the connivance, and almost at the
      instigation, of Gallus, was justly resented, not only as an act
      of wanton cruelty, but as a dangerous insult on the supreme
      majesty of Constantius. Two ministers of illustrious rank,
      Domitian the Oriental præfect, and Montius, quæstor of the
      palace, were empowered by a special commission 1911 to visit and
      reform the state of the East. They were instructed to behave
      towards Gallus with moderation and respect, and, by the gentlest
      arts of persuasion, to engage him to comply with the invitation
      of his brother and colleague. The rashness of the præfect
      disappointed these prudent measures, and hastened his own ruin,
      as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian
      passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging
      a slight pretence of indisposition, continued several days in
      sullen retirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he
      transmitted to the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the
      pressing solicitations of Gallus, the præfect condescended to
      take his seat in council; but his first step was to signify a
      concise and haughty mandate, importing that the Cæsar should
      immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himself
      would punish his delay or hesitation, by suspending the usual
      allowance of his household. The nephew and daughter of
      Constantine, who could ill brook the insolence of a subject,
      expressed their resentment by instantly delivering Domitian to
      the custody of a guard. The quarrel still admitted of some terms
      of accommodation. They were rendered impracticable by the
      imprudent behavior of Montius, a statesman whose arts and
      experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his
      disposition. 20 The quæstor reproached Gallus in a haughty
      language, that a prince who was scarcely authorized to remove a
      municipal magistrate, should presume to imprison a Prætorian
      præfect; convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers;
      and required them, in the name of their sovereign, to defend the
      person and dignity of his representatives. By this rash
      declaration of war, the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked
      to embrace the most desperate counsels. He ordered his guards to
      stand to their arms, assembled the populace of Antioch, and
      recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge. His
      commands were too fatally obeyed. They rudely seized the præfect
      and the quæstor, and tying their legs together with ropes, they
      dragged them through the streets of the city, inflicted a
      thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims,
      and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into
      the stream of the Orontes. 21

      After such a deed, whatever might have been the designs of
      Gallus, it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his
      innocence with any hope of success. But the mind of that prince
      was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness. Instead
      of assuming the title of Augustus, instead of employing in his
      defence the troops and treasures of the East, he suffered himself
      to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Constantius, who,
      leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled
      the veteran legions from the provinces of Asia. But as it still
      appeared dangerous to arrest Gallus in his capital, the slow and
      safer arts of dissimulation were practised with success. The
      frequent and pressing epistles of Constantius were filled with
      professions of confidence and friendship; exhorting the Cæsar to
      discharge the duties of his high station, to relieve his
      colleague from a part of the public cares, and to assist the West
      by his presence, his counsels, and his arms. After so many
      reciprocal injuries, Gallus had reason to fear and to distrust.
      But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of
      resistance; he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the
      tribune Scudilo, who, under the semblance of a rough soldier,
      disguised the most artful insinuation; and he depended on the
      credit of his wife Constantina, till the unseasonable death of
      that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by

      journey to the Imperial court. From Antioch to Hadrianople, he
      traversed the wide extent of his dominions with a numerous and
      stately train; and as he labored to conceal his apprehensions
      from the world, and perhaps from himself, he entertained the
      people of Constantinople with an exhibition of the games of the
      circus. The progress of the journey might, however, have warned
      him of the impending danger. In all the principal cities he was
      met by ministers of confidence, commissioned to seize the offices
      of government, to observe his motions, and to prevent the hasty
      sallies of his despair. The persons despatched to secure the
      provinces which he left behind, passed him with cold salutations,
      or affected disdain; and the troops, whose station lay along the
      public road, were studiously removed on his approach, lest they
      might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil
      war. 23 After Gallus had been permitted to repose himself a few
      days at Hadrianople, he received a mandate, expressed in the most
      haughty and absolute style, that his splendid retinue should halt
      in that city, while the Cæsar himself, with only ten
      post-carriages, should hasten to the Imperial residence at Milan.

      In this rapid journey, the profound respect which was due to the
      brother and colleague of Constantius, was insensibly changed into
      rude familiarity; and Gallus, who discovered in the countenances
      of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his
      guards, and might soon be employed as his executioners, began to
      accuse his fatal rashness, and to recollect, with terror and
      remorse, the conduct by which he had provoked his fate. The
      dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved, was laid aside
      at Petovio, 2311 in Pannonia. He was conducted to a palace in the
      suburbs, where the general Barbatio, with a select band of
      soldiers, who could neither be moved by pity, nor corrupted by
      rewards, expected the arrival of his illustrious victim. In the
      close of the evening he was arrested, ignominiously stripped of
      the ensigns of Cæsar, and hurried away to Pola, [23b] in Istria,
      a sequestered prison, which had been so recently polluted with
      royal blood. The horror which he felt was soon increased by the
      appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius, who, with
      the assistance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to
      interrogate him concerning the administration of the East. The
      Cæsar sank under the weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the
      criminal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he
      was charged; and by imputing them to the advice of his wife,
      exasperated the indignation of Constantius, who reviewed with
      partial prejudice the minutes of the examination. The emperor was
      easily convinced, that his own safety was incompatible with the
      life of his cousin: the sentence of death was signed, despatched,
      and executed; and the nephew of Constantine, with his hands tied
      behind his back, was beheaded in prison like the vilest
      malefactor. 24 Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties
      of Constantius, assert that he soon relented, and endeavored to
      recall the bloody mandate; but that the second messenger,
      intrusted with the reprieve, was detained by the eunuchs, who
      dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were desirous of
      reuniting to _their_ empire the wealthy provinces of the East. 25

      though celebrated legion, has tempted him on the slightest
      grounds to deny the existence of a Thebæan legion in the Roman
      armies. See Œuvres de Voltaire, tom. xv. p. 414, quarto edition.]

      of Gallus in Ammianus, l. xiv. c. 11. Julian complains that his

      at least to excuse, the cruel revenge which he had inflicted on
      his enemies; but seems at last to acknowledge that he might
      justly have been deprived of the purple.]

      and the latter transcribed, without choice or criticism, whatever
      he found in the writings of the ancients.]

      Besides the reigning emperor, Julian alone survived, of all the
      numerous posterity of Constantius Chlorus. The misfortune of his
      royal birth involved him in the disgrace of Gallus. From his
      retirement in the happy country of Ionia, he was conveyed under a
      strong guard to the court of Milan; where he languished above
      seven months, in the continual apprehension of suffering the same
      ignominious death, which was daily inflicted almost before his
      eyes, on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family. His
      looks, his gestures, his silence, were scrutinized with malignant
      curiosity, and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he
      had never offended, and by arts to which he was a stranger. 26
      But in the school of adversity, Julian insensibly acquired the
      virtues of firmness and discretion. He defended his honor, as
      well as his life, against the insnaring subtleties of the
      eunuchs, who endeavored to extort some declaration of his
      sentiments; and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and
      resentment, he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant, by any
      seeming approbation of his brother’s murder. Julian most devoutly
      ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the
      gods, who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of
      destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house
      of Constantine. 27 As the most effectual instrument of their
      providence, he gratefully acknowledges the steady and generous
      friendship of the empress Eusebia, 28 a woman of beauty and
      merit, who, by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind
      of her husband, counterbalanced, in some measure, the powerful
      conspiracy of the eunuchs. By the intercession of his patroness,
      Julian was admitted into the Imperial presence: he pleaded his
      cause with a decent freedom, he was heard with favor; and,
      notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies, who urged the danger
      of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus, the milder
      sentiment of Eusebia prevailed in the council. But the effects of
      a second interview were dreaded by the eunuchs; and Julian was
      advised to withdraw for a while into the neighborhood of Milan,
      till the emperor thought proper to assign the city of Athens for
      the place of his honorable exile. As he had discovered, from his
      earliest youth, a propensity, or rather passion, for the
      language, the manners, the learning, and the religion of the
      Greeks, he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his
      wishes. Far from the tumult of arms, and the treachery of courts,
      he spent six months under the groves of the academy, in a free
      intercourse with the philosophers of the age, who studied to
      cultivate the genius, to encourage the vanity, and to inflame the
      devotion of their royal pupil. Their labors were not
      unsuccessful; and Julian inviolably preserved for Athens that
      tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind, from
      the recollection of the place where it has discovered and
      exercised its growing powers. The gentleness and affability of
      manners, which his temper suggested and his situation imposed,
      insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers, as well as
      citizens, with whom he conversed. Some of his fellow-students
      might perhaps examine his behavior with an eye of prejudice and
      aversion; but Julian established, in the schools of Athens, a
      general prepossession in favor of his virtues and talents, which
      was soon diffused over the Roman world. 29

      26 (return) [ See Ammianus Marcellin. l. xv. c. 1, 3, 8. Julian
      himself in his epistle to the Athenians, draws a very lively and
      just picture of his own danger, and of his sentiments. He shows,
      however, a tendency to exaggerate his sufferings, by insinuating,
      though in obscure terms, that they lasted above a year; a period
      which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology.]

      27 (return) [ Julian has worked the crimes and misfortunes of the
      family of Constantine into an allegorical fable, which is happily
      conceived and agreeably related. It forms the conclusion of the
      seventh Oration, from whence it has been detached and translated
      by the Abbé de la Bleterie, Vie de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 385-408.]

      a noble family, and the daughter, as well as sister, of consuls.

      divided age, the historians of all parties agree in her praises.

      Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 750-754.]

      29 (return) [ Libanius and Gregory Nazianzen have exhausted the
      arts as well as the powers of their eloquence, to represent
      Julian as the first of heroes, or the worst of tyrants. Gregory
      was his fellow-student at Athens; and the symptoms which he so
      tragically describes, of the future wickedness of the apostate,
      amount only to some bodily imperfections, and to some
      peculiarities in his speech and manner. He protests, however,
      that he _then_ foresaw and foretold the calamities of the church
      and state. (Greg. Nazianzen, Orat. iv. p. 121, 122.)]

      Whilst his hours were passed in studious retirement, the empress,
      resolute to achieve the generous design which she had undertaken,
      was not unmindful of the care of his fortune. The death of the
      late Cæsar had left Constantius invested with the sole command,
      and oppressed by the accumulated weight, of a mighty empire.
      Before the wounds of civil discord could be healed, the provinces
      of Gaul were overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. The
      Sarmatians no longer respected the barrier of the Danube. The
      impunity of rapine had increased the boldness and numbers of the
      wild Isaurians: those robbers descended from their craggy
      mountains to ravage the adjacent country, and had even presumed,
      though without success, to besiege the important city of
      Seleucia, which was defended by a garrison of three Roman
      legions. Above all, the Persian monarch, elated by victory, again
      threatened the peace of Asia, and the presence of the emperor was
      indispensably required, both in the West and in the East. For the
      first time, Constantius sincerely acknowledged, that his single
      strength was unequal to such an extent of care and of dominion.
      30 Insensible to the voice of flattery, which assured him that
      his all-powerful virtue, and celestial fortune, would still
      continue to triumph over every obstacle, he listened with
      complacency to the advice of Eusebia, which gratified his
      indolence, without offending his suspicious pride. As she
      perceived that the remembrance of Gallus dwelt on the emperor’s
      mind, she artfully turned his attention to the opposite
      characters of the two brothers, which from their infancy had been
      compared to those of Domitian and of Titus. 31 She accustomed her
      husband to consider Julian as a youth of a mild, unambitious
      disposition, whose allegiance and gratitude might be secured by
      the gift of the purple, and who was qualified to fill with honor
      a subordinate station, without aspiring to dispute the commands,
      or to shade the glories, of his sovereign and benefactor. After
      an obstinate, though secret struggle, the opposition of the
      favorite eunuchs submitted to the ascendency of the empress; and
      it was resolved that Julian, after celebrating his nuptials with
      Helena, sister of Constantius, should be appointed, with the
      title of Cæsar, to reign over the countries beyond the Alps. 32

      Although the order which recalled him to court was probably
      accompanied by some intimation of his approaching greatness, he
      appeals to the people of Athens to witness his tears of
      undissembled sorrow, when he was reluctantly torn away from his
      beloved retirement. 33 He trembled for his life, for his fame,
      and even for his virtue; and his sole confidence was derived from
      the persuasion, that Minerva inspired all his actions, and that
      he was protected by an invisible guard of angels, whom for that
      purpose she had borrowed from the Sun and Moon. He approached,
      with horror, the palace of Milan; nor could the ingenuous youth
      conceal his indignation, when he found himself accosted with
      false and servile respect by the assassins of his family.
      Eusebia, rejoicing in the success of her benevolent schemes,
      embraced him with the tenderness of a sister; and endeavored, by
      the most soothing caresses, to dispel his terrors, and reconcile
      him to his fortune. But the ceremony of shaving his beard, and
      his awkward demeanor, when he first exchanged the cloak of a
      Greek philosopher for the military habit of a Roman prince,
      amused, during a few days, the levity of the Imperial court. 34

      34 (return) [ Julian himself relates, (p. 274) with some humor,
      the circumstances of his own metamorphoses, his downcast looks,
      and his perplexity at being thus suddenly transported into a new
      world, where every object appeared strange and hostile.]

      The emperors of the age of Constantine no longer deigned to
      consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague; but they
      were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the
      consent of the army. On this solemn occasion, the guards, with
      the other troops whose stations were in the neighborhood of
      Milan, appeared under arms; and Constantius ascended his lofty
      tribunal, holding by the hand his cousin Julian, who entered the
      same day into the twenty-fifth year of his age. 35 In a studied
      speech, conceived and delivered with dignity, the emperor
      represented the various dangers which threatened the prosperity
      of the republic, the necessity of naming a Cæsar for the
      administration of the West, and his own intention, if it was
      agreeable to their wishes, of rewarding with the honors of the
      purple the promising virtues of the nephew of Constantine. The
      approbation of the soldiers was testified by a respectful murmur;
      they gazed on the manly countenance of Julian, and observed with
      pleasure, that the fire which sparkled in his eyes was tempered
      by a modest blush, on being thus exposed, for the first time, to
      the public view of mankind. As soon as the ceremony of his
      investiture had been performed, Constantius addressed him with
      the tone of authority which his superior age and station
      permitted him to assume; and exhorting the new Cæsar to deserve,
      by heroic deeds, that sacred and immortal name, the emperor gave
      his colleague the strongest assurances of a friendship which
      should never be impaired by time, nor interrupted by their
      separation into the most distant climes. As soon as the speech
      was ended, the troops, as a token of applause, clashed their
      shields against their knees; 36 while the officers who surrounded
      the tribunal expressed, with decent reserve, their sense of the
      merits of the representative of Constantius.

      36 (return) [ Militares omnes horrendo fragore scuta genibus
      illidentes; quod est prosperitatis indicium plenum; nam contra
      cum hastis clypei feriuntur, iræ documentum est et doloris... ...
      Ammianus adds, with a nice distinction, Eumque ut potiori
      reverentia servaretur, nec supra modum laudabant nec infra quam
      decebat.]

      The two princes returned to the palace in the same chariot; and
      during the slow procession, Julian repeated to himself a verse of
      his favorite Homer, which he might equally apply to his fortune
      and to his fears. 37 The four-and-twenty days which the Cæsar
      spent at Milan after his investiture, and the first months of his
      Gallic reign, were devoted to a splendid but severe captivity;
      nor could the acquisition of honor compensate for the loss of
      freedom. 38 His steps were watched, his correspondence was
      intercepted; and he was obliged, by prudence, to decline the
      visits of his most intimate friends. Of his former domestics,
      four only were permitted to attend him; two pages, his physician,
      and his librarian; the last of whom was employed in the care of a
      valuable collection of books, the gift of the empress, who
      studied the inclinations as well as the interest of her friend.
      In the room of these faithful servants, a household was formed,
      such indeed as became the dignity of a Cæsar; but it was filled
      with a crowd of slaves, destitute, and perhaps incapable, of any
      attachment for their new master, to whom, for the most part, they
      were either unknown or suspected. His want of experience might
      require the assistance of a wise council; but the minute
      instructions which regulated the service of his table, and the
      distribution of his hours, were adapted to a youth still under
      the discipline of his preceptors, rather than to the situation of
      a prince intrusted with the conduct of an important war. If he
      aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects, he was checked by
      the fear of displeasing his sovereign; and even the fruits of his
      marriage-bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia 39
      herself, who, on this occasion alone, seems to have been
      unmindful of the tenderness of her sex, and the generosity of her
      character. The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded
      Julian of his own danger, and his apprehensions were increased by
      the recent and unworthy fate of Sylvanus. In the summer which
      preceded his own elevation, that general had been chosen to
      deliver Gaul from the tyranny of the Barbarians; but Sylvanus
      soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in
      the Imperial court. A dexterous informer, countenanced by several
      of the principal ministers, procured from him some recommendatory
      letters; and erasing the whole of the contents, except the
      signature, filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high
      and treasonable import. By the industry and courage of his
      friends, the fraud was however detected, and in a great council
      of the civil and military officers, held in the presence of the
      emperor himself, the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly
      acknowledged. But the discovery came too late; the report of the
      calumny, and the hasty seizure of his estate, had already
      provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so
      unjustly accused. He assumed the purple at his head- quarters of
      Cologne, and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an
      invasion, and Milan with a siege. In this emergency, Ursicinus, a
      general of equal rank, regained, by an act of treachery, the
      favor which he had lost by his eminent services in the East.
      Exasperated, as he might speciously allege, by the injuries of a
      similar nature, he hastened with a few followers to join the
      standard, and to betray the confidence, of his too credulous
      friend. After a reign of only twenty-eight days, Sylvanus was
      assassinated: the soldiers who, without any criminal intention,
      had blindly followed the example of their leader, immediately
      returned to their allegiance; and the flatterers of Constantius
      celebrated the wisdom and felicity of the monarch who had
      extinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle. 40

      37 (return) [ The word _purple_ which Homer had used as a vague
      but common epithet for death, was applied by Julian to express,
      very aptly, the nature and object of his own apprehensions.]

      38 (return) [ He represents, in the most pathetic terms, (p.
      277,) the distress of his new situation. The provision for his
      table was, however, so elegant and sumptuous, that the young
      philosopher rejected it with disdain. Quum legeret libellum
      assidue, quem Constantius ut privignum ad studia mittens manû suâ
      conscripserat, prælicenter disponens quid in convivio Cæsaris
      impendi deberit: Phasianum, et vulvam et sumen exigi vetuit et
      inferri. Ammian. Marcellin. l. xvi. c. 5.]

      39 (return) [ If we recollect that Constantine, the father of
      Helena, died above eighteen years before, in a mature old age, it
      will appear probable, that the daughter, though a virgin, could
      not be very young at the time of her marriage. She was soon
      afterwards delivered of a son, who died immediately, quod
      obstetrix corrupta mercede, mox natum præsecto plusquam
      convenerat umbilico necavit. She accompanied the emperor and
      empress in their journey to Rome, and the latter, quæsitum
      venenum bibere per fraudem illexit, ut quotiescunque concepisset,
      immaturum abjicerit partum. Ammian. l. xvi. c. 10. Our physicians
      will determine whether there exists such a poison. For my own
      part I am inclined to hope that the public malignity imputed the
      effects of accident as the guilt of Eusebia.]

      40 (return) [ Ammianus (xv. v.) was perfectly well informed of
      the conduct and fate of Sylvanus. He himself was one of the few
      followers who attended Ursicinus in his dangerous enterprise.]

      The protection of the Rhætian frontier, and the persecution of
      the Catholic church, detained Constantius in Italy above eighteen
      months after the departure of Julian. Before the emperor returned
      into the East, he indulged his pride and curiosity in a visit to
      the ancient capital. 41 He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the
      Æmilian and Flaminian ways, and as soon as he approached within
      forty miles of the city, the march of a prince who had never
      vanquished a foreign enemy, assumed the appearance of a triumphal
      procession. His splendid train was composed of all the ministers
      of luxury; but in a time of profound peace, he was encompassed by
      the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and
      cuirassiers. Their streaming banners of silk, embossed with gold,
      and shaped in the form of dragons, waved round the person of the
      emperor. Constantius sat alone in a lofty car, resplendent with
      gold and precious gems; and, except when he bowed his head to
      pass under the gates of the cities, he affected a stately
      demeanor of inflexible, and, as it might seem, of insensible
      gravity. The severe discipline of the Persian youth had been
      introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace; and such were
      the habits of patience which they had inculcated, that during a
      slow and sultry march, he was never seen to move his hand towards
      his face, or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left.
      He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome; and the
      emperor surveyed, with attention, the civil honors of the
      republic, and the consular images of the noble families. The
      streets were lined with an innumerable multitude. Their repeated
      acclamations expressed their joy at beholding, after an absence
      of thirty-two years, the sacred person of their sovereign, and
      Constantius himself expressed, with some pleasantry, he affected
      surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on
      the same spot. The son of Constantine was lodged in the ancient
      palace of Augustus: he presided in the senate, harangued the
      people from the tribunal which Cicero had so often ascended,
      assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the Circus, and
      accepted the crowns of gold, as well as the Panegyrics which had
      been prepared for the ceremony by the deputies of the principal
      cities. His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing
      the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the
      seven hills and the interjacent valleys. He admired the awful
      majesty of the Capitol, the vast extent of the baths of Caracalla
      and Diocletian, the severe simplicity of the Pantheon, the massy
      greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant architecture
      of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace, and, above all,
      the stately structure of the Forum and column of Trajan;
      acknowledging that the voice of fame, so prone to invent and to
      magnify, had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the
      world. The traveller, who has contemplated the ruins of ancient
      Rome, may conceive some imperfect idea of the sentiments which
      they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the
      splendor of unsullied beauty.

      Themistius was appointed deputy from Constantinople, and that he
      composed his fourth oration for his ceremony.]

      The satisfaction which Constantius had received from this journey
      excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the Romans
      some memorial of his own gratitude and munificence. His first
      idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he
      had seen in the Forum of Trajan; but when he had maturely weighed
      the difficulties of the execution, 42 he chose rather to
      embellish the capital by the gift of an Egyptian obelisk. In a
      remote but polished age, which seems to have preceded the
      invention of alphabetical writing, a great number of these
      obelisks had been erected, in the cities of Thebes and
      Heliopolis, by the ancient sovereigns of Egypt, in a just
      confidence that the simplicity of their form, and the hardness of
      their substance, would resist the injuries of time and violence.
      43 Several of these extraordinary columns had been transported to
      Rome by Augustus and his successors, as the most durable
      monuments of their power and victory; 44 but there remained one
      obelisk, which, from its size or sanctity, escaped for a long
      time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors. It was designed by
      Constantine to adorn his new city; 45 and, after being removed by
      his order from the pedestal where it stood before the Temple of
      the Sun at Heliopolis, was floated down the Nile to Alexandria.
      The death of Constantine suspended the execution of his purpose,
      and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital
      of the empire. A vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness
      was provided to convey this enormous weight of granite, at least
      a hundred and fifteen feet in length, from the banks of the Nile
      to those of the Tyber. The obelisk of Constantius was landed
      about three miles from the city, and elevated, by the efforts of
      art and labor, in the great Circus of Rome. 46 4611

      him, to find that men died at Rome as well as elsewhere.” If we
      adopt this reading of the text of Ammianus, (_displicuisse_,

      The departure of Constantius from Rome was hastened by the
      alarming intelligence of the distress and danger of the Illyrian
      provinces. The distractions of civil war, and the irreparable
      loss which the Roman legions had sustained in the battle of
      Mursa, exposed those countries, almost without defence, to the
      light cavalry of the Barbarians; and particularly to the inroads
      of the Quadi, a fierce and powerful nation, who seem to have
      exchanged the institutions of Germany for the arms and military
      arts of their Sarmatian allies. 47 The garrisons of the frontiers
      were insufficient to check their progress; and the indolent
      monarch was at length compelled to assemble, from the extremities
      of his dominions, the flower of the Palatine troops, to take the
      field in person, and to employ a whole campaign, with the
      preceding autumn and the ensuing spring, in the serious
      prosecution of the war. The emperor passed the Danube on a bridge
      of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march,
      penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and
      severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on
      the Roman province. The dismayed Barbarians were soon reduced to
      sue for peace: they offered the restitution of his captive
      subjects as an atonement for the past, and the noblest hostages
      as a pledge of their future conduct. The generous courtesy which
      was shown to the first among their chieftains who implored the
      clemency of Constantius, encouraged the more timid, or the more
      obstinate, to imitate their example; and the Imperial camp was
      crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant
      tribes, who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland, and who
      might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the
      Carpathian Mountains. While Constantius gave laws to the
      Barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished, with specious
      compassion, the Sarmatian exiles, who had been expelled from
      their native country by the rebellion of their slaves, and who
      formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi.
      The emperor, embracing a generous but artful system of policy,
      released the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating
      dependence, and restored them, by a separate treaty, to the
      dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the
      friend and ally of the republic. He declared his resolution of
      asserting the justice of their cause, and of securing the peace
      of the provinces by the extirpation, or at least the banishment,
      of the Limigantes, whose manners were still infected with the
      vices of their servile origin. The execution of this design was
      attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the
      Limigantes was protected against the Romans by the Danube,
      against the hostile Barbarians by the Teyss. The marshy lands
      which lay between those rivers, and were often covered by their
      inundations, formed an intricate wilderness, pervious only to the
      inhabitants, who were acquainted with its secret paths and
      inaccessible fortresses. On the approach of Constantius, the
      Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms;
      but he sternly rejected their supplications, defeated their rude
      stratagems, and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of
      their irregular valor. One of their most warlike tribes,
      established in a small island towards the conflux of the Teyss
      and the Danube, consented to pass the river with the intention of
      surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable
      conference. They soon became the victims of the perfidy which
      they meditated. Encompassed on every side, trampled down by the
      cavalry, slaughtered by the swords of the legions, they disdained
      to ask for mercy; and with an undaunted countenance, still
      grasped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this
      victory, a considerable body of Romans was landed on the opposite
      banks of the Danube; the Taifalæ, a Gothic tribe engaged in the
      service of the empire, invaded the Limigantes on the side of the
      Teyss; and their former masters, the free Sarmatians, animated by
      hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country, into the
      heart of their ancient possessions. A general conflagration
      revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were seated in the
      depth of the wilderness; and the soldier fought with confidence
      on marshy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In
      this extremity, the bravest of the Limigantes were resolved to
      die in arms, rather than to yield: but the milder sentiment,
      enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed;
      and the suppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children,
      repaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth
      of the conqueror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was
      still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to spare the
      remnant of a guilty nation, Constantius assigned for the place of
      their exile a remote country, where they might enjoy a safe and
      honorable repose. The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance; but
      before they could reach, at least before they could occupy, their
      destined habitations, they returned to the banks of the Danube,
      exaggerating the hardships of their situation, and requesting,
      with fervent professions of fidelity, that the emperor would
      grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the
      Roman provinces. Instead of consulting his own experience of
      their incurable perfidy, Constantius listened to his flatterers,
      who were ready to represent the honor and advantage of accepting
      a colony of soldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtain
      the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the
      subjects of the empire. The Limigantes were permitted to pass the
      Danube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large
      plain near the modern city of Buda. They surrounded the tribunal,
      and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and
      dignity when one of the Barbarians, casting his shoe into the
      air, exclaimed with a loud voice, _Marha! Marha!_ 4711 a word of
      defiance, which was received as a signal of the tumult. They
      rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor; his royal
      throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands; but
      the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allowed
      him a moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the
      confusion. The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous
      surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the
      Romans; and the combat was only terminated by the extinction of
      the name and nation of the Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were
      reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats; and although
      Constantius distrusted the levity of their character, he
      entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence
      their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty stature and
      obsequious demeanor of Zizais, one of the noblest of their
      chiefs. He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved
      that he was not unworthy to reign, by a sincere and lasting
      attachment to the interests of his benefactor, who, after this
      splendid success, received the name of _Sarmaticus_ from the
      acclamations of his victorious army. 48

      While the Roman emperor and the Persian monarch, at the distance
      of three thousand miles, defended their extreme limits against
      the Barbarians of the Danube and of the Oxus, their intermediate
      frontier experienced the vicissitudes of a languid war, and a
      precarious truce. Two of the eastern ministers of Constantius,
      the Prætorian præfect Musonian, whose abilities were disgraced by
      the want of truth and integrity, and Cassian, duke of
      Mesopotamia, a hardy and veteran soldier, opened a secret
      negotiation with the satrap Tamsapor. 49 4911 These overtures of
      peace, translated into the servile and flattering language of
      Asia, were transmitted to the camp of the Great King; who
      resolved to signify, by an ambassador, the terms which he was
      inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans. Narses, whom he
      invested with that character, was honorably received in his
      passage through Antioch and Constantinople: he reached Sirmium
      after a long journey, and, at his first audience, respectfully
      unfolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his
      sovereign. Sapor, King of Kings, and Brother of the Sun and Moon,
      (such were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity,)
      expressed his satisfaction that his brother, Constantius Cæsar,
      had been taught wisdom by adversity. As the lawful successor of
      Darius Hystaspes, Sapor asserted, that the River Strymon, in
      Macedonia, was the true and ancient boundary of his empire;
      declaring, however, that as an evidence of his moderation, he
      would content himself with the provinces of Armenia and
      Mesopotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his
      ancestors. He alleged, that, without the restitution of these
      disputed countries, it was impossible to establish any treaty on
      a solid and permanent basis; and he arrogantly threatened, that
      if his ambassador returned in vain, he was prepared to take the
      field in the spring, and to support the justice of his cause by
      the strength of his invincible arms. Narses, who was endowed with
      the most polite and amiable manners, endeavored, as far as was
      consistent with his duty, to soften the harshness of the message.
      50 Both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the
      Imperial council, and he was dismissed with the following answer:
      “Constantius had a right to disclaim the officiousness of his
      ministers, who had acted without any specific orders from the
      throne: he was not, however, averse to an equal and honorable
      treaty; but it was highly indecent, as well as absurd, to propose
      to the sole and victorious emperor of the Roman world, the same
      conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time
      when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the
      East: the chance of arms was uncertain; and Sapor should
      recollect, that if the Romans had sometimes been vanquished in
      battle, they had almost always been successful in the event of
      the war.” A few days after the departure of Narses, three
      ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor, who was already
      returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary residence
      of Ctesiphon. A count, a notary, and a sophist, had been selected
      for this important commission; and Constantius, who was secretly
      anxious for the conclusion of the peace, entertained some hopes
      that the dignity of the first of these ministers, the dexterity
      of the second, and the rhetoric of the third, 51 would persuade
      the Persian monarch to abate of the rigor of his demands. But the
      progress of their negotiation was opposed and defeated by the
      hostile arts of Antoninus, 52 a Roman subject of Syria, who had
      fled from oppression, and was admitted into the councils of
      Sapor, and even to the royal table, where, according to the
      custom of the Persians, the most important business was
      frequently discussed. 53 The dexterous fugitive promoted his
      interest by the same conduct which gratified his revenge. He
      incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the
      favorable opportunity when the bravest of the Palatine troops
      were employed with the emperor in a distant war on the Danube. He
      pressed Sapor to invade the exhausted and defenceless provinces
      of the East, with the numerous armies of Persia, now fortified by
      the alliance and accession of the fiercest Barbarians. The
      ambassadors of Rome retired without success, and a second
      embassy, of a still more honorable rank, was detained in strict
      confinement, and threatened either with death or exile.

      The military historian, 54 who was himself despatched to observe
      the army of the Persians, as they were preparing to construct a
      bridge of boats over the Tigris, beheld from an eminence the
      plain of Assyria, as far as the edge of the horizon, covered with
      men, with horses, and with arms. Sapor appeared in the front,
      conspicuous by the splendor of his purple. On his left hand, the
      place of honor among the Orientals, Grumbates, king of the
      Chionites, displayed the stern countenance of an aged and
      renowned warrior. The monarch had reserved a similar place on his
      right hand for the king of the Albanians, who led his independent
      tribes from the shores of the Caspian. 5411 The satraps and
      generals were distributed according to their several ranks, and
      the whole army, besides the numerous train of Oriental luxury,
      consisted of more than one hundred thousand effective men, inured
      to fatigue, and selected from the bravest nations of Asia. The
      Roman deserter, who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor,
      had prudently advised, that, instead of wasting the summer in
      tedious and difficult sieges, he should march directly to the
      Euphrates, and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble
      and wealthy metropolis of Syria. But the Persians were no sooner
      advanced into the plains of Mesopotamia, than they discovered
      that every precaution had been used which could retard their
      progress, or defeat their design. The inhabitants, with their
      cattle, were secured in places of strength, the green forage
      throughout the country was set on fire, the fords of the rivers
      were fortified by sharp stakes; military engines were planted on
      the opposite banks, and a seasonable swell of the waters of the
      Euphrates deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary
      passage of the bridge of Thapsacus. Their skilful guide, changing
      his plan of operations, then conducted the army by a longer
      circuit, but through a fertile territory, towards the head of the
      Euphrates, where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and
      accessible stream. Sapor overlooked, with prudent disdain, the
      strength of Nisibis; but as he passed under the walls of Amida,
      he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not
      awe the garrison into immediate submission. The sacrilegious
      insult of a random dart, which glanced against the royal tiara,
      convinced him of his error; and the indignant monarch listened
      with impatience to the advice of his ministers, who conjured him
      not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification
      of his resentment. The following day Grumbates advanced towards
      the gates with a select body of troops, and required the instant
      surrender of the city, as the only atonement which could be
      accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence. His proposals
      were answered by a general discharge, and his only son, a
      beautiful and valiant youth, was pierced through the heart by a
      javelin, shot from one of the balistæ. The funeral of the prince
      of the Chionites was celebrated according to the rites of the
      country; and the grief of his aged father was alleviated by the
      solemn promise of Sapor, that the guilty city of Amida should
      serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death, and to perpetuate
      the memory, of his son.

      after this period, a certain Schergir was their king, and it is
      of him doubtless Ammianus Marcellinus speaks. St. Martin, ii.
      285.—M.]

      The ancient city of Amid or Amida, 55 which sometimes assumes the
      provincial appellation of Diarbekir, 56 is advantageously situate
      in a fertile plain, watered by the natural and artificial
      channels of the Tigris, of which the least inconsiderable stream
      bends in a semicircular form round the eastern part of the city.
      The emperor Constantius had recently conferred on Amida the honor
      of his own name, and the additional fortifications of strong
      walls and lofty towers. It was provided with an arsenal of
      military engines, and the ordinary garrison had been reenforced
      to the amount of seven legions, when the place was invested by
      the arms of Sapor. 57 His first and most sanguine hopes depended
      on the success of a general assault. To the several nations which
      followed his standard, their respective posts were assigned; the
      south to the Vertæ; the north to the Albanians; the east to the
      Chionites, inflamed with grief and indignation; the west to the
      Segestans, the bravest of his warriors, who covered their front
      with a formidable line of Indian elephants. 58 The Persians, on
      every side, supported their efforts, and animated their courage;
      and the monarch himself, careless of his rank and safety,
      displayed, in the prosecution of the siege, the ardor of a
      youthful soldier. After an obstinate combat, the Barbarians were
      repulsed; they incessantly returned to the charge; they were
      again driven back with a dreadful slaughter, and two rebel
      legions of Gauls, who had been banished into the East, signalized
      their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart
      of the Persian camp. In one of the fiercest of these repeated
      assaults, Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter, who
      indicated to the Barbarians a secret and neglected staircase,
      scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris.
      Seventy chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to
      the third story of a lofty tower, which commanded the precipice;
      they elevated on high the Persian banner, the signal of
      confidence to the assailants, and of dismay to the besieged; and
      if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few
      minutes longer, the reduction of the place might have been
      purchased by the sacrifice of their lives. After Sapor had tried,
      without success, the efficacy of force and of stratagem, he had
      recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular
      siege, in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of
      the Roman deserters. The trenches were opened at a convenient
      distance, and the troops destined for that service advanced under
      the portable cover of strong hurdles, to fill up the ditch, and
      undermine the foundations of the walls. Wooden towers were at the
      same time constructed, and moved forwards on wheels, till the
      soldiers, who were provided with every species of missile
      weapons, could engage almost on level ground with the troops who
      defended the rampart. Every mode of resistance which art could
      suggest, or courage could execute, was employed in the defence of
      Amida, and the works of Sapor were more than once destroyed by
      the fire of the Romans. But the resources of a besieged city may
      be exhausted. The Persians repaired their losses, and pushed
      their approaches; a large preach was made by the battering-ram,
      and the strength of the garrison, wasted by the sword and by
      disease, yielded to the fury of the assault. The soldiers, the
      citizens, their wives, their children, all who had not time to
      escape through the opposite gate, were involved by the conquerors
      in a promiscuous massacre.

      describes the city as of no great extent, (civitatis ambitum non
      nimium amplæ.) Besides the ordinary population, and those who
      took refuge from the country, it contained 20,000 soldiers. St.

      known to require any description. The Segestans [_Sacastenè. St.

      Hindostan. (See Geographia Nubiensis. p. 133, and D’Herbelot,

      victory of Bahram, (vol. i. p. 410,) the Segestans, above
      fourscore years afterwards, appear as an independent nation, the
      ally of Persia. We are ignorant of the situation of the Vertæ and
      Chionites, but I am inclined to place them (at least the latter)
      towards the confines of India and Scythia. See Ammian. ——Klaproth

      people were already known; and we find from Armenian authors that
      they were making, at this period, incursions into Asia. They were
      often at war with the Persians. The name was perhaps pronounced
      differently in the East and in the West, and this prevents us
      from recognizing it. St. Martin, ii. 177.—M.]

      But the ruin of Amida was the safety of the Roman provinces.

      As soon as the first transports of victory had subsided, Sapor
      was at leisure to reflect, that to chastise a disobedient city,
      he had lost the flower of his troops, and the most favorable
      season for conquest. 59 Thirty thousand of his veterans had
      fallen under the walls of Amida, during the continuance of a
      siege, which lasted seventy-three days; and the disappointed
      monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret
      mortification. It is more than probable, that the inconstancy of
      his Barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which
      they had encountered such unexpected difficulties; and that the
      aged king of the Chionites, satiated with revenge, turned away
      with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of
      the hope of his family and nation. The strength as well as the
      spirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the ensuing
      spring was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his
      ambition. Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East, he was
      obliged to content himself with the reduction of two fortified
      cities of Mesopotamia, Singara and Bezabde; 60 the one situate in
      the midst of a sandy desert, the other in a small peninsula,
      surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of
      the Tigris. Five Roman legions, of the diminutive size to which
      they had been reduced in the age of Constantine, were made
      prisoners, and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines
      of Persia. After dismantling the walls of Singara, the conqueror
      abandoned that solitary and sequestered place; but he carefully
      restored the fortifications of Bezabde, and fixed in that
      important post a garrison or colony of veterans; amply supplied
      with every means of defence, and animated by high sentiments of
      honor and fidelity. Towards the close of the campaign, the arms
      of Sapor incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprise
      against Virtha, or Tecrit, a strong, or, as it was universally
      esteemed till the age of Tamerlane, an impregnable fortress of
      the independent Arabs. 61 6111

      59 (return) [ Ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by
      three signs, which do not perfectly coincide with each other, or
      with the series of the history. 1 The corn was ripe when Sapor
      invaded Mesopotamia; “Cum jam stipula flaveate turgerent;” a
      circumstance, which, in the latitude of Aleppo, would naturally
      refer us to the month of April or May. See Harmer’s Observations
      on Scripture vol. i. p. 41. Shaw’s Travels, p. 335, edit 4to. 2.
      The progress of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the
      Euphrates, which generally happens in July and August. Plin.

      3. When Sapor had taken Amida, after a siege of seventy-three
      days, the autumn was far advanced. “Autumno præcipiti hædorumque
      improbo sidere exorto.” To reconcile these apparent
      contradictions, we must allow for some delay in the Persian king,
      some inaccuracy in the historian, and some disorder in the
      seasons.]

      The defence of the East against the arms of Sapor required and
      would have exercised, the abilities of the most consummate
      general; and it seemed fortunate for the state, that it was the
      actual province of the brave Ursicinus, who alone deserved the
      confidence of the soldiers and people. In the hour of danger, 62
      Ursicinus was removed from his station by the intrigues of the
      eunuchs; and the military command of the East was bestowed, by
      the same influence, on Sabinian, a wealthy and subtle veteran,
      who had attained the infirmities, without acquiring the
      experience, of age. By a second order, which issued from the same
      jealous and inconstant councils, Ursicinus was again despatched
      to the frontier of Mesopotamia, and condemned to sustain the
      labors of a war, the honors of which had been transferred to his
      unworthy rival. Sabinian fixed his indolent station under the
      walls of Edessa; and while he amused himself with the idle parade
      of military exercise, and moved to the sound of flutes in the
      Pyrrhic dance, the public defence was abandoned to the boldness
      and diligence of the former general of the East. But whenever
      Ursicinus recommended any vigorous plan of operations; when he
      proposed, at the head of a light and active army, to wheel round
      the foot of the mountains, to intercept the convoys of the enemy,
      to harass the wide extent of the Persian lines, and to relieve
      the distress of Amida; the timid and envious commander alleged,
      that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering
      the safety of the troops. Amida was at length taken; its bravest
      defenders, who had escaped the sword of the Barbarians, died in
      the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner: and Ursicinus
      himself, after supporting the disgrace of a partial inquiry, was
      punished for the misconduct of Sabinian by the loss of his
      military rank. But Constantius soon experienced the truth of the
      prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured
      lieutenant, that as long as such maxims of government were
      suffered to prevail, the emperor himself would find it is no easy
      task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a
      foreign enemy. When he had subdued or pacified the Barbarians of
      the Danube, Constantius proceeded by slow marches into the East;
      and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of Amida, he formed,
      with a powerful army, the siege of Becabde. The walls were shaken
      by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the
      battering-rams; the town was reduced to the last extremity; but
      it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valor of the
      garrison, till the approach of the rainy season obliged the
      emperor to raise the siege, and ingloviously to retreat into his
      winter quarters at Antioch. 63 The pride of Constantius, and the
      ingenuity of his courtiers, were at a loss to discover any
      materials for panegyric in the events of the Persian war; while
      the glory of his cousin Julian, to whose military command he had
      intrusted the provinces of Gaul, was proclaimed to the world in
      the simple and concise narrative of his exploits.

      In the blind fury of civil discord, Constantius had abandoned to
      the Barbarians of Germany the countries of Gaul, which still
      acknowledged the authority of his rival. A numerous swarm of
      Franks and Alemanni were invited to cross the Rhine by presents
      and promises, by the hopes of spoil, and by a perpetual grant of
      all the territories which they should be able to subdue. 64 But
      the emperor, who for a temporary service had thus imprudently
      provoked the rapacious spirit of the Barbarians, soon discovered
      and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable
      allies, after they had tasted the richness of the Roman soil.
      Regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion,
      these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all
      the subjects of the empire, who possessed any property which they
      were desirous of acquiring Forty-five flourishing cities,
      Tongres, Cologne, Treves, Worms, Spires, Strasburgh, &c., besides
      a far greater number of towns and villages, were pillaged, and
      for the most part reduced to ashes. The Barbarians of Germany,
      still faithful to the maxims of their ancestors, abhorred the
      confinement of walls, to which they applied the odious names of
      prisons and sepulchres; and fixing their independent habitations
      on the banks of rivers, the Rhine, the Moselle, and the Meuse,
      they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise, by a
      rude and hasty fortification of large trees, which were felled
      and thrown across the roads. The Alemanni were established in the
      modern countries of Alsace and Lorraine; the Franks occupied the
      island of the Batavians, together with an extensive district of
      Brabant, which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria, 65
      and may deserve to be considered as the original seat of their
      Gallic monarchy. 66 From the sources, to the mouth, of the Rhine,
      the conquests of the Germans extended above forty miles to the
      west of that river, over a country peopled by colonies of their
      own name and nation: and the scene of their devastations was
      three times more extensive than that of their conquests. At a
      still greater distance the open towns of Gaul were deserted, and
      the inhabitants of the fortified cities, who trusted to their
      strength and vigilance, were obliged to content themselves with
      such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land
      within the enclosure of their walls. The diminished legions,
      destitute of pay and provisions, of arms and discipline, trembled
      at the approach, and even at the name, of the Barbarians.

      Chapter XIX: Constantius Sole Emperor.—Part IV.


      Under these melancholy circumstances, an unexperienced youth was
      appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul, or rather,
      as he expressed it himself, to exhibit the vain image of Imperial
      greatness. The retired scholastic education of Julian, in which
      he had been more conversant with books than with arms, with the
      dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the
      practical arts of war and government; and when he awkwardly
      repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to
      learn, he exclaimed with a sigh, “O Plato, Plato, what a task for
      a philosopher!” Yet even this speculative philosophy, which men
      of business are too apt to despise, had filled the mind of Julian
      with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples; had
      animated him with the love of virtue, the desire of fame, and the
      contempt of death. The habits of temperance recommended in the
      schools, are still more essential in the severe discipline of a
      camp. The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his
      food and sleep. Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided
      for his table, he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and
      common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers. During
      the rigor of a Gallic winter, he never suffered a fire in his
      bed-chamber; and after a short and interrupted slumber, he
      frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread
      on the floor, to despatch any urgent business, to visit his
      rounds, or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his
      favorite studies. 67 The precepts of eloquence, which he had
      hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation, were more
      usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed
      multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of
      conversation and literature, was more familiarly acquainted with
      the beauties of the Greek language, he had attained a competent
      knowledge of the Latin tongue. 68 Since Julian was not originally
      designed for the character of a legislator, or a judge, it is
      probable that the civil jurisprudence of the Romans had not
      engaged any considerable share of his attention: but he derived
      from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice,
      tempered by a disposition to clemency; the knowledge of the
      general principles of equity and evidence, and the faculty of
      patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions
      which could be proposed for his discussion. The measures of
      policy, and the operations of war, must submit to the various
      accidents of circumstance and character, and the unpractised
      student will often be perplexed in the application of the most
      perfect theory.

      But in the acquisition of this important science, Julian was
      assisted by the active vigor of his own genius, as well as by the
      wisdom and experience of Sallust, and officer of rank, who soon
      conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his
      friendship; and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the
      talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the
      delicacy of a royal ear. 69

      67 (return) [ The private life of Julian in Gaul, and the severe
      discipline which he embraced, are displayed by Ammianus, (xvi.
      5,) who professes to praise, and by Julian himself, who affects
      to ridicule, (Misopogon, p. 340,) a conduct, which, in a prince
      of the house of Constantine, might justly excite the surprise of
      mankind.]

      68 (return) [ Aderat Latine quoque disserenti sufficiens sermo.

      excellent minister, whom Julian afterwards created præfect of
      Gaul. Sallust was speedly recalled by the jealousy of the
      emperor; and we may still read a sensible but pedantic discourse,
      (p. 240-252,) in which Julian deplores the loss of so valuable a
      friend, to whom he acknowledges himself indebted for his
      reputation. See La Bleterie, Preface a la Vie de lovien, p. 20.]

      Immediately after Julian had received the purple at Milan, he was
      sent into Gaul with a feeble retinue of three hundred and sixty
      soldiers. At Vienna, where he passed a painful and anxious winter
      in the hands of those ministers to whom Constantius had intrusted
      the direction of his conduct, the Cæsar was informed of the siege
      and deliverance of Autun. That large and ancient city, protected
      only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison, was saved by
      the generous resolution of a few veterans, who resumed their arms
      for the defence of their country. In his march from Autun,
      through the heart of the Gallic provinces, Julian embraced with
      ardor the earliest opportunity of signalizing his courage. At the
      head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry, he preferred
      the shorter but the more dangerous of two roads; 6911 and
      sometimes eluding, and sometimes resisting, the attacks of the
      Barbarians, who were masters of the field, he arrived with honor
      and safety at the camp near Rheims, where the Roman troops had
      been ordered to assemble. The aspect of their young prince
      revived the drooping spirits of the soldiers, and they marched
      from Rheims in search of the enemy, with a confidence which had
      almost proved fatal to them. The Alemanni, familiarized to the
      knowledge of the country, secretly collected their scattered
      forces, and seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day,
      poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of the Romans.
      Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied, two legions
      were destroyed; and Julian was taught by experience that caution
      and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war.
      In a second and more successful action, he recovered and
      established his military fame; but as the agility of the
      Barbarians saved them from the pursuit, his victory was neither
      bloody nor decisive. He advanced, however, to the banks of the
      Rhine, surveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced himself of the
      difficulties of the war, and retreated on the approach of winter,
      discontented with the court, with his army, and with his own
      success. 70 The power of the enemy was yet unbroken; and the
      Cæsar had no sooner separated his troops, and fixed his own
      quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was surrounded
      and besieged, by a numerous host of Germans. Reduced, in this
      extremity, to the resources of his own mind, he displayed a
      prudent intrepidity, which compensated for all the deficiencies
      of the place and garrison; and the Barbarians, at the end of
      thirty days, were obliged to retire with disappointed rage.

      70 (return) [ Ammianus (xvi. 2, 3) appears much better satisfied
      with the success of his first campaign than Julian himself; who
      very fairly owns that he did nothing of consequence, and that he
      fled before the enemy.]

      The conscious pride of Julian, who was indebted only to his sword
      for this signal deliverance, was imbittered by the reflection,
      that he was abandoned, betrayed, and perhaps devoted to
      destruction, by those who were bound to assist him, by every tie
      of honor and fidelity. Marcellus, master-general of the cavalry
      in Gaul, interpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the
      court, beheld with supine indifference the distress of Julian,
      and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to
      the relief of Sens. If the Cæsar had dissembled in silence so
      dangerous an insult, his person and authority would have been
      exposed to the contempt of the world; and if an action so
      criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity, the emperor
      would have confirmed the suspicions, which received a very
      specious color from his past conduct towards the princes of the
      Flavian family. Marcellus was recalled, and gently dismissed from
      his office. 71 In his room Severus was appointed general of the
      cavalry; an experienced soldier, of approved courage and
      fidelity, who could advise with respect, and execute with zeal;
      and who submitted, without reluctance to the supreme command
      which Julian, by the inrerest of his patroness Eusebia, at length
      obtained over the armies of Gaul. 72 A very judicious plan of
      operations was adopted for the approaching campaign. Julian
      himself, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of
      some new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly
      penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments, and
      carefully reestablished the fortifications of Saverne, in an
      advantageous post, which would either check the incursions, or
      intercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the same time, Barbatio,
      general of the infantry, advanced from Milan with an army of
      thirty thousand men, and passing the mountains, prepared to throw
      a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighborhood of Basil. It was
      reasonable to expect that the Alemanni, pressed on either side by
      the Roman arms, would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of
      Gaul, and to hasten to the defence of their native country. But
      the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the
      envy, or the secret instructions, of Barbatio; who acted as if he
      had been the enemy of the Cæsar, and the secret ally of the
      Barbarians. The negligence with which he permitted a troop of
      pillagers freely to pass, and to return almost before the gates
      of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the
      treasonable act of burning a number of boats, and a superfluous
      stock of provisions, which would have been of the most essential
      service to the army of Gaul, was an evidence of his hostile and
      criminal intentions. The Germans despised an enemy who appeared
      destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them; and
      the ignominious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the
      expected support; and left him to extricate himself from a
      hazardous situation, where he could neither remain with safety,
      nor retire with honor. 73

      As soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion, the
      Alemanni prepared to chastise the Roman youth, who presumed to
      dispute the possession of that country, which they claimed as
      their own by the right of conquest and of treaties. They employed
      three days, and as many nights, in transporting over the Rhine
      their military powers. The fierce Chnodomar, shaking the
      ponderous javelin which he had victoriously wielded against the
      brother of Magnentius, led the van of the Barbarians, and
      moderated by his experience the martial ardor which his example
      inspired. 74 He was followed by six other kings, by ten princes
      of regal extraction, by a long train of high-spirited nobles, and
      by thirty-five thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of
      Germany. The confidence derived from the view of their own
      strength, was increased by the intelligence which they received
      from a deserter, that the Cæsar, with a feeble army of thirteen
      thousand men, occupied a post about one-and-twenty miles from
      their camp of Strasburgh. With this inadequate force, Julian
      resolved to seek and to encounter the Barbarian host; and the
      chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and
      uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties
      of the Alemanni. The Romans marched in close order, and in two
      columns; the cavalry on the right, the infantry on the left; and
      the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the
      enemy, that Julian was desirous of deferring the battle till the
      next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their
      exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and
      food. Yielding, however, with some reluctance, to the clamors of
      the soldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted
      them to justify by their valor the eager impatience, which, in
      case of a defeat, would be universally branded with the epithets
      of rashness and presumption. The trumpets sounded, the military
      shout was heard through the field, and the two armies rushed with
      equal fury to the charge. The Cæsar, who conducted in person his
      right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers, and the
      weight of his cuirassiers. But his ranks were instantly broken by
      an irregular mixture of light horse and of light infantry, and he
      had the mortification of beholding the flight of six hundred of
      his most renowned cuirassiers. 75 The fugitives were stopped and
      rallied by the presence and authority of Julian, who, careless of
      his own safety, threw himself before them, and urging every
      motive of shame and honor, led them back against the victorious
      enemy. The conflict between the two lines of infantry was
      obstinate and bloody. The Germans possessed the superiority of
      strength and stature, the Romans that of discipline and temper;
      and as the Barbarians, who served under the standard of the
      empire, united the respective advantages of both parties, their
      strenuous efforts, guided by a skilful leader, at length
      determined the event of the day. The Romans lost four tribunes,
      and two hundred and forty-three soldiers, in this memorable
      battle of Strasburgh, so glorious to the Cæsar, 76 and so
      salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul. Six thousand of the
      Alemanni were slain in the field, without including those who
      were drowned in the Rhine, or transfixed with darts while they
      attempted to swim across the river. 77 Chnodomar himself was
      surrounded and taken prisoner, with three of his brave
      companions, who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death
      the fate of their chieftain. Julian received him with military
      pomp in the council of his officers; and expressing a generous
      pity for the fallen state, dissembled his inward contempt for the
      abject humiliation, of his captive. Instead of exhibiting the
      vanquished king of the Alemanni, as a grateful spectacle to the
      cities of Gaul, he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor
      this splendid trophy of his victory. Chnodomar experienced an
      honorable treatment: but the impatient Barbarian could not long
      survive his defeat, his confinement, and his exile. 78

      After Julian had repulsed the Alemanni from the provinces of the
      Upper Rhine, he turned his arms against the Franks, who were
      seated nearer to the ocean, on the confines of Gaul and Germany;
      and who, from their numbers, and still more from their intrepid
      valor, had ever been esteemed the most formidable of the
      Barbarians. 79 Although they were strongly actuated by the
      allurements of rapine, they professed a disinterested love of
      war; which they considered as the supreme honor and felicity of
      human nature; and their minds and bodies were so completely
      hardened by perpetual action, that, according to the lively
      expression of an orator, the snows of winter were as pleasant to
      them as the flowers of spring. In the month of December, which
      followed the battle of Strasburgh, Julian attacked a body of six
      hundred Franks, who had thrown themselves into two castles on the
      Meuse. 80 In the midst of that severe season they sustained, with
      inflexible constancy, a siege of fifty-four days; till at length,
      exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilance of the
      enemy, in breaking the ice of the river, left them no hopes of
      escape, the Franks consented, for the first time, to dispense
      with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or to die.
      The Cæsar immediately sent his captives to the court of
      Constantius, who, accepting them as a valuable present, 81
      rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the
      choicest troops of his domestic guards. The obstinate resistance
      of this handful of Franks apprised Julian of the difficulties of
      the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring, against
      the whole body of the nation. His rapid diligence surprised and
      astonished the active Barbarians. Ordering his soldiers to
      provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days, he suddenly
      pitched his camp near Tongres, while the enemy still supposed him
      in his winter quarters of Paris, expecting the slow arrival of
      his convoys from Aquitain. Without allowing the Franks to unite
      or deliberate, he skilfully spread his legions from Cologne to
      the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the success, of his
      arms, soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency,
      and to obey the commands, of their conqueror. The Chamavians
      submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the
      Rhine; but the Salians were permitted to possess their new
      establishment of Toxandria, as the subjects and auxiliaries of
      the Roman empire. 82 The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths; and
      perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the Franks,
      with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the
      conditions. An incident is related, interesting enough in itself,
      and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian, who
      ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the
      tragedy. When the Chamavians sued for peace, he required the son
      of their king, as the only hostage on whom he could rely. A
      mournful silence, interrupted by tears and groans, declared the
      sad perplexity of the Barbarians; and their aged chief lamented
      in pathetic language, that his private loss was now imbittered by
      a sense of public calamity. While the Chamavians lay prostrate at
      the foot of his throne, the royal captive, whom they believed to
      have been slain, unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and as
      soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention, the Cæsar
      addressed the assembly in the following terms: “Behold the son,
      the prince, whom you wept. You had lost him by your fault. God
      and the Romans have restored him to you. I shall still preserve
      and educate the youth, rather as a monument of my own virtue,
      than as a pledge of your sincerity. Should you presume to violate
      the faith which you have sworn, the arms of the republic will
      avenge the perfidy, not on the innocent, but on the guilty.” The
      Barbarians withdrew from his presence, impressed with the warmest
      sentiments of gratitude and admiration. 83

      _their own_ which was surrendered without resistance or toil on

      is related by Eunapius, (in Excerpt. Legationum, p. 15, 16, 17,)
      with all the amplifications of Grecian rhetoric: but the silence
      of Libanius, of Ammianus, and of Julian himself, renders the
      truth of it extremely suspicious.]

      It was not enough for Julian to have delivered the provinces of
      Gaul from the Barbarians of Germany. He aspired to emulate the
      glory of the first and most illustrious of the emperors; after
      whose example, he composed his own commentaries of the Gallic
      war. 84 Cæsar has related, with conscious pride, the manner in
      which he _twice_ passed the Rhine. Julian could boast, that
      before he assumed the title of Augustus, he had carried the Roman
      eagles beyond that great river in _three_ successful expeditions.
      85 The consternation of the Germans, after the battle of
      Strasburgh, encouraged him to the first attempt; and the
      reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence
      of a leader, who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed
      on the meanest of the soldiers. The villages on either side of
      the Meyn, which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle,
      felt the ravages of an invading army. The principal houses,
      constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance, were consumed
      by the flames; and the Cæsar boldly advanced about ten miles,
      till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest,
      undermined by subterraneous passages, which threatened with
      secret snares and ambush every step of the assailants. The ground
      was already covered with snow; and Julian, after repairing an
      ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce
      of ten months to the submissive Barbarians. At the expiration of
      the truce, Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine,
      to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire, two of the kings of
      the Alemanni, who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh.
      They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained
      alive; and as the Cæsar had procured an exact account from the
      cities and villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had
      lost, he detected every attempt to deceive him, with a degree of
      readiness and accuracy, which almost established the belief of
      his supernatural knowledge. His third expedition was still more
      splendid and important than the two former. The Germans had
      collected their military powers, and moved along the opposite
      banks of the river, with a design of destroying the bridge, and
      of preventing the passage of the Romans. But this judicious plan
      of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion. Three hundred
      light-armed and active soldiers were detached in forty small
      boats, to fall down the stream in silence, and to land at some
      distance from the posts of the enemy. They executed their orders
      with so much boldness and celerity, that they had almost
      surprised the Barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearless
      confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals.
      Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter
      and devastation, it is sufficient to observe, that Julian
      dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest
      kings of the Alemanni, three of whom were permitted to view the
      severe discipline and martial pomp of a Roman camp. Followed by
      twenty thousand captives, whom he had rescued from the chains of
      the Barbarians, the Cæsar repassed the Rhine, after terminating a
      war, the success of which has been compared to the ancient
      glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories.

      As soon as the valor and conduct of Julian had secured an
      interval of peace, he applied himself to a work more congenial to
      his humane and philosophic temper. The cities of Gaul, which had
      suffered from the inroads of the Barbarians, he diligently
      repaired; and seven important posts, between Mentz and the mouth
      of the Rhine, are particularly mentioned, as having been rebuilt
      and fortified by the order of Julian. 86 The vanquished Germans
      had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing
      and conveying the necessary materials. The active zeal of Julian
      urged the prosecution of the work; and such was the spirit which
      he had diffused among the troops, that the auxiliaries
      themselves, waiving their exemption from any duties of fatigue,
      contended in the most servile labors with the diligence of the
      Roman soldiers. It was incumbent on the Cæsar to provide for the
      subsistence, as well as for the safety, of the inhabitants and of
      the garrisons. The desertion of the former, and the mutiny of the
      latter, must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of
      famine. The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been interrupted
      by the calamities of war; but the scanty harvests of the
      continent were supplied, by his paternal care, from the plenty of
      the adjacent island. Six hundred large barks, framed in the
      forest of the Ardennes, made several voyages to the coast of
      Britain; and returning from thence, laden with corn, sailed up
      the Rhine, and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and
      fortresses along the banks of the river. 87 The arms of Julian
      had restored a free and secure navigation, which Constantinius
      had offered to purchase at the expense of his dignity, and of a
      tributary present of two thousand pounds of silver. The emperor
      parsimoniously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted
      with a lavish and trembling hand to the Barbarians. The
      dexterity, as well as the firmness, of Julian was put to a severe
      trial, when he took the field with a discontented army, which had
      already served two campaigns, without receiving any regular pay
      or any extraordinary donative. 88

      A tender regard for the peace and happiness of his subjects was
      the ruling principle which directed, or seemed to direct, the
      administration of Julian. 89 He devoted the leisure of his winter
      quarters to the offices of civil government; and affected to
      assume, with more pleasure, the character of a magistrate than
      that of a general. Before he took the field, he devolved on the
      provincial governors most of the public and private causes which
      had been referred to his tribunal; but, on his return, he
      carefully revised their proceedings, mitigated the rigor of the
      law, and pronounced a second judgment on the judges themselves.
      Superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds, an indiscreet
      and intemperate zeal for justice, he restrained, with calmness
      and dignity, the warmth of an advocate, who prosecuted, for
      extortion, the president of the Narbonnese province. “Who will
      ever be found guilty,” exclaimed the vehement Delphidius, “if it
      be enough to deny?” “And who,” replied Julian, “will ever be
      innocent, if it be sufficient to affirm?” In the general
      administration of peace and war, the interest of the sovereign is
      commonly the same as that of his people; but Constantius would
      have thought himself deeply injured, if the virtues of Julian had
      defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from
      an oppressed and exhausted country. The prince who was invested
      with the ensigns of royalty, might sometimes presume to correct
      the rapacious insolence of his inferior agents, to expose their
      corrupt arts, and to introduce an equal and easier mode of
      collection. But the management of the finances was more safely
      intrusted to Florentius, prætorian præfect of Gaul, an effeminate
      tyrant, incapable of pity or remorse: and the haughty minister
      complained of the most decent and gentle opposition, while Julian
      himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own
      behavior. The Cæsar had rejected, with abhorrence, a mandate for
      the levy of an extraordinary tax; a new superindiction, which the
      præfect had offered for his signature; and the faithful picture
      of the public misery, by which he had been obliged to justify his
      refusal, offended the court of Constantius. We may enjoy the
      pleasure of reading the sentiments of Julian, as he expresses
      them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most
      intimate friends. After stating his own conduct, he proceeds in
      the following terms: “Was it possible for the disciple of Plato
      and Aristotle to act otherwise than I have done? Could I abandon
      the unhappy subjects intrusted to my care? Was I not called upon
      to defend them from the repeated injuries of these unfeeling
      robbers? A tribune who deserts his post is punished with death,
      and deprived of the honors of burial. With what justice could I
      pronounce _his_ sentence, if, in the hour of danger, I myself
      neglected a duty far more sacred and far more important? God has
      placed me in this elevated post; his providence will guard and
      support me. Should I be condemned to suffer, I shall derive
      comfort from the testimony of a pure and upright conscience.
      Would to Heaven that I still possessed a counsellor like Sallust!
      If they think proper to send me a successor, I shall submit
      without reluctance; and had much rather improve the short
      opportunity of doing good, than enjoy a long and lasting impunity
      of evil.” 90 The precarious and dependent situation of Julian
      displayed his virtues and concealed his defects. The young hero
      who supported, in Gaul, the throne of Constantius, was not
      permitted to reform the vices of the government; but he had
      courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people.
      Unless he had been able to revive the martial spirit of the
      Romans, or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among
      their savage enemies, he could not entertain any rational hopes
      of securing the public tranquillity, either by the peace or
      conquest of Germany. Yet the victories of Julian suspended, for a
      short time, the inroads of the Barbarians, and delayed the ruin
      of the Western Empire.

      His salutary influence restored the cities of Gaul, which had
      been so long exposed to the evils of civil discord, Barbarian
      war, and domestic tyranny; and the spirit of industry was revived
      with the hopes of enjoyment. Agriculture, manufactures, and
      commerce, again flourished under the protection of the laws; and
      the _curiæ_, or civil corporations, were again filled with useful
      and respectable members: the youth were no longer apprehensive of
      marriage; and married persons were no longer apprehensive of
      posterity: the public and private festivals were celebrated with
      customary pomp; and the frequent and secure intercourse of the
      provinces displayed the image of national prosperity. 91 A mind
      like that of Julian must have felt the general happiness of which
      he was the author; but he viewed, with particular satisfaction
      and complacency, the city of Paris; the seat of his winter
      residence, and the object even of his partial affection. 92 That
      splendid capital, which now embraces an ample territory on either
      side of the Seine, was originally confined to the small island in
      the midst of the river, from whence the inhabitants derived a
      supply of pure and salubrious water. The river bathed the foot of
      the walls; and the town was accessible only by two wooden
      bridges. A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine, but
      on the south, the ground, which now bears the name of the
      University, was insensibly covered with houses, and adorned with
      a palace and amphitheatre, baths, an aqueduct, and a field of
      Mars for the exercise of the Roman troops. The severity of the
      climate was tempered by the neighborhood of the ocean; and with
      some precautions, which experience had taught, the vine and
      fig-tree were successfully cultivated. But in remarkable winters,
      the Seine was deeply frozen; and the huge pieces of ice that
      floated down the stream, might be compared, by an Asiatic, to the
      blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of
      Phrygia. The licentiousness and corruption of Antioch recalled to
      the memory of Julian the severe and simple manners of his beloved
      Lutetia; 93 where the amusements of the theatre were unknown or
      despised. He indignantly contrasted the effeminate Syrians with
      the brave and honest simplicity of the Gauls, and almost forgave
      the intemperance, which was the only stain of the Celtic
      character. 94 If Julian could now revisit the capital of France,
      he might converse with men of science and genius, capable of
      understanding and of instructing a disciple of the Greeks; he
      might excuse the lively and graceful follies of a nation, whose
      martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of
      luxury; and he must applaud the perfection of that inestimable
      art, which softens and refines and embellishes the intercourse of
      social life.

 Chapter XX: Conversion Of Constantine.—Part I.

The Motives, Progress, And Effects Of The Conversion Of
Constantine.—Legal Establishment And Constitution Of The Christian Or
Catholic Church.

The public establishment of Christianity may be considered as one of
those important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively
curiosity, and afford the most valuable instruction. The victories and
the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of
Europe; but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the
impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch; and
the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected, by an
indissoluble chain, with the opinions, the passions, and the interests
of the present generation. In the consideration of a subject which may
be examined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed with indifference,
a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature; that of
ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of
Constantine. The eloquent Lactantius, in the midst of his court, seems
impatient 1 to proclaim to the world the glorious example of the
sovereign of Gaul; who, in the first moments of his reign, acknowledged
and adored the majesty of the true and only God. 2 The learned Eusebius
has ascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign which was
displayed in the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the Italian
expedition. 3 The historian Zosimus maliciously asserts, that the
emperor had imbrued his hands in the blood of his eldest son, before he
publicly renounced the gods of Rome and of his ancestors. 4 The
perplexity produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the
behavior of Constantine himself. According to the strictness of
ecclesiastical language, the first of the _Christian_ emperors was
unworthy of that name, till the moment of his death; since it was only
during his last illness that he received, as a catechumen, the
imposition of hands, 5 and was afterwards admitted, by the initiatory
rites of baptism, into the number of the faithful. 6 The Christianity
of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified
sense; and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and
almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself
the protector, and at length the proselyte, of the church. It was an
arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education,
to acknowledge the divine power of Christ, and to understand that the
truth of _his_ revelation was incompatible with the worship of the
gods. The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind,
instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a
national religion; and he insensibly discovered his new opinions, as
far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect. During the
whole course of his reign, the stream of Christianity flowed with a
gentle, though accelerated, motion: but its general direction was
sometimes checked, and sometimes diverted, by the accidental
circumstances of the times, and by the prudence, or possibly by the
caprice, of the monarch. His ministers were permitted to signify the
intentions of their master in the various language which was best
adapted to their respective principles; 7 and he artfully balanced the
hopes and fears of his subjects, by publishing in the same year two
edicts; the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday, 8
and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices. 9
While this important revolution yet remained in suspense, the
Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with
the same anxiety, but with very opposite sentiments. The former were
prompted by every motive of zeal, as well as vanity, to exaggerate the
marks of his favor, and the evidences of his faith. The latter, till
their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment,
attempted to conceal from the world, and from themselves, that the gods
of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their
votaries. The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial
writers of the times to connect the public profession of Christianity
with the most glorious or the most ignominious æra of the reign of
Constantine.

time (Euseb. in Vit Constant. l. iv. c. 61) immediately before his
baptism and death. From the connection of these two facts, Valesius (ad
loc. Euseb.) has drawn the conclusion which is reluctantly admitted by

himself the unblushing advocate, is now feebly supported, even within
the verge of the Vatican. See the Antiquitates Christianæ, tom. ii. p.

No. 17) censures his profane conduct with truth and asperity.]

Whatever symptoms of Christian piety might transpire in the discourses
or actions of Constantine, he persevered till he was near forty years
of age in the practice of the established religion; 10 and the same
conduct which in the court of Nicomedia might be imputed to his fear,
could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of
Gaul. His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods; the
medals which issued from his Imperial mint are impressed with the
figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo, of Mars and Hercules; and
his filial piety increased the council of Olympus by the solemn
apotheosis of his father Constantius. 11 But the devotion of
Constantine was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the Sun, the
Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology; and he was pleased to be
represented with the symbols of the God of Light and Poetry. The
unerring shafts of that deity, the brightness of his eyes, his laurel
wreath, immortal beauty, and elegant accomplishments, seem to point him
out as the patron of a young hero. The altars of Apollo were crowned
with the votive offerings of Constantine; and the credulous multitude
were taught to believe, that the emperor was permitted to behold with
mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity; and that,
either walking or in a vision, he was blessed with the auspicious omens
of a long and victorious reign. The Sun was universally celebrated as
the invincible guide and protector of Constantine; and the Pagans might
reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting
vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favorite. 12

she herself was indebted to Constantine for the knowledge of
Christianity.]

which was pronounced a few months before the Italian war, abounds with
the most unexceptionable evidence of the Pagan superstition of
Constantine, and of his particular veneration for Apollo, or the Sun;
to which Julian alludes.]

As long as Constantine exercised a limited sovereignty over the
provinces of Gaul, his Christian subjects were protected by the
authority, and perhaps by the laws, of a prince, who wisely left to the
gods the care of vindicating their own honor. If we may credit the
assertion of Constantine himself, he had been an indignant spectator of
the savage cruelties which were inflicted, by the hands of Roman
soldiers, on those citizens whose religion was their only crime. 13 In
the East and in the West, he had seen the different effects of severity
and indulgence; and as the former was rendered still more odious by the
example of Galerius, his implacable enemy, the latter was recommended
to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father. The son
of Constantius immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of
persecution, and granted the free exercise of their religious
ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of
the church. They were soon encouraged to depend on the favor as well as
on the justice of their sovereign, who had imbibed a secret and sincere
reverence for the name of Christ, and for the God of the Christians. 14

be shown, that the Greek translator has improved the sense of the Latin

the days of his youth and Paganism.]

About five months after the conquest of Italy, the emperor made a
solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated
edict of Milan, which restored peace to the Catholic church. In the
personal interview of the two western princes, Constantine, by the
ascendant of genius and power, obtained the ready concurrence of his
colleague, Licinius; the union of their names and authority disarmed
the fury of Maximin; and after the death of the tyrant of the East, the
edict of Milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the
Roman world. 15

15 (return) [ Cæcilius (de Mort. Persecut. c. 48) has preserved the
Latin original; and Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. 5) has given a
Greek translation of this perpetual edict, which refers to some
provisional regulations.]

The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the
civil and religious rights of which the Christians had been so unjustly
deprived. It was enacted that the places of worship, and public lands,
which had been confiscated, should be restored to the church, without
dispute, without delay, and without expense; and this severe injunction
was accompanied with a gracious promise, that if any of the purchasers
had paid a fair and adequate price, they should be indemnified from the
Imperial treasury. The salutary regulations which guard the future
tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged
and equal toleration; and such an equality must have been interpreted
by a recent sect as an advantageous and honorable distinction. The two
emperors proclaim to the world, that they have granted a free and
absolute power to the Christians, and to all others, of following the
religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has
addicted his mind, and which he may deem the best adapted to his own
use. They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every
exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict
obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict, which was
designed to establish and secure, without any limitation, the claims of
religious liberty. They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which
have induced them to allow this universal toleration: the humane
intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people; and
the pious hope, that, by such a conduct, they shall appease and
propitiate _the Deity_, whose seat is in heaven. They gratefully
acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the
divine favor; and they trust that the same Providence will forever
continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people. From these
vague and indefinite expressions of piety, three suppositions may be
deduced, of a different, but not of an incompatible nature. The mind of
Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian
religions. According to the loose and complying notions of Polytheism,
he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as _one_ of the _many_
deities who compose the hierarchy of heaven. Or perhaps he might
embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea, that, notwithstanding the
variety of names, of rites, and of opinions, all the sects, and all the
nations of mankind, are united in the worship of the common Father and
Creator of the universe. 16

16 (return) [ A panegyric of Constantine, pronounced seven or eight
months after the edict of Milan, (see Gothofred. Chronolog. Legum, p.
7, and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 246,) uses the
following remarkable expression: “Summe rerum sator, cujus tot nomina
sant, quot linguas gentium esse voluisti, quem enim te ipse dici velin,
scire non possumus.” (Panegyr. Vet. ix. 26.) In explaining
Constantine’s progress in the faith, Mosheim (p. 971, &c.) is
ingenious, subtle, prolix.]

But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of
temporal advantage, than by considerations of abstract and speculative
truth. The partial and increasing favor of Constantine may naturally be
referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of
the Christians; and to a persuasion, that the propagation of the gospel
would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue. Whatever
latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct, whatever
indulgence he may claim for his own passions, it is undoubtedly his
interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil
obligations of society. But the operation of the wisest laws is
imperfect and precarious. They seldom inspire virtue, they cannot
always restrain vice. Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that
they condemn, nor can they always punish the actions which they
prohibit. The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the
powers of education and of opinion. But every principle which had once
maintained the vigor and purity of Rome and Sparta, was long since
extinguished in a declining and despotic empire. Philosophy still
exercised her temperate sway over the human mind, but the cause of
virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan
superstition. Under these discouraging circumstances, a prudent
magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which
diffused among the people a pure, benevolent, and universal system of
ethics, adapted to every duty and every condition of life; recommended
as the will and reason of the supreme Deity, and enforced by the
sanction of eternal rewards or punishments. The experience of Greek and
Roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national
manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine
revelation; and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the
flattering, and indeed reasonable, assurances of Lactantius. The
eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect, and almost ventured to
promise, _that_ the establishment of Christianity would restore the
innocence and felicity of the primitive age; _that_ the worship of the
true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually
considered themselves as the children of a common parent; _that_ every
impure desire, every angry or selfish passion, would be restrained by
the knowledge of the gospel; and _that_ the magistrates might sheath
the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated
by the sentiments of truth and piety, of equity and moderation, of
harmony and universal love. 17

Institut. v. 8,) who is much more perspicuous and positive than becomes

The passive and unresisting obedience, which bows under the yoke of
authority, or even of oppression, must have appeared, in the eyes of an
absolute monarch, the most conspicuous and useful of the evangelic
virtues. 18 The primitive Christians derived the institution of civil
government, not from the consent of the people, but from the decrees of
Heaven. The reigning emperor, though he had usurped the sceptre by
treason and murder, immediately assumed the sacred character of
vicegerent of the Deity. To the Deity alone he was accountable for the
abuse of his power; and his subjects were indissolubly bound, by their
oath of fidelity, to a tyrant, who had violated every law of nature and
society. The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among
wolves; and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the
defence of their religion, they should be still more criminal if they
were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow-creatures in disputing
the vain privileges, or the sordid possessions, of this transitory
life. Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle, who in the reign of Nero
had preached the duty of unconditional submission, the Christians of
the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent
of the guilt of secret conspiracy, or open rebellion. While they
experienced the rigor of persecution, they were never provoked either
to meet their tyrants in the field, or indignantly to withdraw
themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe. 19 The
Protestants of France, of Germany, and of Britain, who asserted with
such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom, have been
insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the
primitive and of the reformed Christians. 20 Perhaps, instead of
censure, some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of
our ancestors, who had convinced themselves that religion cannot
abolish the unalienable rights of human nature. 21 Perhaps the patience
of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness, as well as to
its virtue.

A sect of unwarlike plebeians, without leaders, without arms, without
fortifications, must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash
and fruitless resistance to the master of the Roman legions. But the
Christians, when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian, or solicited
the favor of Constantine, could allege, with truth and confidence, that
they held the principle of passive obedience, and that, in the space of
three centuries, their conduct had always been conformable to their
principles. They might add, that the throne of the emperors would be
established on a fixed and permanent basis, if all their subjects,
embracing the Christian doctrine, should learn to suffer and to obey.

In the general order of Providence, princes and tyrants are considered
as the ministers of Heaven, appointed to rule or to chastise the
nations of the earth. But sacred history affords many illustrious
examples of the more immediate interposition of the Deity in the
government of his chosen people. The sceptre and the sword were
committed to the hands of Moses, of Joshua, of Gideon, of David, of the
Maccabees; the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of
the divine favor, the success of their arms was destined to achieve the
deliverance or the triumph of the church. If the judges of Israel were
occasional and temporary magistrates, the kings of Judah derived from
the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and
indefeasible right, which could not be forfeited by their own vices,
nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects. The same extraordinary
providence, which was no longer confined to the Jewish people, might
elect Constantine and his family as the protectors of the Christian
world; and the devout Lactantius announces, in a prophetic tone, the
future glories of his long and universal reign. 22 Galerius and
Maximin, Maxentius and Licinius, were the rivals who shared with the
favorite of heaven the provinces of the empire. The tragic deaths of
Galerius and Maximin soon gratified the resentment, and fulfilled the
sanguine expectations, of the Christians. The success of Constantine
against Maxentius and Licinius removed the two formidable competitors
who still opposed the triumph of the second David, and his cause might
seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence. The character
of the Roman tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature; and though
the Christians might enjoy his precarious favor, they were exposed,
with the rest of his subjects, to the effects of his wanton and
capricious cruelty. The conduct of Licinius soon betrayed the
reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane
regulations of the edict of Milan. The convocation of provincial synods
was prohibited in his dominions; his Christian officers were
ignominiously dismissed; and if he avoided the guilt, or rather danger,
of a general persecution, his partial oppressions were rendered still
more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement. 23
While the East, according to the lively expression of Eusebius, was
involved in the shades of infernal darkness, the auspicious rays of
celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the West. The
piety of Constantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the
justice of his arms; and his use of victory confirmed the opinion of
the Christians, that their hero was inspired, and conducted, by the
Lord of Hosts. The conquest of Italy produced a general edict of
toleration; and as soon as the defeat of Licinius had invested
Constantine with the sole dominion of the Roman world, he immediately,
by circular letters, exhorted all his subjects to imitate, without
delay, the example of their sovereign, and to embrace the divine truth
of Christianity. 24

 Chapter XX: Conversion Of Constantine.—Part II.

The assurance that the elevation of Constantine was intimately
connected with the designs of Providence, instilled into the minds of
the Christians two opinions, which, by very different means, assisted
the accomplishment of the prophecy. Their warm and active loyalty
exhausted in his favor every resource of human industry; and they
confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by
some divine and miraculous aid. The enemies of Constantine have imputed
to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with
the Catholic church, and which apparently contributed to the success of
his ambition. In the beginning of the fourth century, the Christians
still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the
empire; but among a degenerate people, who viewed the change of masters
with the indifference of slaves, the spirit and union of a religious
party might assist the popular leader, to whose service, from a
principle of conscience, they had devoted their lives and fortunes. 25
The example of his father had instructed Constantine to esteem and to
reward the merit of the Christians; and in the distribution of public
offices, he had the advantage of strengthening his government, by the
choice of ministers or generals, in whose fidelity he could repose a
just and unreserved confidence. By the influence of these dignified
missionaries, the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in
the court and army; the Barbarians of Germany, who filled the ranks of
the legions, were of a careless temper, which acquiesced without
resistance in the religion of their commander; and when they passed the
Alps, it may fairly be presumed, that a great number of the soldiers
had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of
Constantine. 26 The habits of mankind and the interests of religion
gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed, which had so long
prevailed among the Christians; and in the councils which were
assembled under the gracious protection of Constantine, the authority
of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the
military oath, and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those
soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church. 27
While Constantine, in his own dominions, increased the number and zeal
of his faithful adherents, he could depend on the support of a powerful
faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his
rivals. A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects
of Maxentius and Licinius; and the resentment, which the latter did not
attempt to conceal, served only to engage them still more deeply in the
interest of his competitor. The regular correspondence which connected
the bishops of the most distant provinces, enabled them freely to
communicate their wishes and their designs, and to transmit without
danger any useful intelligence, or any pious contributions, which might
promote the service of Constantine, who publicly declared that he had
taken up arms for the deliverance of the church. 28

The enthusiasm which inspired the troops, and perhaps the emperor
himself, had sharpened their swords while it satisfied their
conscience. They marched to battle with the full assurance, that the
same God, who had formerly opened a passage to the Israelites through
the waters of Jordan, and had thrown down the walls of Jericho at the
sound of the trumpets of Joshua, would display his visible majesty and
power in the victory of Constantine. The evidence of ecclesiastical
history is prepared to affirm, that their expectations were justified
by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the first
Christian emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed. The real or
imaginary cause of so important an event, deserves and demands the
attention of posterity; and I shall endeavor to form a just estimate of
the famous vision of Constantine, by a distinct consideration of the
_standard_, the _dream_, and the _celestial sign;_ by separating the
historical, the natural, and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary
story, which, in the composition of a specious argument, have been
artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass.

I. An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted only on slaves
and strangers, became on object of horror in the eyes of a Roman
citizen; and the ideas of guilt, of pain, and of ignominy, were closely
united with the idea of the cross. 29 The piety, rather than the
humanity, of Constantine soon abolished in his dominions the punishment
which the Savior of mankind had condescended to suffer; 30 but the
emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education,
and of his people, before he could erect in the midst of Rome his own
statue, bearing a cross in its right hand; with an inscription which
referred the victory of his arms, and the deliverance of Rome, to the
virtue of that salutary sign, the true symbol of force and courage. 31
The same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of Constantine; the
cross glittered on their helmet, was engraved on their shields, was
interwoven into their banners; and the consecrated emblems which
adorned the person of the emperor himself, were distinguished only by
richer materials and more exquisite workmanship. 32 But the principal
standard which displayed the triumph of the cross was styled the
Labarum, 33 an obscure, though celebrated name, which has been vainly
derived from almost all the languages of the world. It is described 34
as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam. The silken veil,
which hung down from the beam, was curiously inwrought with the images
of the reigning monarch and his children. The summit of the pike
supported a crown of gold which enclosed the mysterious monogram, at
once expressive of the figure of the cross, and the initial letters, of
the name of Christ. 35 The safety of the labarum was intrusted to fifty
guards, of approved valor and fidelity; their station was marked by
honors and emoluments; and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an
opinion, that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the
execution of their office, they were secure and invulnerable amidst the
darts of the enemy. In the second civil war, Licinius felt and dreaded
the power of this consecrated banner, the sight of which, in the
distress of battle, animated the soldiers of Constantine with an
invincible enthusiasm, and scattered terror and dismay through the
ranks of the adverse legions. 36 The Christian emperors, who respected
the example of Constantine, displayed in all their military expeditions
the standard of the cross; but when the degenerate successors of
Theodosius had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies,
the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the
palace of Constantinople. 37 Its honors are still preserved on the
medals of the Flavian family. Their grateful devotion has placed the
monogram of Christ in the midst of the ensigns of Rome. The solemn
epithets of, safety of the republic, glory of the army, restoration of
public happiness, are equally applied to the religious and military
trophies; and there is still extant a medal of the emperor Constantius,
where the standard of the labarum is accompanied with these memorable
words, BY THIS SIGN THOU SHALT CONQUER. 38

II. In all occasions of danger and distress, it was the practice of the
primitive Christians to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of
the cross, which they used, in all their ecclesiastical rites, in all
the daily occurrences of life, as an infallible preservative against
every species of spiritual or temporal evil. 39 The authority of the
church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion
of Constantine, who in the same prudent and gradual progress
acknowledged the truth, and assumed the symbol, of Christianity. But
the testimony of a contemporary writer, who in a formal treatise has
avenged the cause of religion, bestows on the piety of the emperor a
more awful and sublime character. He affirms, with the most perfect
confidence, that in the night which preceded the last battle against
Maxentius, Constantine was admonished in a dream 39a to inscribe the
shields of his soldiers with the _celestial sign of God_, the sacred
monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the commands of
Heaven, and that his valor and obedience were rewarded by the decisive
victory of the Milvian Bridge. Some considerations might perhaps
incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the
rhetorician, whose pen, either from zeal or interest, was devoted to
the cause of the prevailing faction. 40 He appears to have published
his deaths of the persecutors at Nicomedia about three years after the
Roman victory; but the interval of a thousand miles, and a thousand
days, will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers, the
credulity of party, and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself
who might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale, which
exalted his fame, and promoted his designs. In favor of Licinius, who
still dissembled his animosity to the Christians, the same author has
provided a similar vision, of a form of prayer, which was communicated
by an angel, and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the
legions of the tyrant Maximin. The frequent repetition of miracles
serves to provoke, where it does not subdue, the reason of mankind; 41
but if the dream of Constantine is separately considered, it may be
naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the
emperor. Whilst his anxiety for the approaching day, which must decide
the fate of the empire, was suspended by a short and interrupted
slumber, the venerable form of Christ, and the well-known symbol of his
religion, might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a
prince who reverenced the name, and had perhaps secretly implored the
power, of the God of the Christians. As readily might a consummate
statesman indulge himself in the use of one of those military
stratagems, one of those pious frauds, which Philip and Sertorius had
employed with such art and effect. 42 The præternatural origin of
dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity, and a
considerable part of the Gallic army was already prepared to place
their confidence in the salutary sign of the Christian religion. The
secret vision of Constantine could be disproved only by the event; and
the intrepid hero who had passed the Alps and the Apennine, might view
with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of
Rome. The senate and people, exulting in their own deliverance from an
odious tyrant, acknowledged that the victory of Constantine surpassed
the powers of man, without daring to insinuate that it had been
obtained by the protection of the _Gods_. The triumphal arch, which was
erected about three years after the event, proclaims, in ambiguous
language, that by the greatness of his own mind, and by an _instinct_
or impulse of the Divinity, he had saved and avenged the Roman
republic. 43 The Pagan orator, who had seized an earlier opportunity of
celebrating the virtues of the conqueror, supposes that he alone
enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being, who
delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities; and thus
assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of Constantine should
not presume to embrace the new religion of their sovereign. 44

III. The philosopher, who with calm suspicion examines the dreams and
omens, the miracles and prodigies, of profane or even of ecclesiastical
history, will probably conclude, that if the eyes of the spectators
have sometimes been deceived by fraud, the understanding of the readers
has much more frequently been insulted by fiction. Every event, or
appearance, or accident, which seems to deviate from the ordinary
course of nature, has been rashly ascribed to the immediate action of
the Deity; and the astonished fancy of the multitude has sometimes
given shape and color, language and motion, to the fleeting but
uncommon meteors of the air. 45 Nazarius and Eusebius are the two most
celebrated orators, who, in studied panegyrics, have labored to exalt
the glory of Constantine. Nine years after the Roman victory, Nazarius
46 describes an army of divine warriors, who seemed to fall from the
sky: he marks their beauty, their spirit, their gigantic forms, the
stream of light which beamed from their celestial armor, their patience
in suffering themselves to be heard, as well as seen, by mortals; and
their declaration that they were sent, that they flew, to the
assistance of the great Constantine. For the truth of this prodigy, the
Pagan orator appeals to the whole Gallic nation, in whose presence he
was then speaking; and seems to hope that the ancient apparitions 47
would now obtain credit from this recent and public event. The
Christian fable of Eusebius, which, in the space of twenty-six years,
might arise from the original dream, is cast in a much more correct and
elegant mould. In one of the marches of Constantine, he is reported to
have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the cross, placed
above the meridian sun and inscribed with the following words: BY THIS
CONQUER. This amazing object in the sky astonished the whole army, as
well as the emperor himself, who was yet undetermined in the choice of
a religion: but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision
of the ensuing night. Christ appeared before his eyes; and displaying
the same celestial sign of the cross, he directed Constantine to frame
a similar standard, and to march, with an assurance of victory, against
Maxentius and all his enemies. 48 The learned bishop of Cæsarea appears
to be sensible, that the recent discovery of this marvellous anecdote
would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his
readers. Yet, instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time
and place, which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth;
49 instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living
witnesses who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle; 50
Eusebius contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony; that
of the deceased Constantine, who, many years after the event, in the
freedom of conversation, had related to him this extraordinary incident
of his own life, and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath. The
prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect
the veracity of his victorious master; but he plainly intimates, that
in a fact of such a nature, he should have refused his assent to any
meaner authority. This motive of credibility could not survive the
power of the Flavian family; and the celestial sign, which the Infidels
might afterwards deride, 51 was disregarded by the Christians of the
age which immediately followed the conversion of Constantine. 52 But
the Catholic church, both of the East and of the West, has adopted a
prodigy which favors, or seems to favor, the popular worship of the
cross. The vision of Constantine maintained an honorable place in the
legend of superstition, till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism
presumed to depreciate the triumph, and to arraign the truth, of the
first Christian emperor. 53

53 (return) [ Godefroy was the first, who, in the year 1643, (Not ad

which had been supported with equal zeal by Cardinal Baronius, and the
Centuriators of Magdeburgh. Since that time, many of the Protestant
critics have inclined towards doubt and disbelief. The objections are
urged, with great force, by M. Chauffepié, (Dictionnaire Critique, tom.
iv. p. 6–11;) and, in the year 1774, a doctor of Sorbonne, the Abbé du
Voisin published an apology, which deserves the praise of learning and
moderation. * Note: The first Excursus of Heinichen (in Vitam
Constantini, p. 507) contains a full summary of the opinions and
arguments of the later writers who have discussed this interminable
subject. As to his conversion, where interest and inclination, state
policy, and, if not a sincere conviction of its truth, at least a
respect, an esteem, an awe of Christianity, thus coincided, Constantine
himself would probably have been unable to trace the actual history of
the workings of his own mind, or to assign its real influence to each
concurrent motive.—M]

The Protestant and philosophic readers of the present age will incline
to believe, that in the account of his own conversion, Constantine
attested a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury. They
may not hesitate to pronounce, that in the choice of a religion, his
mind was determined only by a sense of interest; and that (according to
the expression of a profane poet) 54 he used the altars of the church
as a convenient footstool to the throne of the empire. A conclusion so
harsh and so absolute is not, however, warranted by our knowledge of
human nature, of Constantine, or of Christianity. In an age of
religious fervor, the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some
part of the enthusiasm which they inspire, and the most orthodox saints
assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of truth by the
arms of deceit and falsehood.

Personal interest is often the standard of our belief, as well as of
our practice; and the same motives of temporal advantage which might
influence the public conduct and professions of Constantine, would
insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his
fame and fortunes. His vanity was gratified by the flattering
assurance, that _he_ had been chosen by Heaven to reign over the earth;
success had justified his divine title to the throne, and that title
was founded on the truth of the Christian revelation. As real virtue is
sometimes excited by undeserved applause, the specious piety of
Constantine, if at first it was only specious, might gradually, by the
influence of praise, of habit, and of example, be matured into serious
faith and fervent devotion. The bishops and teachers of the new sect,
whose dress and manners had not qualified them for the residence of a
court, were admitted to the Imperial table; they accompanied the
monarch in his expeditions; and the ascendant which one of them, an
Egyptian or a Spaniard, 55 acquired over his mind, was imputed by the
Pagans to the effect of magic. 56 Lactantius, who has adorned the
precepts of the gospel with the eloquence of Cicero, 57 and Eusebius,
who has consecrated the learning and philosophy of the Greeks to the
service of religion, 58 were both received into the friendship and
familiarity of their sovereign; and those able masters of controversy
could patiently watch the soft and yielding moments of persuasion, and
dexterously apply the arguments which were the best adapted to his
character and understanding. Whatever advantages might be derived from
the acquisition of an Imperial proselyte, he was distinguished by the
splendor of his purple, rather than by the superiority of wisdom, or
virtue, from the many thousands of his subjects who had embraced the
doctrines of Christianity. Nor can it be deemed incredible, that the
mind of an unlettered soldier should have yielded to the weight of
evidence, which, in a more enlightened age, has satisfied or subdued
the reason of a Grotius, a Pascal, or a Locke. In the midst of the
incessant labors of his great office, this soldier employed, or
affected to employ, the hours of the night in the diligent study of the
Scriptures, and the composition of theological discourses; which he
afterwards pronounced in the presence of a numerous and applauding
audience. In a very long discourse, which is still extant, the royal
preacher expatiates on the various proofs still extant, the royal
preacher expatiates on the various proofs of religion; but he dwells
with peculiar complacency on the Sibylline verses, 59 and the fourth
eclogue of Virgil. 60 Forty years before the birth of Christ, the
Mantuan bard, as if inspired by the celestial muse of Isaiah, had
celebrated, with all the pomp of oriental metaphor, the return of the
Virgin, the fall of the serpent, the approaching birth of a godlike
child, the offspring of the great Jupiter, who should expiate the guilt
of human kind, and govern the peaceful universe with the virtues of his
father; the rise and appearance of a heavenly race, primitive nation
throughout the world; and the gradual restoration of the innocence and
felicity of the golden age. The poet was perhaps unconscious of the
secret sense and object of these sublime predictions, which have been
so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul, or a triumvir; 61
but if a more splendid, and indeed specious interpretation of the
fourth eclogue contributed to the conversion of the first Christian
emperor, Virgil may deserve to be ranked among the most successful
missionaries of the gospel. 62

 Chapter XX: Conversion Of Constantine.—Part III.

The awful mysteries of the Christian faith and worship were concealed
from the eyes of strangers, and even of catechu mens, with an affected
secrecy, which served to excite their wonder and curiosity. 63 But the
severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had
instituted, were relaxed by the same prudence in favor of an Imperial
proselyte, whom it was so important to allure, by every gentle
condescension, into the pale of the church; and Constantine was
permitted, at least by a tacit dispensation, to enjoy _most_ of the
privileges, before he had contracted _any_ of the obligations, of a
Christian. Instead of retiring from the congregation, when the voice of
the deacon dismissed the profane multitude, he prayed with the
faithful, disputed with the bishops, preached on the most sublime and
intricate subjects of theology, celebrated with sacred rites the vigil
of Easter, and publicly declared himself, not only a partaker, but, in
some measure, a priest and hierophant of the Christian mysteries. 64
The pride of Constantine might assume, and his services had deserved,
some extraordinary distinction: and ill-timed rigor might have blasted
the unripened fruits of his conversion; and if the doors of the church
had been strictly closed against a prince who had deserted the altars
of the gods, the master of the empire would have been left destitute of
any form of religious worship. In his last visit to Rome, he piously
disclaimed and insulted the superstition of his ancestors, by refusing
to lead the military procession of the equestrian order, and to offer
the public vows to the Jupiter of the Capitoline Hill. 65 Many years
before his baptism and death, Constantine had proclaimed to the world,
that neither his person nor his image should ever more be seen within
the walls of an idolatrous temple; while he distributed through the
provinces a variety of medals and pictures, which represented the
emperor in an humble and suppliant posture of Christian devotion. 66

The pride of Constantine, who refused the privileges of a catechumen,
cannot easily be explained or excused; but the delay of his baptism may
be justified by the maxims and the practice of ecclesiastical
antiquity. The sacrament of baptism 67 was regularly administered by
the bishop himself, with his assistant clergy, in the cathedral church
of the diocese, during the fifty days between the solemn festivals of
Easter and Pentecost; and this holy term admitted a numerous band of
infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church. The discretion
of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they
could understand the obligations which they contracted: the severity of
ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a novitiate of two or
three years; and the catechumens themselves, from different motives of
a temporal or a spiritual nature, were seldom impatient to assume the
character of perfect and initiated Christians. The sacrament of baptism
was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and the
soul was instantly restored to its original purity, and entitled to the
promise of eternal salvation. Among the proselytes of Christianity,
there are many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite,
which could not be repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege,
which could never be recovered. By the delay of their baptism, they
could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyments of
this world, while they still retained in their own hands the means of a
sure and easy absolution. 68 The sublime theory of the gospel had made
a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of
Constantine himself. He pursued the great object of his ambition
through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy; and, after the
victory, he abandoned himself, without moderation, to the abuse of his
fortune. Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect
heroism and profane philosophy of Trajan and the Antonines, the mature
age of Constantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in
his youth. As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth, he
proportionally declined in the practice of virtue; and the same year of
his reign in which he convened the council of Nice, was polluted by the
execution, or rather murder, of his eldest son. This date is alone
sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious suggestions of Zosimus,
69 who affirms, that, after the death of Crispus, the remorse of his
father accepted from the ministers of christianity the expiation which
he had vainly solicited from the Pagan pontiffs. At the time of the
death of Crispus, the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of
a religion; he could no longer be ignorant that the church was
possessed of an infallible remedy, though he chose to defer the
application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation
and danger of a relapse. The bishops whom he summoned, in his last
illness, to the palace of Nicomedia, were edified by the fervor with
which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism, by the solemn
protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a
disciple of Christ, and by his humble refusal to wear the Imperial
purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a Neophyte.
The example and reputation of Constantine seemed to countenance the
delay of baptism. 70 Future tyrants were encouraged to believe, that
the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would
instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse
of religion dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue.

67 (return) [ The theory and practice of antiquity, with regard to the
sacrament of baptism, have been copiously explained by Dom Chardon,
Hist. des Sacremens, tom. i. p. 3-405; Dom Martenne de Ritibus Ecclesiæ
Antiquis, tom. i.; and by Bingham, in the tenth and eleventh books of
his Christian Antiquities. One circumstance may be observed, in which
the modern churches have materially departed from the ancient custom.
The sacrament of baptism (even when it was administered to infants) was
immediately followed by confirmation and the holy communion.]

68 (return) [ The Fathers, who censured this criminal delay, could not
deny the certain and victorious efficacy even of a death-bed baptism.
The ingenious rhetoric of Chrysostom could find only three arguments
against these prudent Christians. 1. That we should love and pursue
virtue for her own sake, and not merely for the reward. 2. That we may
be surprised by death without an opportunity of baptism. 3. That
although we shall be placed in heaven, we shall only twinkle like
little stars, when compared to the suns of righteousness who have run
their appointed course with labor, with success, and with glory.
Chrysos tom in Epist. ad Hebræos, Homil. xiii. apud Chardon, Hist. des
Sacremens, tom. i. p. 49. I believe that this delay of baptism, though
attended with the most pernicious consequences, was never condemned by
any general or provincial council, or by any public act or declaration
of the church. The zeal of the bishops was easily kindled on much
slighter occasion. * Note: This passage of Chrysostom, though not in
his more forcible manner, is not quite fairly represented. He is
stronger in other places, in Act. Hom. xxiii.—and Hom. i. Compare,
likewise, the sermon of Gregory of Nysea on this subject, and Gregory
Nazianzen. After all, to those who believed in the efficacy of baptism,
what argument could be more conclusive, than the danger of dying
without it? Orat. xl.—M.]

passage of Zosimus, has shown decisively that this malicious way of
accounting for the conversion of Constantine was not an invention of
Zosimus. It appears to have been the current calumny eagerly adopted
and propagated by the exasperated Pagan party. Reitemeter, a later
editor of Zosimus, whose notes are retained in the recent edition, in
the collection of the Byzantine historians, has a disquisition on the
passage, as candid, but not more conclusive than some which have
preceded him—M.]

70 (return) [ Eusebius, l. iv. c. 61, 62, 63. The bishop of Cæsarea

The gratitude of the church has exalted the virtues and excused the
failings of a generous patron, who seated Christianity on the throne of
the Roman world; and the Greeks, who celebrate the festival of the
Imperial saint, seldom mention the name of Constantine without adding
the title of _equal to the Apostles_. 71 Such a comparison, if it
allude to the character of those divine missionaries, must be imputed
to the extravagance of impious flattery. But if the parallel be
confined to the extent and number of their evangelic victories the
success of Constantine might perhaps equal that of the Apostles
themselves. By the edicts of toleration, he removed the temporal
disadvantages which had hitherto retarded the progress of Christianity;
and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission, a
liberal encouragement, to recommend the salutary truths of revelation
by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind.
The exact balance of the two religions continued but a moment; and the
piercing eye of ambition and avarice soon discovered, that the
profession of Christianity might contribute to the interest of the
present, as well as of a future life. 72 The hopes of wealth and
honors, the example of an emperor, his exhortations, his irresistible
smiles, diffused conviction among the venal and obsequious crowds which
usually fill the apartments of a palace. The cities which signalized a
forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their temples, were
distinguished by municipal privileges, and rewarded with popular
donatives; and the new capital of the East gloried in the singular
advantage that Constantinople was never profaned by the worship of
idols. 73 As the lower ranks of society are governed by imitation, the
conversion of those who possessed any eminence of birth, of power, or
of riches, was soon followed by dependent multitudes. 74 The salvation
of the common people was purchased at an easy rate, if it be true that,
in one year, twelve thousand men were baptized at Rome, besides a
proportionable number of women and children, and that a white garment,
with twenty pieces of gold, had been promised by the emperor to every
convert. 75 The powerful influence of Constantine was not circumscribed
by the narrow limits of his life, or of his dominions. The education
which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race
of princes, whose faith was still more lively and sincere, as they
imbibed, in their earliest infancy, the spirit, or at least the
doctrine, of Christianity. War and commerce had spread the knowledge of
the gospel beyond the confines of the Roman provinces; and the
Barbarians, who had disdained as humble and proscribed sect, soon
learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the
greatest monarch, and the most civilized nation, of the globe. 76 The
Goths and Germans, who enlisted under the standard of Rome, revered the
cross which glittered at the head of the legions, and their fierce
countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of
humanity. The kings of Iberia and Armenia76a worshipped the god of
their protector; and their subjects, who have invariably preserved the
name of Christians, soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with
their Roman brethren. The Christians of Persia were suspected, in time
of war, of preferring their religion to their country; but as long as
peace subsisted between the two empires, the persecuting spirit of the
Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine. 77
The rays of the gospel illuminated the coast of India. The colonies of
Jews, who had penetrated into Arabia and Ethiopia, 78 opposed the
progress of Christianity; but the labor of the missionaries was in some
measure facilitated by a previous knowledge of the Mosaic revelation;
and Abyssinia still reveres the memory of Frumentius, 78a who, in the
time of Constantine, devoted his life to the conversion of those
sequestered regions. Under the reign of his son Constantius,
Theophilus, 79 who was himself of Indian extraction, was invested with
the double character of ambassador and bishop. He embarked on the Red
Sea with two hundred horses of the purest breed of Cappadocia, which
were sent by the emperor to the prince of the Sabæans, or Homerites.
Theophilus was intrusted with many other useful or curious presents,
which might raise the admiration, and conciliate the friendship, of the
Barbarians; and he successfully employed several years in a pastoral
visit to the churches of the torrid zone. 80

The irresistible power of the Roman emperors was displayed in the
important and dangerous change of the national religion. The terrors of
a military force silenced the faint and unsupported murmurs of the
Pagans, and there was reason to expect, that the cheerful submission of
the Christian clergy, as well as people, would be the result of
conscience and gratitude. It was long since established, as a
fundamental maxim of the Roman constitution, that every rank of
citizens was alike subject to the laws, and that the care of religion
was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate. Constantine and
his successors could not easily persuade themselves that they had
forfeited, by their conversion, any branch of the Imperial
prerogatives, or that they were incapable of giving laws to a religion
which they had protected and embraced. The emperors still continued to
exercise a supreme jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical order, and the
sixteenth book of the Theodosian code represents, under a variety of
titles, the authority which they assumed in the government of the
Catholic church. But the distinction of the spiritual and temporal
powers, 81 which had never been imposed on the free spirit of Greece
and Rome, was introduced and confirmed by the legal establishment of
Christianity. The office of supreme pontiff, which, from the time of
Numa to that of Augustus, had always been exercised by one of the most
eminent of the senators, was at length united to the Imperial dignity.
The first magistrate of the state, as often as he was prompted by
superstition or policy, performed with his own hands the sacerdotal
functions; 82 nor was there any order of priests, either at Rome or in
the provinces, who claimed a more sacred character among men, or a more
intimate communication with the gods. But in the Christian church,
which instrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of
consecrated ministers, the monarch, whose spiritual rank is less
honorable than that of the meanest deacon, was seated below the rails
of the sanctuary, and confounded with the rest of the faithful
multitude. 83 The emperor might be saluted as the father of his people,
but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church;
and the same marks of respect, which Constantine had paid to the
persons of saints and confessors, were soon exacted by the pride of the
episcopal order. 84 A secret conflict between the civil and
ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrassed the operation of the Roman
government; and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of
touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant. The separation of
men into the two orders of the clergy and of the laity was, indeed,
familiar to many nations of antiquity; and the priests of India, of
Persia, of Assyria, of Judea, of Æthiopia, of Egypt, and of Gaul,
derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions
which they had acquired. These venerable institutions had gradually
assimilated themselves to the manners and government of their
respective countries; 85 but the opposition or contempt of the civil
power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church. The
Christians had been obliged to elect their own magistrates, to raise
and distribute a peculiar revenue, and to regulate the internal policy
of their republic by a code of laws, which were ratified by the consent
of the people and the practice of three hundred years. When Constantine
embraced the faith of the Christians, he seemed to contract a perpetual
alliance with a distinct and independent society; and the privileges
granted or confirmed by that emperor, or by his successors, were
accepted, not as the precarious favors of the court, but as the just
and inalienable rights of the ecclesiastical order.

The Catholic church was administered by the spiritual and legal
jurisdiction of eighteen hundred bishops; 86 of whom one thousand were
seated in the Greek, and eight hundred in the Latin, provinces of the
empire. The extent and boundaries of their respective dioceses had been
variously and accidentally decided by the zeal and success of the first
missionaries, by the wishes of the people, and by the propagation of
the gospel. Episcopal churches were closely planted along the banks of
the Nile, on the sea-coast of Africa, in the proconsular Asia, and
through the southern provinces of Italy. The bishops of Gaul and Spain,
of Thrace and Pontus, reigned over an ample territory, and delegated
their rural suffragans to execute the subordinate duties of the
pastoral office. 87 A Christian diocese might be spread over a
province, or reduced to a village; but all the bishops possessed an
equal and indelible character: they all derived the same powers and
privileges from the apostles, from the people, and from the laws. While
the _civil_ and _military_ professions were separated by the policy of
Constantine, a new and perpetual order of _ecclesiastical_ ministers,
always respectable, sometimes dangerous, was established in the church
and state. The important review of their station and attributes may be
distributed under the following heads: I. Popular Election. II.
Ordination of the Clergy. III. Property. IV. Civil Jurisdiction. V.
Spiritual censures. VI. Exercise of public oratory. VII. Privilege of
legislative assemblies.

of the prelates, was abolished before the end of the tenth, both in the
East and the West.]

I. The freedom of election subsisted long after the legal establishment
of Christianity; 88 and the subjects of Rome enjoyed in the church the
privilege which they had lost in the republic, of choosing the
magistrates whom they were bound to obey. As soon as a bishop had
closed his eyes, the metropolitan issued a commission to one of his
suffragans to administer the vacant see, and prepare, within a limited
time, the future election. The right of voting was vested in the
inferior clergy, who were best qualified to judge of the merit of the
candidates; in the senators or nobles of the city, all those who were
distinguished by their rank or property; and finally in the whole body
of the people, who, on the appointed day, flocked in multitudes from
the most remote parts of the diocese, 89 and sometimes silenced by
their tumultuous acclamations, the voice of reason and the laws of
discipline. These acclamations might accidentally fix on the head of
the most deserving competitor; of some ancient presbyter, some holy
monk, or some layman, conspicuous for his zeal and piety. But the
episcopal chair was solicited, especially in the great and opulent
cities of the empire, as a temporal rather than as a spiritual dignity.
The interested views, the selfish and angry passions, the arts of
perfidy and dissimulation, the secret corruption, the open and even
bloody violence which had formerly disgraced the freedom of election in
the commonwealths of Greece and Rome, too often influenced the choice
of the successors of the apostles. While one of the candidates boasted
the honors of his family, a second allured his judges by the delicacies
of a plentiful table, and a third, more guilty than his rivals, offered
to share the plunder of the church among the accomplices of his
sacrilegious hopes 90 The civil as well as ecclesiastical laws
attempted to exclude the populace from this solemn and important
transaction. The canons of ancient discipline, by requiring several
episcopal qualifications, of age, station, &c., restrained, in some
measure, the indiscriminate caprice of the electors. The authority of
the provincial bishops, who were assembled in the vacant church to
consecrate the choice of the people, was interposed to moderate their
passions and to correct their mistakes. The bishops could refuse to
ordain an unworthy candidate, and the rage of contending factions
sometimes accepted their impartial mediation. The submission, or the
resistance, of the clergy and people, on various occasions, afforded
different precedents, which were insensibly converted into positive
laws and provincial customs; 91 but it was every where admitted, as a
fundamental maxim of religious policy, that no bishop could be imposed
on an orthodox church, without the consent of its members. The
emperors, as the guardians of the public peace, and as the first
citizens of Rome and Constantinople, might effectually declare their
wishes in the choice of a primate; but those absolute monarchs
respected the freedom of ecclesiastical elections; and while they
distributed and resumed the honors of the state and army, they allowed
eighteen hundred perpetual magistrates to receive their important
offices from the free suffrages of the people. 92 It was agreeable to
the dictates of justice, that these magistrates should not desert an
honorable station from which they could not be removed; but the wisdom
of councils endeavored, without much success, to enforce the residence,
and to prevent the translation, of bishops. The discipline of the West
was indeed less relaxed than that of the East; but the same passions
which made those regulations necessary, rendered them ineffectual. The
reproaches which angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each
other, serve only to expose their common guilt, and their mutual
indiscretion.

Cyprian, that even in his time, no priest could be elected without the
consent of the community. (Ep. 68,) that election was far from being
altogether free. The bishop proposed to his parishioners the candidate
whom he had chosen, and they were permitted to make such objections as
might be suggested by his conduct and morals. (St. Cyprian, Ep. 33.)

II. The bishops alone possessed the faculty of _spiritual_ generation:
and this extraordinary privilege might compensate, in some degree, for
the painful celibacy 93 which was imposed as a virtue, as a duty, and
at length as a positive obligation. The religions of antiquity, which
established a separate order of priests, dedicated a holy race, a tribe
or family, to the perpetual service of the gods. 94 Such institutions
were founded for possession, rather than conquest. The children of the
priests enjoyed, with proud and indolent security, their sacred
inheritance; and the fiery spirit of enthusiasm was abated by the
cares, the pleasures, and the endearments of domestic life. But the
Christian sanctuary was open to every ambitious candidate, who aspired
to its heavenly promises or temporal possessions. This office of
priests, like that of soldiers or magistrates, was strenuously
exercised by those men, whose temper and abilities had prompted them to
embrace the ecclesiastical profession, or who had been selected by a
discerning bishop, as the best qualified to promote the glory and
interest of the church. The bishops 95 (till the abuse was restrained
by the prudence of the laws) might constrain the reluctant, and protect
the distressed; and the imposition of hands forever bestowed some of
the most valuable privileges of civil society. The whole body of the
Catholic clergy, more numerous perhaps than the legions, was exempted
[95a] by the emperors from all service, private or public, all
municipal offices, and all personal taxes and contributions, which
pressed on their fellow- citizens with intolerable weight; and the
duties of their holy profession were accepted as a full discharge of
their obligations to the republic. 96 Each bishop acquired an absolute
and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of the clerk whom he
ordained: the clergy of each episcopal church, with its dependent
parishes, formed a regular and permanent society; and the cathedrals of
Constantinople 97 and Carthage 98 maintained their peculiar
establishment of five hundred ecclesiastical ministers. Their ranks 99
and numbers were insensibly multiplied by the superstition of the
times, which introduced into the church the splendid ceremonies of a
Jewish or Pagan temple; and a long train of priests, deacons,
sub-deacons, acolythes, exorcists, readers, singers, and doorkeepers,
contributed, in their respective stations, to swell the pomp and
harmony of religious worship. The clerical name and privileges were
extended to many pious fraternities, who devoutly supported the
ecclesiastical throne. 100 Six hundred _parabolani_, or adventurers,
visited the sick at Alexandria; eleven hundred _copiatæ_, or
grave-diggers, buried the dead at Constantinople; and the swarms of
monks, who arose from the Nile, overspread and darkened the face of the
Christian world.

partial critics, one half of the truth is produced, and the other is
concealed.—Note: Compare Planck, (vol. i. p. 348.) This century, the
third, first brought forth the monks, or the spirit of monkery, the
celibacy of the clergy. Planck likewise observes, that from the history
of Eusebius alone, names of married bishops and presbyters may be
adduced by dozens.—M.]

magi are described by Ammianus as a very numerous family: “Per sæcula

cultibus dedicata.” (xxiii. 6.) Ausonius celebrates the _Stirps

Antiquities, more especially the 4th, 6th, and 7th chapters.) When the
brother of St. Jerom was ordained in Cyprus, the deacons forcibly
stopped his mouth, lest he should make a solemn protestation, which
might invalidate the holy rites.]

 [ This exemption was very much limited. The municipal offices were of
 two kinds; the one attached to the individual in his character of
 inhabitant, the other in that of _proprietor_. Constantine had
 exempted ecclesiastics from offices of the first description. (Cod.
 Theod. xvi. t. ii. leg. 1, 2 Eusebius, Hist. Eccles. l. x. c. vii.)
 They sought, also, to be exempted from those of the second, (munera
 patrimoniorum.) The rich, to obtain this privilege, obtained
 subordinate situations among the clergy. Constantine published in 320
 an edict, by which he prohibited the more opulent citizens (decuriones
 and curiales) from embracing the ecclesiastical profession, and the
 bishops from admitting new ecclesiastics, before a place should be
 vacant by the death of the occupant, (Godefroy ad Cod. Theod.t. xii.
 t. i. de Decur.) Valentinian the First, by a rescript still more
 general enacted that no rich citizen should obtain a situation in the
 church, (De Episc 1. lxvii.) He also enacted that ecclesiastics, who
 wished to be exempt from offices which they were bound to discharge as
 proprietors, should be obliged to give up their property to their
 relations. Cod Theodos l. xii t. i. leb. 49—G.]

 Chapter XX: Conversion Of Constantine.—Part IV.

III. The edict of Milan secured the revenue as well as the peace of the
church. 101 The Christians not only recovered the lands and houses of
which they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of Diocletian, but
they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had
hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate. As soon as
Christianity became the religion of the emperor and the empire, the
national clergy might claim a decent and honorable maintenance; and the
payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more
oppressive tribute, which superstition imposes on her votaries. But as
the wants and expenses of the church increased with her prosperity, the
ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary
oblations of the faithful. Eight years after the edict of Milan,
Constantine granted to all his subjects the free and universal
permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy Catholic church;
102 and their devout liberality, which during their lives was checked
by luxury or avarice, flowed with a profuse stream at the hour of their
death. The wealthy Christians were encouraged by the example of their
sovereign. An absolute monarch, who is rich without patrimony, may be
charitable without merit; and Constantine too easily believed that he
should purchase the favor of Heaven, if he maintained the idle at the
expense of the industrious; and distributed among the saints the wealth
of the republic. The same messenger who carried over to Africa the head
of Maxentius, might be intrusted with an epistle to Cæcilian, bishop of
Carthage. The emperor acquaints him, that the treasurers of the
province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of three thousand
_folles_, or eighteen thousand pounds sterling, and to obey his further
requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa, Numidia, and
Mauritania. 103 The liberality of Constantine increased in a just
proportion to his faith, and to his vices. He assigned in each city a
regular allowance of corn, to supply the fund of ecclesiastical
charity; and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life
became the peculiar favorites of their sovereign. The Christian temples
of Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Constantinople &c., displayed the
ostentatious piety of a prince, ambitious in a declining age to equal
the perfect labors of antiquity. 104 The form of these religious
edifices was simple and oblong; though they might sometimes swell into
the shape of a dome, and sometimes branch into the figure of a cross.
The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus; the
roof was covered with tiles, perhaps of gilt brass; and the walls, the
columns, the pavement, were encrusted with variegated marbles. The most
precious ornaments of gold and silver, of silk and gems, were profusely
dedicated to the service of the altar; and this specious magnificence
was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property. In
the space of two centuries, from the reign of Constantine to that of
Justinian, the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by
the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people. An annual
income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the
bishops, who were placed at an equal distance between riches and
poverty, 105 but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the
dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed. An authentic
but imperfect 106 rent-roll specifies some houses, shops, gardens, and
farms, which belonged to the three _Basilicæ_ of Rome, St. Peter, St.
Paul, and St. John Lateran, in the provinces of Italy, Africa, and the
East. They produce, besides a reserved rent of oil, linen, paper,
aromatics, &c., a clear annual revenue of twenty-two thousand pieces of
gold, or twelve thousand pounds sterling. In the age of Constantine and
Justinian, the bishops no longer possessed, perhaps they no longer
deserved, the unsuspecting confidence of their clergy and people. The
ecclesiastical revenues of each diocese were divided into four parts
for the respective uses of the bishop himself, of his inferior clergy,
of the poor, and of the public worship; and the abuse of this sacred
trust was strictly and repeatedly checked. 107 The patrimony of the
church was still subject to all the public compositions of the state.
108 The clergy of Rome, Alexandria, Chessaionica, &c., might solicit
and obtain some partial exemptions; but the premature attempt of the
great council of Rimini, which aspired to universal freedom, was
successfully resisted by the son of Constantine. 109

IV. The Latin clergy, who erected their tribunal on the ruins of the
civil and common law, have modestly accepted, as the gift of
Constantine, 110 the independent jurisdiction, which was the fruit of
time, of accident, and of their own industry. But the liberality of the
Christian emperors had actually endowed them with some legal
prerogatives, which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character. 111
1. Under a despotic government, the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted
the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their _peers_, and
even in a capital accusation, a synod of their brethren were the sole
judges of their guilt or innocence. Such a tribunal, unless it was
inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord, might be
favorable, or even partial, to the sacerdotal order: but Constantine
was satisfied, 112 that secret impunity would be less pernicious than
public scandal: and the Nicene council was edited by his public
declaration, that if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery, he
should cast his Imperial mantle over the episcopal sinner. 2. The
domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a
restraint of the ecclesiastical order, whose civil causes were decently
withdrawn from the cognizance of a secular judge. Their venial offences
were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment; and the
gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its
parents or instructors, was inflicted by the temperate severity of the
bishops. But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be
sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honorable and
beneficial profession, the Roman magistrate drew the sword of justice,
without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities. 3. The arbitration of
the bishops was ratified by a positive law; and the judges were
instructed to execute, without appeal or delay, the episcopal decrees,
whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties. The
conversion of the magistrates themselves, and of the whole empire,
might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the Christians. But
they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops, whose abilities and
integrity they esteemed; and the venerable Austin enjoyed the
satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were
perpetually interrupted by the invidious labor of deciding the claim or
the possession of silver and gold, of lands and cattle. 4. The ancient
privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the Christian temples, and
extended, by the liberal piety of the younger Theodosius, to the
precincts of consecrated ground. 113 The fugitive, and even guilty
suppliants,were permitted to implore either the justice, or the mercy,
of the Deity and his ministers. The rash violence of despotism was
suspended by the mild interposition of the church; and the lives or
fortunes of the most eminent subjects might be protected by the
mediation of the bishop.

110 (return) [ From Eusebius (in Vit. Constant. l. iv. c. 27) and
Sozomen (l. i. c. 9) we are assured that the episcopal jurisdiction was
extended and confirmed by Constantine; but the forgery of a famous
edict, which was never fairly inserted in the Theodosian Code (see at
the end, tom. vi. p. 303,) is demonstrated by Godefroy in the most
satisfactory manner. It is strange that M. de Montesquieu, who was a
lawyer as well as a philosopher, should allege this edict of
Constantine (Esprit des Loix, l. xxix. c. 16) without intimating any
suspicion.]

by Giannone. Their moderation was the effect of situation as well as of
temper. Fleury was a French ecclesiastic, who respected the authority
of the parliaments; Giannone was an Italian lawyer, who dreaded the
power of the church. And here let me observe, that as the general
propositions which I advance are the result of _many_ particular and
imperfect facts, I must either refer the reader to those modern authors
who have expressly treated the subject, or swell these notes
disproportioned size.]

observes, that ancient Greece might perhaps contain fifteen or twenty
_azyla_ or sanctuaries; a number which at present may be found in Italy
within the walls of a single city.]

V. The bishop was the perpetual censor of the morals of his people The
discipline of penance was digested into a system of canonical
jurisprudence, 114 which accurately defined the duty of private or
public confession, the rules of evidence, the degrees of guilt, and the
measure of punishment. It was impossible to execute this spiritual
censure, if the Christian pontiff, who punished the obscure sins of the
multitude, respected the conspicuous vices and destructive crimes of
the magistrate: but it was impossible to arraign the conduct of the
magistrate, without, controlling the administration of civil
government. Some considerations of religion, or loyalty, or fear,
protected the sacred persons of the emperors from the zeal or
resentment of the bishops; but they boldly censured and excommunicated
the subordinate tyrants, who were not invested with the majesty of the
purple. St. Athanasius excommunicated one of the ministers of Egypt;
and the interdict which he pronounced, of fire and water, was solemnly
transmitted to the churches of Cappadocia. 115 Under the reign of the
younger Theodosius, the polite and eloquent Synesius, one of the
descendants of Hercules, 116 filled the episcopal seat of Ptolemais,
near the ruins of ancient Cyrene, 117 and the philosophic bishop
supported with dignity the character which he had assumed with
reluctance. 118 He vanquished the monster of Libya, the president
Andronicus, who abused the authority of a venal office, invented new
modes of rapine and torture, and aggravated the guilt of oppression by
that of sacrilege. 119 After a fruitless attempt to reclaim the haughty
magistrate by mild and religious admonition, Synesius proceeds to
inflict the last sentence of ecclesiastical justice, 120 which devotes
Andronicus, with his associates and their _families_, to the abhorrence
of earth and heaven. The impenitent sinners, more cruel than Phalaris
or Sennacherib, more destructive than war, pestilence, or a cloud of
locusts, are deprived of the name and privileges of Christians, of the
participation of the sacraments, and of the hope of Paradise. The
bishop exhorts the clergy, the magistrates, and the people, to renounce
all society with the enemies of Christ; to exclude them from their
houses and tables; and to refuse them the common offices of life, and
the decent rites of burial. The church of Ptolemais, obscure and
contemptible as she may appear, addresses this declaration to all her
sister churches of the world; and the profane who reject her decrees,
will be involved in the guilt and punishment of Andronicus and his
impious followers. These spiritual terrors were enforced by a dexterous
application to the Byzantine court; the trembling president implored
the mercy of the church; and the descendants of Hercules enjoyed the
satisfaction of raising a prostrate tyrant from the ground. 121 Such
principles and such examples insensibly prepared the triumph of the
Roman pontiffs, who have trampled on the necks of kings.

114 (return) [ The penitential jurisprudence was continually improved
by the canons of the councils. But as many cases were still left to the
discretion of the bishops, they occasionally published, after the
example of the Roman Prætor, the rules of discipline which they
proposed to observe. Among the canonical epistles of the fourth
century, those of Basil the Great were the most celebrated. They are
inserted in the Pandects of Beveridge, (tom. ii. p. 47-151,) and are
translated by Chardon, Hist. des Sacremens, tom. iv. p. 219-277.]

VI. Every popular government has experienced the effects of rude or
artificial eloquence. The coldest nature is animated, the firmest
reason is moved, by the rapid communication of the prevailing impulse;
and each hearer is affected by his own passions, and by those of the
surrounding multitude. The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the
demagogues of Athens, and the tribunes of Rome; the custom of preaching
which seems to constitute a considerable part of Christian devotion,
had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity; and the ears of
monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence,
till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators, who
possessed some advantages unknown to their profane predecessors. 122
The arguments and rhetoric of the tribune were instantly opposed with
equal arms, by skilful and resolute antagonists; and the cause of truth
and reason might derive an accidental support from the conflict of
hostile passions. The bishop, or some distinguished presbyter, to whom
he cautiously delegated the powers of preaching, harangued, without the
danger of interruption or reply, a submissive multitude, whose minds
had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion. Such
was the strict subordination of the Catholic church, that the same
concerted sounds might issue at once from a hundred pulpits of Italy or
Egypt, if they were _tuned_ 123 by the master hand of the Roman or
Alexandrian primate. The design of this institution was laudable, but
the fruits were not always salutary. The preachers recommended the
practice of the social duties; but they exalted the perfection of
monastic virtue, which is painful to the individual, and useless to
mankind. Their charitable exhortations betrayed a secret wish that the
clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful, for the
benefit of the poor. The most sublime representations of the attributes
and laws of the Deity were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical
subleties, puerile rites, and fictitious miracles: and they expatiated,
with the most fervent zeal, on the religious merit of hating the
adversaries, and obeying the ministers of the church. When the public
peace was distracted by heresy and schism, the sacred orators sounded
the trumpet of discord, and, perhaps, of sedition. The understandings
of their congregations were perplexed by mystery, their passions were
inflamed by invectives; and they rushed from the Christian temples of
Antioch or Alexandria, prepared either to suffer or to inflict
martyrdom. The corruption of taste and language is strongly marked in
the vehement declamations of the Latin bishops; but the compositions of
Gregory and Chrysostom have been compared with the most splendid models
of Attic, or at least of Asiatic, eloquence. 124

VII. The representatives of the Christian republic were regularly
assembled in the spring and autumn of each year; and these synods
diffused the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline and legislation
through the hundred and twenty provinces of the Roman world. 125 The
archbishop or metropolitan was empowered, by the laws, to summon the
suffragan bishops of his province; to revise their conduct, to
vindicate their rights, to declare their faith, and to examine the
merits of the candidates who were elected by the clergy and people to
supply the vacancies of the episcopal college. The primates of Rome,
Alexandria, Antioch, Carthage, and afterwards Constantinople, who
exercised a more ample jurisdiction, convened the numerous assembly of
their dependent bishops. But the convocation of great and extraordinary
synods was the prerogative of the emperor alone. Whenever the
emergencies of the church required this decisive measure, he despatched
a peremptory summons to the bishops, or the deputies of each province,
with an order for the use of post-horses, and a competent allowance for
the expenses of their journey. At an early period, when Constantine was
the protector, rather than the proselyte, of Christianity, he referred
the African controversy to the council of Arles; in which the bishops
of York of Trèves, of Milan, and of Carthage, met as friends and
brethren, to debate in their native tongue on the common interest of
the Latin or Western church. 126 Eleven years afterwards, a more
numerous and celebrated assembly was convened at Nice in Bithynia, to
extinguish, by their final sentence, the subtle disputes which had
arisen in Egypt on the subject of the Trinity. Three hundred and
eighteen bishops obeyed the summons of their indulgent master; the
ecclesiastics of every rank, and sect, and denomination, have been
computed at two thousand and forty-eight persons; 127 the Greeks
appeared in person; and the consent of the Latins was expressed by the
legates of the Roman pontiff. The session, which lasted about two
months, was frequently honored by the presence of the emperor. Leaving
his guards at the door, he seated himself (with the permission of the
council) on a low stool in the midst of the hall. Constantine listened
with patience, and spoke with modesty: and while he influenced the
debates, he humbly professed that he was the minister, not the judge,
of the successors of the apostles, who had been established as priests
and as gods upon earth. 128 Such profound reverence of an absolute
monarch towards a feeble and unarmed assembly of his own subjects, can
only be compared to the respect with which the senate had been treated
by the Roman princes who adopted the policy of Augustus. Within the
space of fifty years, a philosophic spectator of the vicissitudes of
human affairs might have contemplated Tacitus in the senate of Rome,
and Constantine in the council of Nice. The fathers of the Capitol and
those of the church had alike degenerated from the virtues of their
founders; but as the bishops were more deeply rooted in the public
opinion, they sustained their dignity with more decent pride, and
sometimes opposed with a manly spirit the wishes of their sovereign.
The progress of time and superstition erased the memory of the
weakness, the passion, the ignorance, which disgraced these
ecclesiastical synods; and the Catholic world has unanimously submitted
129 to the _infallible_ decrees of the general councils. 130

     Persecution Of Heresy.—The Schism Of The Donatists.—The Arian
     Controversy.—Athanasius.—Distracted State Of The Church And Empire
     Under Constantine And His Sons.— Toleration Of Paganism.

      The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of
      a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
      Constantine gave them security, wealth, honors, and revenge; and
      the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most
      sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate. The edict of
      Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each
      individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and
      professing his own religion. But this inestimable privilege was
      soon violated; with the knowledge of truth, the emperor imbibed
      the maxims of persecution; and the sects which dissented from the
      Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of
      Christianity. Constantine easily believed that the Heretics, who
      presumed to dispute _his_ opinions, or to oppose _his_ commands,
      were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy; and that a
      seasonable application of moderate severities might save those
      unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation. Not a
      moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the
      separated congregations from any share of the rewards and
      immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the
      orthodox clergy. But as the sectaries might still exist under the
      cloud of royal disgrace, the conquest of the East was immediately
      followed by an edict which announced their total destruction. 1
      After a preamble filled with passion and reproach, Constantine
      absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics, and
      confiscates their public property to the use either of the
      revenue or of the Catholic church. The sects against whom the
      Imperial severity was directed, appear to have been the adherents
      of Paul of Samosata; the Montanists of Phrygia, who maintained an
      enthusiastic succession of prophecy; the Novatians, who sternly
      rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and
      Valentinians, under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of
      Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied; and perhaps the
      Manichæans, who had recently imported from Persia a more artful
      composition of Oriental and Christian theology. 2 The design of
      extirpating the name, or at least of restraining the progress, of
      these odious Heretics, was prosecuted with vigor and effect. Some
      of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of
      Diocletian; and this method of conversion was applauded by the
      same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression, and pleaded for
      the rights of humanity. Two immaterial circumstances may serve,
      however, to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely
      corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry. Before he condemned
      the Manichæans and their kindred sects, he resolved to make an
      accurate inquiry into the nature of their religious principles.
      As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical
      counsellors, this delicate commission was intrusted to a civil
      magistrate, whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed, and
      of whose venal character he was probably ignorant. 3 The emperor
      was soon convinced, that he had too hastily proscribed the
      orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians, who had
      dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which
      were not perhaps essential to salvation. By a particular edict,
      he exempted them from the general penalties of the law; 4 allowed
      them to build a church at Constantinople, respected the miracles
      of their saints, invited their bishop Acesius to the council of
      Nice; and gently ridiculed the narrow tenets of his sect by a
      familiar jest; which, from the mouth of a sovereign, must have
      been received with applause and gratitude. 5

      is strange, that a philosophic and foreign heresy should have
      penetrated so rapidly into the African provinces; yet I cannot
      easily reject the edict of Diocletian against the Manichæans,
      which may be found in Baronius. (Annal Eccl. A. D. 287.)]

      yourself.” Most of the Christian sects have, by turns, borrowed
      the ladder of Acesius.]

      The complaints and mutual accusations which assailed the throne
      of Constantine, as soon as the death of Maxentius had submitted
      Africa to his victorious arms, were ill adapted to edify an
      imperfect proselyte. He learned, with surprise, that the
      provinces of that great country, from the confines of Cyrene to
      the columns of Hercules, were distracted with religious discord.
      6 The source of the division was derived from a double election
      in the church of Carthage; the second, in rank and opulence, of
      the ecclesiastical thrones of the West. Cæcilian and Majorinus
      were the two rival prelates of Africa; and the death of the
      latter soon made room for Donatus, who, by his superior abilities
      and apparent virtues, was the firmest support of his party. The
      advantage which Cæcilian might claim from the priority of his
      ordination, was destroyed by the illegal, or at least indecent,
      haste, with which it had been performed, without expecting the
      arrival of the bishops of Numidia. The authority of these
      bishops, who, to the number of seventy, condemned Cæcilian, and
      consecrated Majorinus, is again weakened by the infamy of some of
      their personal characters; and by the female intrigues,
      sacrilegious bargains, and tumultuous proceedings, which are
      imputed to this Numidian council. 7 The bishops of the contending
      factions maintained, with equal ardor and obstinacy, that their
      adversaries were degraded, or at least dishonored, by the odious
      crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the officers of
      Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, as well as from the
      story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferred, that
      the late persecution had imbittered the zeal, without reforming
      the manners, of the African Christians. That divided church was
      incapable of affording an impartial judicature; the controversy
      was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals, which were
      appointed by the emperor; and the whole proceeding, from the
      first appeal to the final sentence, lasted above three years. A
      severe inquisition, which was taken by the Prætorian vicar, and
      the proconsul of Africa, the report of two episcopal visitors who
      had been sent to Carthage, the decrees of the councils of Rome
      and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of Constantine himself in
      his sacred consistory, were all favorable to the cause of
      Cæcilian; and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and
      ecclesiastical powers, as the true and lawful primate of Africa.
      The honors and estates of the church were attributed to _his_
      suffragan bishops, and it was not without difficulty, that
      Constantine was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile
      on the principal leaders of the Donatist faction. As their cause
      was examined with attention, perhaps it was determined with
      justice. Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation, that
      the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious
      arts of his favorite Osius. The influence of falsehood and
      corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent, or
      aggravate the sentence of the guilty. Such an act, however, of
      injustice, if it concluded an importunate dispute, might be
      numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration,
      which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity.

      But this incident, so inconsiderable that it scarcely deserves a
      place in history, was productive of a memorable schism which
      afflicted the provinces of Africa above three hundred years, and
      was extinguished only with Christianity itself. The inflexible
      zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the Donatists to refuse
      obedience to the usurpers, whose election they disputed, and
      whose spiritual powers they denied. Excluded from the civil and
      religious communion of mankind, they boldly excommunicated the
      rest of mankind, who had embraced the impious party of Cæcilian,
      and of the Traditors, from which he derived his pretended
      ordination. They asserted with confidence, and almost with
      exultation, that the Apostolical succession was interrupted; that
      _all_ the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the
      contagion of guilt and schism; and that the prerogatives of the
      Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the
      African believers, who alone had preserved inviolate the
      integrity of their faith and discipline. This rigid theory was
      supported by the most uncharitable conduct. Whenever they
      acquired a proselyte, even from the distant provinces of the
      East, they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism 8 and
      ordination; as they rejected the validity of those which he had
      already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics.
      Bishops, virgins, and even spotless infants, were subjected to
      the disgrace of a public penance, before they could be admitted
      to the communion of the Donatists. If they obtained possession of
      a church which had been used by their Catholic adversaries, they
      purified the unhallowed building with the same zealous care which
      a temple of idols might have required. They washed the pavement,
      scraped the walls, burnt the altar, which was commonly of wood,
      melted the consecrated plate, and cast the Holy Eucharist to the
      dogs, with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and
      perpetuate the animosity of religious factions. 9 Notwithstanding
      this irreconcilable aversion, the two parties, who were mixed and
      separated in all the cities of Africa, had the same language and
      manners, the same zeal and learning, the same faith and worship.
      Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire,
      the Donatists still maintained in some provinces, particularly in
      Numidia, their superior numbers; and four hundred bishops
      acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate. But the
      invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals:
      and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine
      divisions. A fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the
      independent standard of the Maximianists. The narrow and solitary
      path which their first leaders had marked out, continued to
      deviate from the great society of mankind. Even the imperceptible
      sect of the Rogatians could affirm, without a blush, that when
      Christ should descend to judge the earth, he would find his true
      religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the
      Cæsarean Mauritania. 10

      church. Vincentius Lirinesis (p. 532, ap. Tillemont, Mém. Eccles.

      The schism of the Donatists was confined to Africa: the more
      diffusive mischief of the Trinitarian controversy successively
      penetrated into every part of the Christian world. The former was
      an accidental quarrel, occasioned by the abuse of freedom; the
      latter was a high and mysterious argument, derived from the abuse
      of philosophy. From the age of Constantine to that of Clovis and
      Theodoric, the temporal interests both of the Romans and
      Barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of
      Arianism. The historian may therefore be permitted respectfully
      to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary; and to deduce the progress
      of reason and faith, of error and passion from the school of
      Plato, to the decline and fall of the empire.

      The genius of Plato, informed by his own meditation, or by the
      traditional knowledge of the priests of Egypt, 11 had ventured to
      explore the mysterious nature of the Deity. When he had elevated
      his mind to the sublime contemplation of the first self-existent,
      necessary cause of the universe, the Athenian sage was incapable
      of conceiving _how_ the simple unity of his essence could admit
      the infinite variety of distinct and successive ideas which
      compose the model of the intellectual world; _how_ a Being purely
      incorporeal could execute that perfect model, and mould with a
      plastic hand the rude and independent chaos. The vain hope of
      extricating himself from these difficulties, which must ever
      oppress the feeble powers of the human mind, might induce Plato
      to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification—of
      the first cause, the reason, or _Logos_, and the soul or spirit
      of the universe. His poetical imagination sometimes fixed and
      animated these metaphysical abstractions; the three _archical_ on
      original principles were represented in the Platonic system as
      three Gods, united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable
      generation; and the Logos was particularly considered under the
      more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal Father, and
      the Creator and Governor of the world. Such appear to have been
      the secret doctrines which were cautiously whispered in the
      gardens of the academy; and which, according to the more recent
      disciples of Plato, 1111 could not be perfectly understood, till
      after an assiduous study of thirty years. 12

      unsocial manners of the Jewish people, whose scriptures were not
      accessible to Greek curiosity till more than one hundred years

      1111 (return) [ This exposition of the doctrine of Plato appears
      to me contrary to the true sense of that philosopher’s writings.
      The brilliant imagination which he carried into metaphysical
      inquiries, his style, full of allegories and figures, have misled
      those interpreters who did not seek, from the whole tenor of his
      works and beyond the images which the writer employs, the system
      of this philosopher. In my opinion, there is no Trinity in Plato;
      he has established no mysterious generation between the three
      pretended principles which he is made to distinguish. Finally, he
      conceives only as _attributes_ of the Deity, or of matter, those
      ideas, of which it is supposed that he made _substances_, real
      beings.
          According to Plato, God and matter existed from all eternity.
          Before the creation of the world, matter had in itself a
          principle of motion, but without end or laws: it is this
          principle which Plato calls the irrational soul of the world,
          because, according to his doctrine, every spontaneous and
          original principle of motion is called soul. God wished to
          impress _form_ upon matter, that is to say, 1. To mould
          matter, and make it into a body; 2. To regulate its motion,
          and subject it to some end and to certain laws. The Deity, in
          this operation, could not act but according to the ideas
          existing in his intelligence: their union filled this, and
          formed the ideal type of the world. It is this ideal world,
          this divine intelligence, existing with God from all
          eternity, and called by Plato which he is supposed to
          personify, to substantialize; while an attentive examination
          is sufficient to convince us that he has never assigned it an
          existence external to the Deity, (hors de la Divinité,) and
          that he considered the as the aggregate of the ideas of God,
          the divine understanding in its relation to the world. The
          contrary opinion is irreconcilable with all his philosophy:
          thus he says (Timæus, p. 348, edit. Bip.) that to the idea of
          the Deity is essentially united that of intelligence, of a
          _logos_. He would thus have admitted a double _logos;_ one
          inherent in the Deity as an attribute, the other
          independently existing as a substance. He affirms that the
          intelligence, the principle of order cannot exist but as an
          attribute of a soul, the principle of motion and of life, of
          which the nature is unknown to us. How, then, according to
          this, could he consider the _logos_ as a substance endowed
          with an independent existence? In other places, he explains
          it by these two words, knowledge, science, and intelligence
          which signify the attributes of the Deity. When Plato
          separates God, the ideal archetype of the world and matter,
          it is to explain how, according to his system, God has
          proceeded, at the creation, to unite the principle of order
          which he had within himself, his proper intelligence, the
          principle of motion, to the principle of motion, the
          irrational soul which was in matter. When he speaks of the
          place occupied by the ideal world, it is to designate the
          divine intelligence, which is its cause. Finally, in no part
          of his writings do we find a true personification of the
          pretended beings of which he is said to have formed a
          trinity: and if this personification existed, it would
          equally apply to many other notions, of which might be formed
          many different trinities.
          This error, into which many ancient as well as modern
          interpreters of Plato have fallen, was very natural. Besides
          the snares which were concealed in his figurative style;
          besides the necessity of comprehending as a whole the system
          of his ideas, and not to explain isolated passages, the
          nature of his doctrine itself would conduce to this error.
          When Plato appeared, the uncertainty of human knowledge, and
          the continual illusions of the senses, were acknowledged, and
          had given rise to a general scepticism. Socrates had aimed at
          raising morality above the influence of this scepticism:
          Plato endeavored to save metaphysics, by seeking in the human
          intellect a source of certainty which the senses could not
          furnish. He invented the system of innate ideas, of which the
          aggregate formed, according to him, the ideal world, and
          affirmed that these ideas were real attributes, not only
          attached to our conceptions of objects, but to the nature of
          the objects themselves; a nature of which from them we might
          obtain a knowledge. He gave, then, to these ideas a positive
          existence as attributes; his commentators could easily give
          them a real existence as substances; especially as the terms
          which he used to designate them, essential beauty, essential
          goodness, lent themselves to this substantialization,
          (hypostasis.)—G.
          We have retained this view of the original philosophy of
          Plato, in which there is probably much truth. The genius of
          Plato was rather metaphysical than impersonative: his poetry
          was in his language, rather than, like that of the Orientals,
          in his conceptions.—M.]

      their disputes, and certainty from their agreement.]

      The arms of the Macedonians diffused over Asia and Egypt the
      language and learning of Greece; and the theological system of
      Plato was taught, with less reserve, and perhaps with some
      improvements, in the celebrated school of Alexandria. 13 A
      numerous colony of Jews had been invited, by the favor of the
      Ptolemies, to settle in their new capital. 14 While the bulk of
      the nation practised the legal ceremonies, and pursued the
      lucrative occupations of commerce, a few Hebrews, of a more
      liberal spirit, devoted their lives to religious and
      philosophical contemplation. 15 They cultivated with diligence,
      and embraced with ardor, the theological system of the Athenian
      sage. But their national pride would have been mortified by a
      fair confession of their former poverty: and they boldly marked,
      as the sacred inheritance of their ancestors, the gold and jewels
      which they had so lately stolen from their Egyptian masters. One
      hundred years before the birth of Christ, a philosophical
      treatise, which manifestly betrays the style and sentiments of
      the school of Plato, was produced by the Alexandrian Jews, and
      unanimously received as a genuine and valuable relic of the
      inspired Wisdom of Solomon. 16 A similar union of the Mosaic
      faith and the Grecian philosophy, distinguishes the works of
      Philo, which were composed, for the most part, under the reign of
      Augustus. 17 The material soul of the universe 18 might offend
      the piety of the Hebrews: but they applied the character of the
      Logos to the Jehovah of Moses and the patriarchs; and the Son of
      God was introduced upon earth under a visible, and even human
      appearance, to perform those familiar offices which seem
      incompatible with the nature and attributes of the Universal
      Cause. 19

      13 (return) [ Brucker, Hist. Philosoph. tom. i. p. 1349-1357. The
      Alexandrian school is celebrated by Strabo (l. xvii.) and
      Ammianus, (xxii. 6.) Note: The philosophy of Plato was not the
      only source of that professed in the school of Alexandria. That
      city, in which Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian men of letters were
      assembled, was the scene of a strange fusion of the system of
      these three people. The Greeks brought a Platonism, already much
      changed; the Jews, who had acquired at Babylon a great number of
      Oriental notions, and whose theological opinions had undergone
      great changes by this intercourse, endeavored to reconcile
      Platonism with their new doctrine, and disfigured it entirely:
      lastly, the Egyptians, who were not willing to abandon notions
      for which the Greeks themselves entertained respect, endeavored
      on their side to reconcile their own with those of their
      neighbors. It is in Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon that
      we trace the influence of Oriental philosophy rather than that of
      Platonism. We find in these books, and in those of the later
      prophets, as in Ezekiel, notions unknown to the Jews before the
      Babylonian captivity, of which we do not discover the germ in
      Plato, but which are manifestly derived from the Orientals. Thus
      God represented under the image of light, and the principle of
      evil under that of darkness; the history of the good and bad
      angels; paradise and hell, &c., are doctrines of which the
      origin, or at least the positive determination, can only be
      referred to the Oriental philosophy. Plato supposed matter
      eternal; the Orientals and the Jews considered it as a creation
      of God, who alone was eternal. It is impossible to explain the
      philosophy of the Alexandrian school solely by the blending of
      the Jewish theology with the Greek philosophy. The Oriental
      philosophy, however little it may be known, is recognized at
      every instant. Thus, according to the Zend Avesta, it is by the
      Word (honover) more ancient than the world, that Ormuzd created
      the universe. This word is the logos of Philo, consequently very
      different from that of Plato. I have shown that Plato never
      personified the logos as the ideal archetype of the world: Philo
      ventured this personification. The Deity, according to him, has a
      double logos; the first is the ideal archetype of the world, the
      ideal world, the _first-born_ of the Deity; the second is the
      word itself of God, personified under the image of a being acting
      to create the sensible world, and to make it like to the ideal
      world: it is the second-born of God. Following out his
      imaginations, Philo went so far as to personify anew the ideal
      world, under the image of a celestial man, the primitive type of
      man, and the sensible world under the image of another man less
      perfect than the celestial man. Certain notions of the Oriental
      philosophy may have given rise to this strange abuse of allegory,
      which it is sufficient to relate, to show what alterations
      Platonism had already undergone, and what was their source.
      Philo, moreover, of all the Jews of Alexandria, is the one whose
      Platonism is the most pure. It is from this mixture of
      Orientalism, Platonism, and Judaism, that Gnosticism arose, which
      had produced so many theological and philosophical
      extravagancies, and in which Oriental notions evidently
      predominate.—G.]

      were insufficient to establish the truth of a mysterious
      doctrine, which might please, but could not satisfy, a rational

      theology of Plato might have been forever confounded with the
      philosophical visions of the Academy, the Porch, and the Lycæum,
      if the name and divine attributes of the _Logos_ had not been
      confirmed by the celestial pen of the last and most sublime of
      the Evangelists. 20 The Christian Revelation, which was
      consummated under the reign of Nerva, disclosed to the world the
      amazing secret, that the Logos, who was with God from the
      beginning, and was God, who had made all things, and for whom all
      things had been made, was incarnate in the person of Jesus of
      Nazareth; who had been born of a virgin, and suffered death on
      the cross. Besides the general design of fixing on a perpetual
      basis the divine honors of Christ, the most ancient and
      respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have ascribed to the
      evangelic theologian a particular intention to confute two
      opposite heresies, which disturbed the peace of the primitive
      church. 21 I. The faith of the Ebionites, 22 perhaps of the
      Nazarenes, 23 was gross and imperfect. They revered Jesus as the
      greatest of the prophets, endowed with supernatural virtue and
      power. They ascribed to his person and to his future reign all
      the predictions of the Hebrew oracles which relate to the
      spiritual and everlasting kingdom of the promised Messiah. 24
      Some of them might confess that he was born of a virgin; but they
      obstinately rejected the preceding existence and divine
      perfections of the _Logos_, or Son of God, which are so clearly
      defined in the Gospel of St. John. About fifty years afterwards,
      the Ebionites, whose errors are mentioned by Justin Martyr with
      less severity than they seem to deserve, 25 formed a very
      inconsiderable portion of the Christian name. II. The Gnostics,
      who were distinguished by the epithet of _Docetes_, deviated into
      the contrary extreme; and betrayed the human, while they asserted
      the divine, nature of Christ. Educated in the school of Plato,
      accustomed to the sublime idea of the Logos, they readily
      conceived that the brightest _Æon_, or _Emanation_ of the Deity,
      might assume the outward shape and visible appearances of a
      mortal; 26 but they vainly pretended, that the imperfections of
      matter are incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance.

      While the blood of Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary, the
      Docetes invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis, that,
      instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin, 27 he had
      descended on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect
      manhood; that he had imposed on the senses of his enemies, and of
      his disciples; and that the ministers of Pilate had wasted their
      impotent rage on an ury phantom, who _seemed_ to expire on the
      cross, and, after three days, to rise from the dead. 28

      20 (return) [ The Platonists admired the beginning of the Gospel
      of St. John as containing an exact transcript of their own
      principles. Augustin de Civitat. Dei, x. 29. Amelius apud Cyril.
      advers. Julian. l. viii. p. 283. But in the third and fourth
      centuries, the Platonists of Alexandria might improve their
      Trinity by the secret study of the Christian theology. Note: A
      short discussion on the sense in which St. John has used the word
      Logos, will prove that he has not borrowed it from the philosophy
      of Plato. The evangelist adopts this word without previous
      explanation, as a term with which his contemporaries were already
      familiar, and which they could at once comprehend. To know the
      sense which he gave to it, we must inquire that which it
      generally bore in his time. We find two: the one attached to the
      word _logos_ by the Jews of Palestine, the other by the school of
      Alexandria, particularly by Philo. The Jews had feared at all
      times to pronounce the name of Jehovah; they had formed a habit
      of designating God by one of his attributes; they called him
      sometimes Wisdom, sometimes the Word. _By the word of the Lord
      were the heavens made_. (Psalm xxxiii. 6.) Accustomed to
      allegories, they often addressed themselves to this attribute of
      the Deity as a real being. Solomon makes Wisdom say “The Lord
      possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of
      old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever
      the earth was.” (Prov. viii. 22, 23.) Their residence in Persia
      only increased this inclination to sustained allegories. In the
      Ecclesiasticus of the son of Sirach, and the Book of Wisdom, we
      find allegorical descriptions of Wisdom like the following: “I
      came out of the mouth of the Most High; I covered the earth as a
      cloud;... I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in
      the bottom of the deep... The Creator created me from the
      beginning, before the world, and I shall never fail.” (Eccles.
      xxiv. 35- 39.) See also the Wisdom of Solomon, c. vii. v. 9. [The
      latter book is clearly Alexandrian.—M.] We see from this that the
      Jews understood from the Hebrew and Chaldaic words which signify
      Wisdom, the Word, and which were translated into Greek, a simple
      attribute of the Deity, allegorically personified, but of which
      they did not make a real particular being separate from the
      Deity.
          The school of Alexandria, on the contrary, and Philo among
          the rest, mingling Greek with Jewish and Oriental notions,
          and abandoning himself to his inclination to mysticism,
          personified the logos, and represented it a distinct being,
          created by God, and intermediate between God and man. This is
          the second _logos_ of Philo, that which acts from the
          beginning of the world, alone in its kind, creator of the
          sensible world, formed by God according to the ideal world
          which he had in himself, and which was the first logos, the
          first- born of the Deity. The logos taken in this sense,
          then, was a created being, but, anterior to the creation of
          the world, near to God, and charged with his revelations to
          mankind.
          Which of these two senses is that which St. John intended to
          assign to the word logos in the first chapter of his Gospel,
          and in all his writings? St. John was a Jew, born and
          educated in Palestine; he had no knowledge, at least very
          little, of the philosophy of the Greeks, and that of the
          Grecizing Jews: he would naturally, then, attach to the word
          _logos_ the sense attached to it by the Jews of Palestine.
          If, in fact, we compare the attributes which he assigns to
          the _logos_ with those which are assigned to it in Proverbs,
          in the Wisdom of Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus, we shall see
          that they are the same. The Word was in the world, and the
          world was made by him; in him was life, and the life was the
          light of men, (c. i. v. 10-14.) It is impossible not to trace
          in this chapter the ideas which the Jews had formed of the
          allegorized logos. The evangelist afterwards really
          personifies that which his predecessors have personified only
          poetically; for he affirms “_that the Word became flesh_,”
          (v. 14.) It was to prove this that he wrote. Closely
          examined, the ideas which he gives of the logos cannot agree
          with those of Philo and the school of Alexandria; they
          correspond, on the contrary, with those of the Jews of
          Palestine. Perhaps St. John, employing a well-known term to
          explain a doctrine which was yet unknown, has slightly
          altered the sense; it is this alteration which we appear to
          discover on comparing different passages of his writings.
          It is worthy of remark, that the Jews of Palestine, who did
          not perceive this alteration, could find nothing
          extraordinary in what St. John said of the Logos; at least
          they comprehended it without difficulty, while the Greeks and
          Grecizing Jews, on their part, brought to it prejudices and
          preconceptions easily reconciled with those of the
          evangelist, who did not expressly contradict them. This
          circumstance must have much favored the progress of
          Christianity. Thus the fathers of the church in the two first
          centuries and later, formed almost all in the school of
          Alexandria, gave to the Logos of St. John a sense nearly
          similar to that which it received from Philo. Their doctrine
          approached very near to that which in the fourth century the
          council of Nice condemned in the person of Arius.—G.
          M. Guizot has forgotten the long residence of St. John at
          Ephesus, the centre of the mingling opinions of the East and
          West, which were gradually growing up into Gnosticism. (See
          Matter. Hist. du Gnosticisme, vol. i. p. 154.) St. John’s
          sense of the Logos seems as far removed from the simple
          allegory ascribed to the Palestinian Jews as from the
          Oriental impersonation of the Alexandrian. The simple truth
          may be that St. John took the familiar term, and, as it were
          infused into it the peculiar and Christian sense in which it
          is used in his writings.—M.]

      himself. See Beausobre, tom. ii. p. 523, * Note: The greater part
      of the Docetæ rejected the true divinity of Jesus Christ, as well
      as his human nature. They belonged to the Gnostics, whom some
      philosophers, in whose party Gibbon has enlisted, make to derive
      their opinions from those of Plato. These philosophers did not
      consider that Platonism had undergone continual alterations, and
      that those who gave it some analogy with the notions of the
      Gnostics were later in their origin than most of the sects
      comprehended under this name Mosheim has proved (in his Instit.
      Histor. Eccles. Major. s. i. p. 136, sqq and p. 339, sqq.) that
      the Oriental philosophy, combined with the cabalistical

      relations which exist between this doctrine and the records which
      remain to us of that of the Orientals, the Chaldean and Persian,
      have been the source of the errors of the Gnostic Christians, who
      wished to reconcile their ancient notions with their new belief.
      It is on this account that, denying the human nature of Christ,
      they also denied his intimate union with God, and took him for
      one of the substances (æons) created by God. As they believed in
      the eternity of matter, and considered it to be the principle of
      evil, in opposition to the Deity, the first cause and principle
      of good, they were unwilling to admit that one of the pure
      substances, one of the æons which came forth from God, had, by
      partaking in the material nature, allied himself to the principle
      of evil; and this was their motive for rejecting the real
      humanity of Jesus Christ. See Ch. G. F. Walch, Hist. of Heresies

      shines at noonday. These _Docetes_, who formed the most
      considerable party among the Gnostics, were so called, because
      they granted only a _seeming_ body to Christ. * Note: The name of
      Docetæ was given to these sectaries only in the course of the
      second century: this name did not designate a sect, properly so

      c. 13, p. 552) makes express mention of a sect of Docetæ, and
      even names as one of its heads a certain Cassianus; but every

      The divine sanction, which the Apostle had bestowed on the
      fundamental principle of the theology of Plato, encouraged the
      learned proselytes of the second and third centuries to admire
      and study the writings of the Athenian sage, who had thus
      marvellously anticipated one of the most surprising discoveries
      of the Christian revelation. The respectable name of Plato was
      used by the orthodox, 29 and abused by the heretics, 30 as the
      common support of truth and error: the authority of his skilful
      commentators, and the science of dialectics, were employed to
      justify the remote consequences of his opinions and to supply the
      discreet silence of the inspired writers. The same subtle and
      profound questions concerning the nature, the generation, the
      distinction, and the equality of the three divine persons of the
      mysterious _Triad_, or _Trinity_, 31 were agitated in the
      philosophical and in the Christian schools of Alexandria. An
      eager spirit of curiosity urged them to explore the secrets of
      the abyss; and the pride of the professors, and of their
      disciples, was satisfied with the sciences of words. But the most
      sagacious of the Christian theologians, the great Athanasius
      himself, has candidly confessed, 32 that whenever he forced his
      understanding to meditate on the divinity of the _Logos_, his
      toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves; that the
      more he thought, the less he comprehended; and the more he wrote,
      the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts. In every step
      of the inquiry, we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the
      immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the
      capacity of the human mind. We may strive to abstract the notions
      of time, of space, and of matter, which so closely adhere to all
      the perceptions of our experimental knowledge. But as soon as we
      presume to reason of infinite substance, of spiritual generation;
      as often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative
      idea, we are involved in darkness, perplexity, and inevitable
      contradiction. As these difficulties arise from the nature of the
      subject, they oppress, with the same insuperable weight, the
      philosophic and the theological disputant; but we may observe two
      essential and peculiar circumstances, which discriminated the
      doctrines of the Catholic church from the opinions of the
      Platonic school.

      I. A chosen society of philosophers, men of a liberal education
      and curious disposition, might silently meditate, and temperately
      discuss in the gardens of Athens or the library of Alexandria,
      the abstruse questions of metaphysical science. The lofty
      speculations, which neither convinced the understanding, nor
      agitated the passions, of the Platonists themselves, were
      carelessly overlooked by the idle, the busy, and even the
      studious part of mankind. 33 But after the _Logos_ had been
      revealed as the sacred object of the faith, the hope, and the
      religious worship of the Christians, the mysterious system was
      embraced by a numerous and increasing multitude in every province
      of the Roman world. Those persons who, from their age, or sex, or
      occupations, were the least qualified to judge, who were the
      least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning, aspired to
      contemplate the economy of the Divine Nature: and it is the boast
      of Tertullian, 34 that a Christian mechanic could readily answer
      such questions as had perplexed the wisest of the Grecian sages.
      Where the subject lies so far beyond our reach, the difference
      between the highest and the lowest of human understandings may
      indeed be calculated as infinitely small; yet the degree of
      weakness may perhaps be measured by the degree of obstinacy and
      dogmatic confidence. These speculations, instead of being treated
      as the amusement of a vacant hour, became the most serious
      business of the present, and the most useful preparation for a
      future, life. A theology, which it was incumbent to believe,
      which it was impious to doubt, and which it might be dangerous,
      and even fatal, to mistake, became the familiar topic of private
      meditation and popular discourse. The cold indifference of
      philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion; and
      even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious
      prejudices of sense and experience. The Christians, who abhorred
      the gross and impure generation of the Greek mythology, 35 were
      tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and
      paternal relations. The character of _Son_ seemed to imply a
      perpetual subordination to the voluntary author of his existence;
      36 but as the act of generation, in the most spiritual and
      abstracted sense, must be supposed to transmit the properties of
      a common nature, 37 they durst not presume to circumscribe the
      powers or the duration of the Son of an eternal and omnipotent
      Father. Fourscore years after the death of Christ, the Christians
      of Bithynia, declared before the tribunal of Pliny, that they
      invoked him as a god: and his divine honors have been perpetuated
      in every age and country, by the various sects who assume the
      name of his disciples. 38 Their tender reverence for the memory
      of Christ, and their horror for the profane worship of any
      created being, would have engaged them to assert the equal and
      absolute divinity of the _Logos_, if their rapid ascent towards
      the throne of heaven had not been imperceptibly checked by the
      apprehension of violating the unity and sole supremacy of the
      great Father of Christ and of the Universe. The suspense and
      fluctuation produced in the minds of the Christians by these
      opposite tendencies, may be observed in the writings of the
      theologians who flourished after the end of the apostolic age,
      and before the origin of the Arian controversy. Their suffrage is
      claimed, with equal confidence, by the orthodox and by the
      heretical parties; and the most inquisitive critics have fairly
      allowed, that if they had the good fortune of possessing the
      Catholic verity, they have delivered their conceptions in loose,
      inaccurate, and sometimes contradictory language. 39

      Chapter XXI: Persecution Of Heresy, State Of The Church.—Part
      III.


      II. The devotion of individuals was the first circumstance which
      distinguished the Christians from the Platonists: the second was
      the authority of the church. The disciples of philosophy asserted
      the rights of intellectual freedom, and their respect for the
      sentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute,
      which they offered to superior reason. But the Christians formed
      a numerous and disciplined society; and the jurisdiction of their
      laws and magistrates was strictly exercised over the minds of the
      faithful. The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually
      confined by creeds and confessions; 40 the freedom of private
      judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods; the authority
      of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank; and
      the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures
      of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief. But
      in an age of religious controversy, every act of oppression adds
      new force to the elastic vigor of the mind; and the zeal or
      obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret
      motives of ambition or avarice. A metaphysical argument became
      the cause or pretence of political contests; the subtleties of
      the Platonic school were used as the badges of popular factions,
      and the distance which separated their respective tenets were
      enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute. As long as the
      dark heresies of Praxeas and Sabellius labored to confound the
      _Father_ with the _Son_, 41 the orthodox party might be excused
      if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the
      _distinction_, than to the _equality_, of the divine persons. But
      as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided, and the progress
      of the Sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the
      churches of Rome, of Africa, or of Egypt, the tide of theological
      opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion towards the
      contrary extreme; and the most orthodox doctors allowed
      themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been
      censured in the mouth of the sectaries. 42 After the edict of
      toleration had restored peace and leisure to the Christians, the
      Trinitarian controversy was revived in the ancient seat of
      Platonism, the learned, the opulent, the tumultuous city of
      Alexandria; and the flame of religious discord was rapidly
      communicated from the schools to the clergy, the people, the
      province, and the East. The abstruse question of the eternity of
      the _Logos_ was agitated in ecclesiastic conferences and popular
      sermons; and the heterodox opinions of Arius 43 were soon made
      public by his own zeal, and by that of his adversaries. His most
      implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and
      blameless life of that eminent presbyter, who, in a former
      election, had declared, and perhaps generously declined, his
      pretensions to the episcopal throne. 44 His competitor Alexander
      assumed the office of his judge. The important cause was argued
      before him; and if at first he seemed to hesitate, he at length
      pronounced his final sentence, as an absolute rule of faith. 45
      The undaunted presbyter, who presumed to resist the authority of
      his angry bishop, was separated from the community of the church.
      But the pride of Arius was supported by the applause of a
      numerous party. He reckoned among his immediate followers two
      bishops of Egypt, seven presbyters, twelve deacons, and (what may
      appear almost incredible) seven hundred virgins. A large majority
      of the bishops of Asia appeared to support or favor his cause;
      and their measures were conducted by Eusebius of Cæsarea, the
      most learned of the Christian prelates; and by Eusebius of
      Nicomedia, who had acquired the reputation of a statesman without
      forfeiting that of a saint. Synods in Palestine and Bithynia were
      opposed to the synods of Egypt. The attention of the prince and
      people was attracted by this theological dispute; and the
      decision, at the end of six years, 46 was referred to the supreme
      authority of the general council of Nice.

      When the mysteries of the Christian faith were dangerously
      exposed to public debate, it might be observed, that the human
      understanding was capable of forming three district, though
      imperfect systems, concerning the nature of the Divine Trinity;
      and it was pronounced, that none of these systems, in a pure and
      absolute sense, were exempt from heresy and error. 47 I.
      According to the first hypothesis, which was maintained by Arius
      and his disciples, the _Logos_ was a dependent and spontaneous
      production, created from nothing by the will of the father. The
      Son, by whom all things were made, 48 had been begotten before
      all worlds, and the longest of the astronomical periods could be
      compared only as a fleeting moment to the extent of his duration;
      yet this duration was not infinite, 49 and there _had_ been a
      time which preceded the ineffable generation of the _Logos_. On
      this only-begotten Son, the Almighty Father had transfused his
      ample spirit, and impressed the effulgence of his glory. Visible
      image of invisible perfection, he saw, at an immeasurable
      distance beneath his feet, the thrones of the brightest
      archangels; yet he shone only with a reflected light, and, like
      the sons of the Romans emperors, who were invested with the
      titles of Cæsar or Augustus, 50 he governed the universe in
      obedience to the will of his Father and Monarch. II. In the
      second hypothesis, the _Logos_ possessed all the inherent,
      incommunicable perfections, which religion and philosophy
      appropriate to the Supreme God. Three distinct and infinite minds
      or substances, three coëqual and coëternal beings, composed the
      Divine Essence; 51 and it would have implied contradiction, that
      any of them should not have existed, or that they should ever
      cease to exist. 52 The advocates of a system which seemed to
      establish three independent Deities, attempted to preserve the
      unity of the First Cause, so conspicuous in the design and order
      of the world, by the perpetual concord of their administration,
      and the essential agreement of their will. A faint resemblance of
      this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men,
      and even of animals. The causes which disturb their harmony,
      proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their
      faculties; but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom
      and goodness, cannot fail of choosing the same means for the
      accomplishment of the same ends. III. Three beings, who, by the
      self-derived necessity of their existence, possess all the divine
      attributes in the most perfect degree; who are eternal in
      duration, infinite in space, and intimately present to each
      other, and to the whole universe; irresistibly force themselves
      on the astonished mind, as one and the same being, 53 who, in the
      economy of grace, as well as in that of nature, may manifest
      himself under different forms, and be considered under different
      aspects. By this hypothesis, a real substantial trinity is
      refined into a trinity of names, and abstract modifications, that
      subsist only in the mind which conceives them. The _Logos_ is no
      longer a person, but an attribute; and it is only in a figurative
      sense that the epithet of Son can be applied to the eternal
      reason, which was with God from the beginning, and by _which_,
      not by _whom_, all things were made. The incarnation of the
      _Logos_ is reduced to a mere inspiration of the Divine Wisdom,
      which filled the soul, and directed all the actions, of the man
      Jesus. Thus, after revolving around the theological circle, we
      are surprised to find that the Sabellian ends where the Ebionite
      had begun; and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites
      our adoration, eludes our inquiry. 54

      were branded by their adversaries. See the invectives of

      If the bishops of the council of Nice 55 had been permitted to
      follow the unbiased dictates of their conscience, Arius and his
      associates could scarcely have flattered themselves with the
      hopes of obtaining a majority of votes, in favor of an hypothesis
      so directly averse to the two most popular opinions of the
      Catholic world. The Arians soon perceived the danger of their
      situation, and prudently assumed those modest virtues, which, in
      the fury of civil and religious dissensions, are seldom
      practised, or even praised, except by the weaker party. They
      recommended the exercise of Christian charity and moderation;
      urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy, disclaimed
      the use of any terms or definitions which could not be found in
      the Scriptures; and offered, by very liberal concessions, to
      satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of
      their own principles. The victorious faction received all their
      proposals with haughty suspicion; and anxiously sought for some
      irreconcilable mark of distinction, the rejection of which might
      involve the Arians in the guilt and consequences of heresy. A
      letter was publicly read, and ignominiously torn, in which their
      patron, Eusebius of Nicomedia, ingenuously confessed, that the
      admission of the Homoousion, or Consubstantial, a word already
      familiar to the Platonists, was incompatible with the principles
      of their theological system. The fortunate opportunity was
      eagerly embraced by the bishops, who governed the resolutions of
      the synod; and, according to the lively expression of Ambrose, 56
      they used the sword, which heresy itself had drawn from the
      scabbard, to cut off the head of the hated monster. The
      consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was established by
      the council of Nice, and has been unanimously received as a
      fundamental article of the Christian faith, by the consent of the
      Greek, the Latin, the Oriental, and the Protestant churches. But
      if the same word had not served to stigmatize the heretics, and
      to unite the Catholics, it would have been inadequate to the
      purpose of the majority, by whom it was introduced into the
      orthodox creed. This majority was divided into two parties,
      distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the
      Tritheists and of the Sabellians. But as those opposite extremes
      seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed
      religion, they mutually agreed to qualify the rigor of their
      principles; and to disavow the just, but invidious, consequences,
      which might be urged by their antagonists. The interest of the
      common cause inclined them to join their numbers, and to conceal
      their differences; their animosity was softened by the healing
      counsels of toleration, and their disputes were suspended by the
      use of the mysterious _Homoousion_, which either party was free
      to interpret according to their peculiar tenets. The Sabellian
      sense, which, about fifty years before, had obliged the council
      of Antioch 57 to prohibit this celebrated term, had endeared it
      to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial
      affection for a nominal Trinity. But the more fashionable saints
      of the Arian times, the intrepid Athanasius, the learned Gregory
      Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the church, who supported
      with ability and success the Nicene doctrine, appeared to
      consider the expression of _substance_ as if it had been
      synonymous with that of _nature;_ and they ventured to illustrate
      their meaning, by affirming that three men, as they belong to the
      same common species, are consubstantial, or homoousian to each
      other. 58 This pure and distinct equality was tempered, on the
      one hand, by the internal connection, and spiritual penetration
      which indissolubly unites the divine persons; 59 and, on the
      other, by the preëminence of the Father, which was acknowledged
      as far as it is compatible with the independence of the Son. 60
      Within these limits, the almost invisible and tremulous ball of
      orthodoxy was allowed securely to vibrate. On either side, beyond
      this consecrated ground, the heretics and the dæmons lurked in
      ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer. But as the
      degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war,
      rather than on the importance of the controversy, the heretics
      who degraded, were treated with more severity than those who
      annihilated, the person of the Son. The life of Athanasius was
      consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious _madness_ of
      the Arians; 61 but he defended above twenty years the
      Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra; and when at last he was
      compelled to withdraw himself from his communion, he continued to
      mention, with an ambiguous smile, the venial errors of his
      respectable friend. 62

      obscure disputes, some nocturnal combats, to maintain and
      perpetuate the uniformity of faith, or at least of language. The
      consubstantialists, who by their success have deserved and
      obtained the title of Catholics, gloried in the simplicity and
      steadiness of their own creed, and insulted the repeated
      variations of their adversaries, who were destitute of any
      certain rule of faith. The sincerity or the cunning of the Arian

      for Christ, their hatred of Athanasius, all the causes, human and
      divine, that influence and disturb the counsels of a theological

      inconstancy, which, in the course of a few years, erected
      eighteen different models of religion, 63 and avenged the
      violated dignity of the church. The zealous Hilary, 64 who, from

      which I shall transcribe a few lines, the bishop of Poitiers
      unwarily deviates into the style of a Christian philosopher. “It
      is a thing,” says Hilary, “equally deplorable and dangerous, that
      there are as many creeds as opinions among men, as many doctrines
      as inclinations, and as many sources of blasphemy as there are
      faults among us; because we make creeds arbitrarily, and explain
      them as arbitrarily. The Homoousion is rejected, and received,
      and explained away by successive synods. The partial or total
      resemblance of the Father and of the Son is a subject of dispute
      for these unhappy times. Every year, nay, every moon, we make new
      creeds to describe invisible mysteries. We repent of what we have
      done, we defend those who repent, we anathematize those whom we
      defended. We condemn either the doctrine of others in ourselves,
      or our own in that of others; and reciprocally tearing one
      another to pieces, we have been the cause of each other’s ruin.”

      It will not be expected, it would not perhaps be endured, that I
      should swell this theological digression, by a minute examination
      of the eighteen creeds, the authors of which, for the most part,
      disclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius. It is amusing
      enough to delineate the form, and to trace the vegetation, of a
      singular plant; but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers,
      and of branches without fruit, would soon exhaust the patience,
      and disappoint the curiosity, of the laborious student. One
      question, which gradually arose from the Arian controversy, may,
      however, be noticed, as it served to produce and discriminate the
      three sects, who were united only by their common aversion to the
      Homoousion of the Nicene synod. 1. If they were asked whether the
      Son was _like_ unto the Father, the question was resolutely
      answered in the negative, by the heretics who adhered to the
      principles of Arius, or indeed to those of philosophy; which seem
      to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the
      most excellent of his creatures. This obvious consequence was
      maintained by Ætius, 67 on whom the zeal of his adversaries
      bestowed the surname of the Atheist. His restless and aspiring
      spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life. He
      was successively a slave, or at least a husbandman, a travelling
      tinker, a goldsmith, a physician, a schoolmaster, a theologian,
      and at last the apostle of a new church, which was propagated by
      the abilities of his disciple Eunomius. 68 Armed with texts of
      Scripture, and with captious syllogisms from the logic of
      Aristotle, the subtle Ætius had acquired the fame of an
      invincible disputant, whom it was impossible either to silence or
      to convince. Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian
      bishops, till they were forced to renounce, and even to
      persecute, a dangerous ally, who, by the accuracy of his
      reasoning, had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion, and
      offended the piety of their most devoted followers. 2. The
      omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful
      solution of the _likeness_ of the Father and the Son; and faith
      might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny, that
      the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections, and
      create a being similar only to himself. 69 These Arians were
      powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their
      leaders, who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian
      interest, and who occupied the principal thrones of the East.
      They detested, perhaps with some affectation, the impiety of
      Ætius; they professed to believe, either without reserve, or
      according to the Scriptures, that the Son was different from all
      _other_ creatures, and similar only to the Father. But they
      denied, the he was either of the same, or of a similar substance;
      sometimes boldly justifying their dissent, and sometimes
      objecting to the use of the word substance, which seems to imply
      an adequate, or at least, a distinct, notion of the nature of the
      Deity. 3. The sect which deserted the doctrine of a similar
      substance, was the most numerous, at least in the provinces of
      Asia; and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the
      council of Seleucia, 70 _their_ opinion would have prevailed by a
      majority of one hundred and five to forty-three bishops. The
      Greek word, which was chosen to express this mysterious
      resemblance, bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol,
      that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests
      which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the
      Homoousians and the Homoiousians. As it frequently happens, that
      the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each
      other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas, the
      observation would be itself ridiculous, if it were possible to
      mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of
      the Semi-Arians, as they were improperly styled, and that of the
      Catholics themselves. The bishop of Poitiers, who in his Phrygian
      exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties, endeavors to
      prove that by a pious and faithful interpretation, 71 the
      _Homoiousion_ may be reduced to a consubstantial sense. Yet he
      confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect; and, as
      if darkness were congenial to theological disputes, the
      Semi-Arians, who advanced to the doors of the church, assailed
      them with the most unrelenting fury.

      The provinces of Egypt and Asia, which cultivated the language
      and manners of the Greeks, had deeply imbibed the venom of the
      Arian controversy. The familiar study of the Platonic system, a
      vain and argumentative disposition, a copious and flexible idiom,
      supplied the clergy and people of the East with an inexhaustible
      flow of words and distinctions; and, in the midst of their fierce
      contentions, they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by
      philosophy, and the submission which is enjoined by religion. The
      inhabitants of the West were of a less inquisitive spirit; their
      passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects, their
      minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute;
      and such was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church, that
      Hilary himself, above thirty years after the first general
      council, was still a stranger to the Nicene creed. 72 The Latins
      had received the rays of divine knowledge through the dark and
      doubtful medium of a translation. The poverty and stubbornness of
      their native tongue was not always capable of affording just
      equivalents for the Greek terms, for the technical words of the
      Platonic philosophy, 73 which had been consecrated, by the gospel
      or by the church, to express the mysteries of the Christian
      faith; and a verbal defect might introduce into the Latin
      theology a long train of error or perplexity. 74 But as the
      western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their
      religion from an orthodox source, they preserved with steadiness
      the doctrine which they had accepted with docility; and when the
      Arian pestilence approached their frontiers, they were supplied
      with the seasonable preservative of the Homoousion, by the
      paternal care of the Roman pontiff. Their sentiments and their
      temper were displayed in the memorable synod of Rimini, which
      surpassed in numbers the council of Nice, since it was composed
      of above four hundred bishops of Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul,
      Britain, and Illyricum. From the first debates it appeared, that
      only fourscore prelates adhered to the party, though _they_
      affected to anathematize the name and memory, of Arius. But this
      inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill, of
      experience, and of discipline; and the minority was conducted by
      Valens and Ursacius, two bishops of Illyricum, who had spent
      their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils, and who had
      been trained under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of
      the East. By their arguments and negotiations, they embarrassed,
      they confounded, they at last deceived, the honest simplicity of
      the Latin bishops; who suffered the palladium of the faith to be
      extorted from their hand by fraud and importunity, rather than by
      open violence. The council of Rimini was not allowed to separate,
      till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed, in
      which some expressions, susceptible of an heretical sense, were
      inserted in the room of the Homoousion. It was on this occasion,
      that, according to Jerom, the world was surprised to find itself
      Arian. 75 But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner
      reached their respective dioceses, than they discovered their
      mistake, and repented of their weakness. The ignominious
      capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence; and the
      Homoousian standard, which had been shaken but not overthrown,
      was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the West. 76

      Chapter XXI: Persecution Of Heresy, State Of The Church.—Part IV.


      Such was the rise and progress, and such were the natural
      revolutions of those theological disputes, which disturbed the
      peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine and of his
      sons. But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism
      over the faith, as well as over the lives and fortunes, of their
      subjects, the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the
      ecclesiastical balance: and the prerogatives of the King of
      Heaven were settled, or changed, or modified, in the cabinet of
      an earthly monarch. The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded
      the provinces of the East, interrupted the triumph of
      Constantine; but the emperor continued for some time to view,
      with cool and careless indifference, the object of the dispute.
      As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the
      quarrels of theologians, he addressed to the contending parties,
      to Alexander and to Arius, a moderating epistle; 77 which may be
      ascribed, with far greater reason, to the untutored sense of a
      soldier and statesman, than to the dictates of any of his
      episcopal counsellors. He attributes the origin of the whole
      controversy to a trifling and subtle question, concerning an
      incomprehensible point of law, which was foolishly asked by the
      bishop, and imprudently resolved by the presbyter. He laments
      that the Christian people, who had the same God, the same
      religion, and the same worship, should be divided by such
      inconsiderable distinctions; and he seriously recommends to the
      clergy of Alexandria the example of the Greek philosophers; who
      could maintain their arguments without losing their temper, and
      assert their freedom without violating their friendship. The
      indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been,
      perhaps, the most effectual method of silencing the dispute, if
      the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous, and if
      Constantine himself, in the midst of faction and fanaticism,
      could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind. But his
      ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the
      impartiality of the magistrate, and to awaken the zeal of the
      proselyte. He was provoked by the insults which had been offered
      to his statues; he was alarmed by the real, as well as the
      imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief; and he
      extinguished the hope of peace and toleration, from the moment
      that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the
      same palace. The presence of the monarch swelled the importance
      of the debate; his attention multiplied the arguments; and he
      exposed his person with a patient intrepidity, which animated the
      valor of the combatants. Notwithstanding the applause which has
      been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine, 78 a
      Roman general, whose religion might be still a subject of doubt,
      and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by
      inspiration, was indifferently qualified to discuss, in the Greek
      language, a metaphysical question, or an article of faith. But
      the credit of his favorite Osius, who appears to have presided in
      the council of Nice, might dispose the emperor in favor of the
      orthodox party; and a well-timed insinuation, that the same
      Eusebius of Nicomedia, who now protected the heretic, had lately
      assisted the tyrant, 79 might exasperate him against their
      adversaries. The Nicene creed was ratified by Constantine; and
      his firm declaration, that those who resisted the divine judgment
      of the synod, must prepare themselves for an immediate exile,
      annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition; which, from
      seventeen, was almost instantly reduced to two, protesting
      bishops. Eusebius of Cæsarea yielded a reluctant and ambiguous
      consent to the Homoousion; 80 and the wavering conduct of the
      Nicomedian Eusebius served only to delay, about three months, his
      disgrace and exile. 81 The impious Arius was banished into one of
      the remote provinces of Illyricum; his person and disciples were
      branded by law with the odious name of Porphyrians; his writings
      were condemned to the flames, and a capital punishment was
      denounced against those in whose possession they should be found.
      The emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy, and the
      angry, sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his
      subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the
      enemies of Christ. 82

      But, as if the conduct of the emperor had been guided by passion
      instead of principle, three years from the council of Nice were
      scarcely elapsed before he discovered some symptoms of mercy, and
      even of indulgence, towards the proscribed sect, which was
      secretly protected by his favorite sister. The exiles were
      recalled, and Eusebius, who gradually resumed his influence over
      the mind of Constantine, was restored to the episcopal throne,
      from which he had been ignominiously degraded. Arius himself was
      treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been
      due to an innocent and oppressed man. His faith was approved by
      the synod of Jerusalem; and the emperor seemed impatient to
      repair his injustice, by issuing an absolute command, that he
      should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of
      Constantinople. On the same day, which had been fixed for the
      triumph of Arius, he expired; and the strange and horrid
      circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion, that the
      orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their
      prayers, to deliver the church from the most formidable of her
      enemies. 83 The three principal leaders of the Catholics,
      Athanasius of Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch, and Paul of
      Constantinople were deposed on various f accusations, by the
      sentence of numerous councils; and were afterwards banished into
      distant provinces by the first of the Christian emperors, who, in
      the last moments of his life, received the rites of baptism from
      the Arian bishop of Nicomedia. The ecclesiastical government of
      Constantine cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and
      weakness. But the credulous monarch, unskilled in the stratagems
      of theological warfare, might be deceived by the modest and
      specious professions of the heretics, whose sentiments he never
      perfectly understood; and while he protected Arius, and
      persecuted Athanasius, he still considered the council of Nice as
      the bulwark of the Christian faith, and the peculiar glory of his
      own reign. 84

      dangerous to invent. Those who press the literal narrative of the
      death of Arius (his bowels suddenly burst out in a privy) must
      make their option between _poison_ and _miracle_.]

      writers was too near the scene of action, and the others were too
      remote from it. It is singular enough, that the important task of
      continuing the history of the church should have been left for
      two laymen and a heretic.]

      The sons of Constantine must have been admitted from their
      childhood into the rank of catechumens; but they imitated, in the
      delay of their baptism, the example of their father. Like him
      they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which
      they had never been regularly initiated; 85 and the fate of the
      Trinitarian controversy depended, in a great measure, on the
      sentiments of Constantius; who inherited the provinces of the
      East, and acquired the possession of the whole empire. The Arian
      presbyter or bishop, who had secreted for his use the testament
      of the deceased emperor, improved the fortunate occasion which
      had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince, whose public
      counsels were always swayed by his domestic favorites. The
      eunuchs and slaves diffused the spiritual poison through the
      palace, and the dangerous infection was communicated by the
      female attendants to the guards, and by the empress to her
      unsuspicious husband. 86 The partiality which Constantius always
      expressed towards the Eusebian faction, was insensibly fortified
      by the dexterous management of their leaders; and his victory
      over the tyrant Magnentius increased his inclination, as well as
      ability, to employ the arms of power in the cause of Arianism.
      While the two armies were engaged in the plains of Mursa, and the
      fate of the two rivals depended on the chance of war, the son of
      Constantine passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs
      under the walls of the city. His spiritual comforter, Valens, the
      Arian bishop of the diocese, employed the most artful precautions
      to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his
      favor or his escape. A secret chain of swift and trusty
      messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle; and
      while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted
      master, Valens assured him that the Gallic legions gave way; and
      insinuated with some presence of mind, that the glorious event
      had been revealed to him by an angel. The grateful emperor
      ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop
      of Mursa, whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous
      approbation of Heaven. 87 The Arians, who considered as their own
      the victory of Constantius, preferred his glory to that of his
      father. 88 Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, immediately composed the
      description of a celestial cross, encircled with a splendid
      rainbow; which during the festival of Pentecost, about the third
      hour of the day, had appeared over the Mount of Olives, to the
      edification of the devout pilgrims, and the people of the holy
      city. 89 The size of the meteor was gradually magnified; and the
      Arian historian has ventured to affirm, that it was conspicuous
      to the two armies in the plains of Pannonia; and that the tyrant,
      who is purposely represented as an idolater, fled before the
      auspicious sign of orthodox Christianity. 90

      The sentiments of a judicious stranger, who has impartially
      considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord, are
      always entitled to our notice; and a short passage of Ammianus,
      who served in the armies, and studied the character of
      Constantius, is perhaps of more value than many pages of
      theological invectives. “The Christian religion, which, in
      itself,” says that moderate historian, “is plain and simple, _he_
      confounded by the dotage of superstition. Instead of reconciling
      the parties by the weight of his authority, he cherished and
      promulgated, by verbal disputes, the differences which his vain
      curiosity had excited. The highways were covered with troops of
      bishops galloping from every side to the assemblies, which they
      call synods; and while they labored to reduce the whole sect to
      their own particular opinions, the public establishment of the
      posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys.” 91
      Our more intimate knowledge of the ecclesiastical transactions of
      the reign of Constantius would furnish an ample commentary on
      this remarkable passage, which justifies the rational
      apprehensions of Athanasius, that the restless activity of the
      clergy, who wandered round the empire in search of the true
      faith, would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving
      world. 92 As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of
      the civil war, he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at
      Arles, Milan, Sirmium, and Constantinople, to the amusement or
      toils of controversy: the sword of the magistrate, and even of
      the tyrant, was unsheathed, to enforce the reasons of the
      theologian; and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice, it is
      readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to
      his presumption. 93 The eunuchs, the women, and the bishops, who
      governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor, had inspired
      him with an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion; but his timid
      conscience was alarmed by the impiety of Ætius. The guilt of that
      atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favor of the unfortunate
      Gallus; and even the death of the Imperial ministers, who had
      been massacred at Antioch, were imputed to the suggestions of
      that dangerous sophist. The mind of Constantius, which could
      neither be moderated by reason, nor fixed by faith, was blindly
      impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss, by his
      horror of the opposite extreme; he alternately embraced and
      condemned the sentiments, he successively banished and recalled
      the leaders, of the Arian and Semi-Arian factions. 94 During the
      season of public business or festivity, he employed whole days,
      and even nights, in selecting the words, and weighing the
      syllables, which composed his fluctuating creeds. The subject of
      his meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers: the
      incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial
      visions, and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of
      bishop of bishops, from those ecclesiastics who forgot the
      interest of their order for the gratification of their passions.
      The design of establishing a uniformity of doctrine, which had
      engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul, Italy, Illyricum,
      and Asia, was repeatedly baffled by his own levity, by the
      divisions of the Arians, and by the resistance of the Catholics;
      and he resolved, as the last and decisive effort, imperiously to
      dictate the decrees of a general council. The destructive
      earthquake of Nicomedia, the difficulty of finding a convenient
      place, and perhaps some secret motives of policy, produced an
      alteration in the summons. The bishops of the East were directed
      to meet at Seleucia, in Isauria; while those of the West held
      their deliberations at Rimini, on the coast of the Hadriatic; and
      instead of two or three deputies from each province, the whole
      episcopal body was ordered to march. The Eastern council, after
      consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate, separated
      without any definitive conclusion. The council of the West was
      protracted till the seventh month. Taurus, the Prætorian præfect
      was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all
      be united in the same opinion; and his efforts were supported by
      the power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory, and a
      promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an
      adventure. His prayers and threats, the authority of the
      sovereign, the sophistry of Valens and Ursacius, the distress of
      cold and hunger, and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile,
      at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of
      Rimini. The deputies of the East and of the West attended the
      emperor in the palace of Constantinople, and he enjoyed the
      satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which
      established the _likeness_, without expressing the
      _consubstantiality_, of the Son of God. 95 But the triumph of
      Arianism had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy,
      whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt; and
      the reign of Constantius was disgraced by the unjust and
      ineffectual persecution of the great Athanasius.

      We have seldom an opportunity of observing, either in active or
      speculative life, what effect may be produced, or what obstacles
      may be surmounted, by the force of a single mind, when it is
      inflexibly applied to the pursuit of a single object. The
      immortal name of Athanasius 96 will never be separated from the
      Catholic doctrine of the Trinity, to whose defence he consecrated
      every moment and every faculty of his being. Educated in the
      family of Alexander, he had vigorously opposed the early progress
      of the Arian heresy: he exercised the important functions of
      secretary under the aged prelate; and the fathers of the Nicene
      council beheld with surprise and respect the rising virtues of
      the young deacon. In a time of public danger, the dull claims of
      age and of rank are sometimes superseded; and within five months
      after his return from Nice, the deacon Athanasius was seated on
      the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt. He filled that eminent
      station above forty-six years, and his long administration was
      spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of Arianism. Five
      times was Athanasius expelled from his throne; twenty years he
      passed as an exile or a fugitive: and almost every province of
      the Roman empire was successively witness to his merit, and his
      sufferings in the cause of the Homoousion, which he considered as
      the sole pleasure and business, as the duty, and as the glory of
      his life. Amidst the storms of persecution, the archbishop of
      Alexandria was patient of labor, jealous of fame, careless of
      safety; and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of
      fanaticism, Athanasius displayed a superiority of character and
      abilities, which would have qualified him, far better than the
      degenerate sons of Constantine, for the government of a great
      monarchy. His learning was much less profound and extensive than
      that of Eusebius of Cæsarea, and his rude eloquence could not be
      compared with the polished oratory of Gregory of Basil; but
      whenever the primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his
      sentiments, or his conduct, his unpremeditated style, either of
      speaking or writing, was clear, forcible, and persuasive. He has
      always been revered, in the orthodox school, as one of the most
      accurate masters of the Christian theology; and he was supposed
      to possess two profane sciences, less adapted to the episcopal
      character, the knowledge of jurisprudence, 97 and that of
      divination. 98 Some fortunate conjectures of future events, which
      impartial reasoners might ascribe to the experience and judgment
      of Athanasius, were attributed by his friends to heavenly
      inspiration, and imputed by his enemies to infernal magic.

      giving himself the trouble to consult the writings of Athanasius.

      Theodoret, connect the life of Athanasius with the series of
      ecclesiastical history. The diligence of Tillemont, (tom. viii,)

      is related by Sozomen, (l. iv c. 10,) which evidently proves (if
      the crows speak Latin) that Athanasius understood the language of
      the crows.]

      But as Athanasius was continually engaged with the prejudices and
      passions of every order of men, from the monk to the emperor, the
      knowledge of human nature was his first and most important
      science. He preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene
      which was incessantly shifting; and never failed to improve those
      decisive moments which are irrecoverably past before they are
      perceived by a common eye. The archbishop of Alexandria was
      capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command, and
      where he must dexterously insinuate; how long he might contend
      with power, and when he must withdraw from persecution; and while
      he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and
      rebellion, he could assume, in the bosom of his own party, the
      flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader. The election
      of Athanasius has not escaped the reproach of irregularity and
      precipitation; 99 but the propriety of his behavior conciliated
      the affections both of the clergy and of the people. The
      Alexandrians were impatient to rise in arms for the defence of an
      eloquent and liberal pastor. In his distress he always derived
      support, or at least consolation, from the faithful attachment of
      his parochial clergy; and the hundred bishops of Egypt adhered,
      with unshaken zeal, to the cause of Athanasius. In the modest
      equipage which pride and policy would affect, he frequently
      performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces, from the
      mouth of the Nile to the confines of Æthiopia; familiarly
      conversing with the meanest of the populace, and humbly saluting
      the saints and hermits of the desert. 100 Nor was it only in
      ecclesiastical assemblies, among men whose education and manners
      were similar to his own, that Athanasius displayed the ascendancy
      of his genius. He appeared with easy and respectful firmness in
      the courts of princes; and in the various turns of his prosperous
      and adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends,
      or the esteem of his enemies.

      prophesied the mischiefs of the Arian heresy Athanas. tom. ii. p.

      In his youth, the primate of Egypt resisted the great
      Constantine, who had repeatedly signified his will, that Arius
      should be restored to the Catholic communion. 101 The emperor
      respected, and might forgive, this inflexible resolution; and the
      faction who considered Athanasius as their most formidable enemy,
      was constrained to dissemble their hatred, and silently to
      prepare an indirect and distant assault. They scattered rumors
      and suspicions, represented the archbishop as a proud and
      oppressive tyrant, and boldly accused him of violating the treaty
      which had been ratified in the Nicene council, with the
      schismatic followers of Meletius. 102 Athanasius had openly
      disapproved that ignominious peace, and the emperor was disposed
      to believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power,
      to prosecute those odious sectaries: that he had sacrilegiously
      broken a chalice in one of their churches of Mareotis; that he
      had whipped or imprisoned six of their bishops; and that
      Arsenius, a seventh bishop of the same party, had been murdered,
      or at least mutilated, by the cruel hand of the primate. 103
      These charges, which affected his honor and his life, were
      referred by Constantine to his brother Dalmatius the censor, who
      resided at Antioch; the synods of Cæsarea and Tyre were
      successively convened; and the bishops of the East were
      instructed to judge the cause of Athanasius, before they
      proceeded to consecrate the new church of the Resurrection at
      Jerusalem. The primate might be conscious of his innocence; but
      he was sensible that the same implacable spirit which had
      dictated the accusation, would direct the proceeding, and
      pronounce the sentence. He prudently declined the tribunal of his
      enemies; despised the summons of the synod of Cæsarea; and, after
      a long and artful delay, submitted to the peremptory commands of
      the emperor, who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience
      if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre. 104 Before
      Athanasius, at the head of fifty Egyptian prelates, sailed from
      Alexandria, he had wisely secured the alliance of the Meletians;
      and Arsenius himself, his imaginary victim, and his secret
      friend, was privately concealed in his train. The synod of Tyre
      was conducted by Eusebius of Cæsarea, with more passion, and with
      less art, than his learning and experience might promise; his
      numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant; and
      their clamors were encouraged by the seeming patience of
      Athanasius, who expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius
      alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly. The nature of the
      other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory
      replies; yet the archbishop was able to prove, that in the
      village, where he was accused of breaking a consecrated chalice,
      neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist.

      The Arians, who had secretly determined the guilt and
      condemnation of their enemy, attempted, however, to disguise
      their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms: the synod
      appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect
      evidence on the spot; and this measure which was vigorously
      opposed by the Egyptian bishops, opened new scenes of violence
      and perjury. 105 After the return of the deputies from
      Alexandria, the majority of the council pronounced the final
      sentence of degradation and exile against the primate of Egypt.
      The decree, expressed in the fiercest language of malice and
      revenge, was communicated to the emperor and the Catholic church;
      and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect,
      such as became their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ.

      But the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been
      countenanced by the submission, or even by the presence, of
      Athanasius. He resolved to make a bold and dangerous experiment,

      sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street
      of Constantinople. So strange an apparition excited his surprise
      and indignation; and the guards were ordered to remove the
      importunate suitor; but his resentment was subdued by involuntary
      respect; and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the
      courage and eloquence of a bishop, who implored his justice and
      awakened his conscience. 107 Constantine listened to the
      complaints of Athanasius with impartial and even gracious
      attention; the members of the synod of Tyre were summoned to
      justify their proceedings; and the arts of the Eusebian faction
      would have been confounded, if they had not aggravated the guilt
      of the primate, by the dexterous supposition of an unpardonable
      offence; a criminal design to intercept and detain the corn-fleet
      of Alexandria, which supplied the subsistence of the new capital.
      108 The emperor was satisfied that the peace of Egypt would be
      secured by the absence of a popular leader; but he refused to
      fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne; and the sentence,
      which, after long hesitation, he pronounced, was that of a
      jealous ostracism, rather than of an ignominious exile. In the
      remote province of Gaul, but in the hospitable court of Treves,
      Athanasius passed about twenty eight months. The death of the
      emperor changed the face of public affairs and, amidst the
      general indulgence of a young reign, the primate was restored to
      his country by an honorable edict of the younger Constantine, who
      expressed a deep sense of the innocence and merit of his
      venerable guest. 109

      cruelty and credulity of Constantine on a similar occasion. The
      eloquent Sopater, a Syrian philosopher, enjoyed his friendship,
      and provoked the resentment of Ablavius, his Prætorian præfect.
      The corn-fleet was detained for want of a south wind; the people
      of Constantinople were discontented; and Sopater was beheaded, on
      a charge that he had _bound_ the winds by the power of magic.
      Suidas adds, that Constantine wished to prove, by this execution,
      that he had absolutely renounced the superstition of the
      Gentiles.]

      109 (return) [ In his return he saw Constantius twice, at
      Viminiacum, and at Cæsarea in Cappadocia, (Athanas. tom. i. p.
      676.) Tillemont supposes that Constantine introduced him to the
      meeting of the three royal brothers in Pannonia, (Mémoires
      Eccles. tom. viii. p. 69.)]

      The death of that prince exposed Athanasius to a second
      persecution; and the feeble Constantius, the sovereign of the
      East, soon became the secret accomplice of the Eusebians. Ninety
      bishops of that sect or faction assembled at Antioch, under the
      specious pretence of dedicating the cathedral. They composed an
      ambiguous creed, which is faintly tinged with the colors of
      Semi-Arianism, and twenty-five canons, which still regulate the
      discipline of the orthodox Greeks. 110 It was decided, with some
      appearance of equity, that a bishop, deprived by a synod, should
      not resume his episcopal functions till he had been absolved by
      the judgment of an equal synod; the law was immediately applied
      to the case of Athanasius; the council of Antioch pronounced, or
      rather confirmed, his degradation: a stranger, named Gregory, was
      seated on his throne; and Philagrius, 111 the præfect of Egypt,
      was instructed to support the new primate with the civil and
      military powers of the province. Oppressed by the conspiracy of
      the Asiatic prelates, Athanasius withdrew from Alexandria, and
      passed three years 112 as an exile and a suppliant on the holy
      threshold of the Vatican. 113 By the assiduous study of the Latin
      language, he soon qualified himself to negotiate with the western
      clergy; his decent flattery swayed and directed the haughty
      Julius; the Roman pontiff was persuaded to consider his appeal as
      the peculiar interest of the Apostolic see: and his innocence was
      unanimously declared in a council of fifty bishops of Italy. At
      the end of three years, the primate was summoned to the court of
      Milan by the emperor Constans, who, in the indulgence of unlawful
      pleasures, still professed a lively regard for the orthodox
      faith. The cause of truth and justice was promoted by the
      influence of gold, 114 and the ministers of Constans advised
      their sovereign to require the convocation of an ecclesiastical
      assembly, which might act as the representatives of the Catholic
      church. Ninety-four bishops of the West, seventy-six bishops of
      the East, encountered each other at Sardica, on the verge of the
      two empires, but in the dominions of the protector of Athanasius.
      Their debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations; the
      Asiatics, apprehensive for their personal safety, retired to
      Philippopolis in Thrace; and the rival synods reciprocally hurled
      their spiritual thunders against their enemies, whom they piously
      condemned as the enemies of the true God. Their decrees were
      published and ratified in their respective provinces: and
      Athanasius, who in the West was revered as a saint, was exposed
      as a criminal to the abhorrence of the East. 115 The council of
      Sardica reveals the first symptoms of discord and schism between
      the Greek and Latin churches which were separated by the
      accidental difference of faith, and the permanent distinction of
      language.

      During his second exile in the West, Athanasius was frequently
      admitted to the Imperial presence; at Capua, Lodi, Milan, Verona,
      Padua, Aquileia, and Treves. The bishop of the diocese usually
      assisted at these interviews; the master of the offices stood
      before the veil or curtain of the sacred apartment; and the
      uniform moderation of the primate might be attested by these
      respectable witnesses, to whose evidence he solemnly appeals. 116
      Prudence would undoubtedly suggest the mild and respectful tone
      that became a subject and a bishop. In these familiar conferences
      with the sovereign of the West, Athanasius might lament the error
      of Constantius, but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his eunuchs
      and his Arian prelates; deplored the distress and danger of the
      Catholic church; and excited Constans to emulate the zeal and
      glory of his father. The emperor declared his resolution of
      employing the troops and treasures of Europe in the orthodox
      cause; and signified, by a concise and peremptory epistle to his
      brother Constantius, that unless he consented to the immediate
      restoration of Athanasius, he himself, with a fleet and army,
      would seat the archbishop on the throne of Alexandria. 117 But
      this religious war, so horrible to nature, was prevented by the
      timely compliance of Constantius; and the emperor of the East
      condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject whom he
      had injured. Athanasius waited with decent pride, till he had
      received three successive epistles full of the strongest
      assurances of the protection, the favor, and the esteem of his
      sovereign; who invited him to resume his episcopal seat, and who
      added the humiliating precaution of engaging his principal
      ministers to attest the sincerity of his intentions. They were
      manifested in a still more public manner, by the strict orders
      which were despatched into Egypt to recall the adherents of
      Athanasius, to restore their privileges, to proclaim their
      innocence, and to erase from the public registers the illegal
      proceedings which had been obtained during the prevalence of the
      Eusebian faction. After every satisfaction and security had been
      given, which justice or even delicacy could require, the primate
      proceeded, by slow journeys, through the provinces of Thrace,
      Asia, and Syria; and his progress was marked by the abject homage
      of the Oriental bishops, who excited his contempt without
      deceiving his penetration. 118 At Antioch he saw the emperor
      Constantius; sustained, with modest firmness, the embraces and
      protestations of his master, and eluded the proposal of allowing
      the Arians a single church at Alexandria, by claiming, in the
      other cities of the empire, a similar toleration for his own
      party; a reply which might have appeared just and moderate in the
      mouth of an independent prince. The entrance of the archbishop
      into his capital was a triumphal procession; absence and
      persecution had endeared him to the Alexandrians; his authority,
      which he exercised with rigor, was more firmly established; and
      his fame was diffused from Æthiopia to Britain, over the whole
      extent of the Christian world. 119

      116 (return) [ As Athanasius dispersed secret invectives against

      that he assured him of his profound respect, we might distrust

      the retraction of Ursacius and Valens, (Athanas. tom. i. p. 776.)

      himself, are of so different a cast from each other, that they
      cannot both be genuine. The one speaks the language of criminals
      who confess their guilt and infamy; the other of enemies, who
      solicit on equal terms an honorable reconciliation. * Note: I
      cannot quite comprehend the ground of Gibbon’s doubts. Athanasius
      distinctly asserts the fact of their retractation. (Athan. Op. i.
      p. 124, edit. Benedict.) The epistles are apparently translations
      from the Latin, if, in fact, more than the substance of the
      epistles. That to Athanasius is brief, almost abrupt. Their
      retractation is likewise mentioned in the address of the orthodox
      bishops of Rimini to Constantius. Athan. de Synodis, Op t. i. p

      But the subject who has reduced his prince to the necessity of
      dissembling, can never expect a sincere and lasting forgiveness;
      and the tragic fate of Constans soon deprived Athanasius of a
      powerful and generous protector. The civil war between the
      assassin and the only surviving brother of Constans, which
      afflicted the empire above three years, secured an interval of
      repose to the Catholic church; and the two contending parties
      were desirous to conciliate the friendship of a bishop, who, by
      the weight of his personal authority, might determine the
      fluctuating resolutions of an important province. He gave
      audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant, with whom he was
      afterwards accused of holding a secret correspondence; 120 and
      the emperor Constantius repeatedly assured his dearest father,
      the most reverend Athanasius, that, notwithstanding the malicious
      rumors which were circulated by their common enemies, he had
      inherited the sentiments, as well as the throne, of his deceased
      brother. 121 Gratitude and humanity would have disposed the
      primate of Egypt to deplore the untimely fate of Constans, and to
      abhor the guilt of Magnentius; but as he clearly understood that
      the apprehensions of Constantius were his only safeguard, the
      fervor of his prayers for the success of the righteous cause
      might perhaps be somewhat abated. The ruin of Athanasius was no
      longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry
      bishops, who abused the authority of a credulous monarch. The
      monarch himself avowed the resolution, which he had so long
      suppressed, of avenging his private injuries; 122 and the first
      winter after his victory, which he passed at Arles, was employed
      against an enemy more odious to him than the vanquished tyrant of
      Gaul.

      120 (return) [ Athanasius (tom. i. p. 677, 678) defends his
      innocence by pathetic complaints, solemn assertions, and specious
      arguments. He admits that letters had been forged in his name,
      but he requests that his own secretaries and those of the tyrant
      might be examined, whether those letters had been written by the
      former, or received by the latter.]

      The emperor declared that he was more desirous to subdue
      Athanasius, than he had been to vanquish Magnentius or Sylvanus.]

      If the emperor had capriciously decreed the death of the most
      eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic, the cruel order
      would have been executed without hesitation, by the ministers of
      open violence or of specious injustice. The caution, the delay,
      the difficulty with which he proceeded in the condemnation and
      punishment of a popular bishop, discovered to the world that the
      privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and
      freedom in the Roman government. The sentence which was
      pronounced in the synod of Tyre, and subscribed by a large
      majority of the Eastern bishops, had never been expressly
      repealed; and as Athanasius had been once degraded from his
      episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren, every
      subsequent act might be considered as irregular, and even
      criminal. But the memory of the firm and effectual support which
      the primate of Egypt had derived from the attachment of the
      Western church, engaged Constantius to suspend the execution of
      the sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the Latin
      bishops. Two years were consumed in ecclesiastical negotiations;
      and the important cause between the emperor and one of his
      subjects was solemnly debated, first in the synod of Arles, and
      afterwards in the great council of Milan, 123 which consisted of
      above three hundred bishops. Their integrity was gradually
      undermined by the arguments of the Arians, the dexterity of the
      eunuchs, and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified
      his revenge at the expense of his dignity, and exposed his own
      passions, whilst he influenced those of the clergy. Corruption,
      the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty, was
      successfully practised; honors, gifts, and immunities were
      offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote; 124 and
      the condemnation of the Alexandrian primate was artfully
      represented as the only measure which could restore the peace and
      union of the Catholic church. The friends of Athanasius were not,
      however, wanting to their leader, or to their cause. With a manly
      spirit, which the sanctity of their character rendered less
      dangerous, they maintained, in public debate, and in private
      conference with the emperor, the eternal obligation of religion
      and justice. They declared, that neither the hope of his favor,
      nor the fear of his displeasure, should prevail on them to join
      in the condemnation of an absent, an innocent, a respectable
      brother. 125 They affirmed, with apparent reason, that the
      illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of Tyre had long
      since been tacitly abolished by the Imperial edicts, the
      honorable reestablishment of the archbishop of Alexandria, and
      the silence or recantation of his most clamorous adversaries.
      They alleged, that his innocence had been attested by the
      unanimous bishops of Egypt, and had been acknowledged in the
      councils of Rome and Sardica, 126 by the impartial judgment of
      the Latin church. They deplored the hard condition of Athanasius,
      who, after enjoying so many years his seat, his reputation, and
      the seeming confidence of his sovereign, was again called upon to
      confute the most groundless and extravagant accusations. Their
      language was specious; their conduct was honorable: but in this
      long and obstinate contest, which fixed the eyes of the whole
      empire on a single bishop, the ecclesiastical factions were
      prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more interesting
      object of defending or removing the intrepid champion of the
      Nicene faith. The Arians still thought it prudent to disguise, in
      ambiguous language, their real sentiments and designs; but the
      orthodox bishops, armed with the favor of the people, and the
      decrees of a general council, insisted on every occasion, and
      particularly at Milan, that their adversaries should purge
      themselves from the suspicion of heresy, before they presumed to
      arraign the conduct of the great Athanasius. 127

      But the voice of reason (if reason was indeed on the side of
      Athanasius) was silenced by the clamors of a factious or venal
      majority; and the councils of Arles and Milan were not dissolved,
      till the archbishop of Alexandria had been solemnly condemned and
      deposed by the judgment of the Western, as well as of the
      Eastern, church. The bishops who had opposed, were required to
      subscribe, the sentence, and to unite in religious communion with
      the suspected leaders of the adverse party. A formulary of
      consent was transmitted by the messengers of state to the absent
      bishops: and all those who refused to submit their private
      opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of
      Arles and Milan, were immediately banished by the emperor, who
      affected to execute the decrees of the Catholic church. Among
      those prelates who led the honorable band of confessors and
      exiles, Liberius of Rome, Osius of Cordova, Paulinus of Treves,
      Dionysius of Milan, Eusebius of Vercellæ, Lucifer of Cagliari and
      Hilary of Poitiers, may deserve to be particularly distinguished.
      The eminent station of Liberius, who governed the capital of the
      empire; the personal merit and long experience of the venerable
      Osius, who was revered as the favorite of the great Constantine,
      and the father of the Nicene faith, placed those prelates at the
      head of the Latin church: and their example, either of submission
      or resistance, would probable be imitated by the episcopal crowd.
      But the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to
      intimidate the bishops of Rome and Cordova, were for some time
      ineffectual. The Spaniard declared himself ready to suffer under
      Constantius, as he had suffered threescore years before under his
      grandfather Maximian. The Roman, in the presence of his
      sovereign, asserted the innocence of Athanasius and his own
      freedom. When he was banished to Beræa in Thrace, he sent back a
      large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his
      journey; and insulted the court of Milan by the haughty remark,
      that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay
      their soldiers and their bishops. 128 The resolution of Liberius
      and Osius was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and
      confinement. The Roman pontiff purchased his return by some
      criminal compliances; and afterwards expiated his guilt by a
      seasonable repentance. Persuasion and violence were employed to
      extort the reluctant signature of the decrepit bishop of Cordova,
      whose strength was broken, and whose faculties were perhaps
      impaired by the weight of a hundred years; and the insolent

      treat with inhuman severity the character, or rather the memory,
      of an unfortunate old man, to whose former services Christianity

      The fall of Liberius and Osius reflected a brighter lustre on the
      firmness of those bishops who still adhered, with unshaken
      fidelity, to the cause of Athanasius and religious truth. The
      ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the
      benefit of mutual comfort and advice, separated those illustrious
      exiles into distant provinces, and carefully selected the most
      inhospitable spots of a great empire. 130 Yet they soon
      experienced that the deserts of Libya, and the most barbarous
      tracts of Cappadocia, were less inhospitable than the residence
      of those cities in which an Arian bishop could satiate, without
      restraint, the exquisite rancor of theological hatred. 131 Their
      consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude and
      independence, from the applause, the visits, the letters, and the
      liberal alms of their adherents, 132 and from the satisfaction
      which they soon enjoyed of observing the intestine divisions of
      the adversaries of the Nicene faith. Such was the nice and
      capricious taste of the emperor Constantius; and so easily was he
      offended by the slightest deviation from his imaginary standard
      of Christian truth, that he persecuted, with equal zeal, those
      who defended the _consubstantiality_, those who asserted the
      _similar substance_, and those who denied the _likeness_ of the
      Son of God. Three bishops, degraded and banished for those
      adverse opinions, might possibly meet in the same place of exile;
      and, according to the difference of their temper, might either
      pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists, whose
      present sufferings would never be compensated by future

      The disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the West were
      designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of Athanasius
      himself. 133 Six-and-twenty months had elapsed, during which the
      Imperial court secretly labored, by the most insidious arts, to
      remove him from Alexandria, and to withdraw the allowance which
      supplied his popular liberality. But when the primate of Egypt,
      deserted and proscribed by the Latin church, was left destitute
      of any foreign support, Constantius despatched two of his
      secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the
      order of his banishment. As the justice of the sentence was
      publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive which could
      restrain Constantius from giving his messengers the sanction of a
      written mandate, must be imputed to his doubt of the event; and
      to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the second
      city, and the most fertile province, of the empire, if the people
      should persist in the resolution of defending, by force of arms,
      the innocence of their spiritual father. Such extreme caution
      afforded Athanasius a specious pretence respectfully to dispute
      the truth of an order, which he could not reconcile, either with
      the equity, or with the former declarations, of his gracious
      master. The civil powers of Egypt found themselves inadequate to
      the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his
      episcopal throne; and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with
      the popular leaders of Alexandria, by which it was stipulated,
      that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till
      the emperor’s pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained. By
      this seeming moderation, the Catholics were deceived into a false
      and fatal security; while the legions of the Upper Egypt, and of
      Libya, advanced, by secret orders and hasty marches, to besiege,
      or rather to surprise, a capital habituated to sedition, and
      inflamed by religious zeal. 134 The position of Alexandria,
      between the sea and the Lake Mareotis, facilitated the approach
      and landing of the troops; who were introduced into the heart of
      the city, before any effectual measures could be taken either to
      shut the gates or to occupy the important posts of defence. At
      the hour of midnight, twenty-three days after the signature of
      the treaty, Syrianus, duke of Egypt, at the head of five thousand
      soldiers, armed and prepared for an assault, unexpectedly
      invested the church of St. Theonas, where the archbishop, with a
      part of his clergy and people, performed their nocturnal
      devotions. The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the
      impetuosity of the attack, which was accompanied with every
      horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed; but, as the bodies
      of the slain, and the fragments of military weapons, remained the
      next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the
      Catholics, the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a
      successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest. The
      other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages;
      and, during at least four months, Alexandria was exposed to the
      insults of a licentious army, stimulated by the ecclesiastics of
      a hostile faction. Many of the faithful were killed; who may
      deserve the name of martyrs, if their deaths were neither
      provoked nor revenged; bishops and presbyters were treated with
      cruel ignominy; consecrated virgins were stripped naked, scourged
      and violated; the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered; and,
      under the mask of religious zeal, lust, avarice, and private
      resentment were gratified with impunity, and even with applause.
      The Pagans of Alexandria, who still formed a numerous and
      discontented party, were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom
      they feared and esteemed. The hopes of some peculiar favors, and
      the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of
      rebellion, engaged them to promise their support to the destined
      successor of Athanasius, the famous George of Cappadocia. The
      usurper, after receiving the consecration of an Arian synod, was
      placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian, who had
      been appointed Count of Egypt for the execution of that important
      design. In the use, as well as in the acquisition, of power, the
      tyrant, George disregarded the laws of religion, of justice, and
      of humanity; and the same scenes of violence and scandal which
      had been exhibited in the capital, were repeated in more than
      ninety episcopal cities of Egypt. Encouraged by success,
      Constantius ventured to approve the conduct of his minister. By a
      public and passionate epistle, the emperor congratulates the
      deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant, who deluded his
      blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence; expatiates on the
      virtues and piety of the most reverend George, the elected
      bishop; and aspires, as the patron and benefactor of the city to
      surpass the fame of Alexander himself. But he solemnly declares
      his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the
      seditious adherents of the wicked Athanasius, who, by flying from
      justice, has confessed his guilt, and escaped the ignominious
      death which he had so often deserved. 135

      Athanasius had indeed escaped from the most imminent dangers; and
      the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our
      attention. On the memorable night when the church of St. Theonas
      was invested by the troops of Syrianus, the archbishop, seated on
      his throne, expected, with calm and intrepid dignity, the
      approach of death. While the public devotion was interrupted by
      shouts of rage and cries of terror, he animated his trembling
      congregation to express their religious confidence, by chanting
      one of the psalms of David which celebrates the triumph of the
      God of Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt. The
      doors were at length burst open: a cloud of arrows was discharged
      among the people; the soldiers, with drawn swords, rushed
      forwards into the sanctuary; and the dreadful gleam of their arms
      was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar.
      136 Athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the monks
      and presbyters, who were attached to his person; and nobly
      refused to desert his episcopal station, till he had dismissed in
      safety the last of the congregation. The darkness and tumult of
      the night favored the retreat of the archbishop; and though he
      was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude, though he
      was thrown to the ground, and left without sense or motion, he
      still recovered his undaunted courage, and eluded the eager
      search of the soldiers, who were instructed by their Arian
      guides, that the head of Athanasius would be the most acceptable
      present to the emperor. From that moment the primate of Egypt
      disappeared from the eyes of his enemies, and remained above six
      years concealed in impenetrable obscurity. 137

      Arnauld, and have expatiated with pleasure on the faith and zeal,
      the merit and exile, of those celebrated doctors. This concealed
      parallel is very dexterously managed by the Abbé de la Bleterie,
      Vie de Jovien, tom. i. p. 130.]

      The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole
      extent of the Roman world; and the exasperated monarch had
      endeavored, by a very pressing epistle to the Christian princes
      of Ethiopia, 13711 to exclude Athanasius from the most remote and
      sequestered regions of the earth. Counts, præfects, tribunes,
      whole armies, were successively employed to pursue a bishop and a
      fugitive; the vigilance of the civil and military powers was
      excited by the Imperial edicts; liberal rewards were promised to
      the man who should produce Athanasius, either alive or dead; and
      the most severe penalties were denounced against those who should
      dare to protect the public enemy. 138 But the deserts of Thebais
      were now peopled by a race of wild, yet submissive fanatics, who
      preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their
      sovereign. The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachonnus
      received the fugitive primate as their father, admired the
      patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest
      institutions, collected every word which dropped from his lips as
      the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom; and persuaded
      themselves that their prayers, their fasts, and their vigils,
      were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed, and the
      dangers which they braved, in the defence of truth and innocence.
      139 The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate
      places, on the summit of mountains, or in the islands of the
      Nile; and the sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the
      well-known signal which assembled several thousand robust and
      determined monks, who, for the most part, had been the peasants
      of the adjacent country. When their dark retreats were invaded by
      a military force, which it was impossible to resist, they
      silently stretched out their necks to the executioner; and
      supported their national character, that tortures could never
      wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was
      resolved not to disclose. 140 The archbishop of Alexandria, for
      whose safety they eagerly devoted their lives, was lost among a
      uniform and well-disciplined multitude; and on the nearer
      approach of danger, he was swiftly removed, by their officious
      hands, from one place of concealment to another, till he reached
      the formidable deserts, which the gloomy and credulous temper of
      superstition had peopled with dæmons and savage monsters. The
      retirement of Athanasius, which ended only with the life of
      Constantius, was spent, for the most part, in the society of the
      monks, who faithfully served him as guards, as secretaries, and
      as messengers; but the importance of maintaining a more intimate
      connection with the Catholic party tempted him, whenever the
      diligence of the pursuit was abated, to emerge from the desert,
      to introduce himself into Alexandria, and to trust his person to
      the discretion of his friends and adherents. His various
      adventures might have furnished the subject of a very
      entertaining romance. He was once secreted in a dry cistern,
      which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the
      treachery of a female slave; 141 and he was once concealed in a
      still more extraordinary asylum, the house of a virgin, only
      twenty years of age, and who was celebrated in the whole city for
      her exquisite beauty. At the hour of midnight, as she related the
      story many years afterwards, she was surprised by the appearance
      of the archbishop in a loose undress, who, advancing with hasty
      steps, conjured her to afford him the protection which he had
      been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable
      roof. The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge
      which was intrusted to her prudence and courage. Without
      imparting the secret to any one, she instantly conducted
      Athanasius into her most secret chamber, and watched over his
      safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a
      servant. As long as the danger continued, she regularly supplied
      him with books and provisions, washed his feet, managed his
      correspondence, and dexterously concealed from the eye of
      suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint
      whose character required the most unblemished chastity, and a
      female whose charms might excite the most dangerous emotions. 142
      During the six years of persecution and exile, Athanasius
      repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion; and the
      formal declaration, that he _saw_ the councils of Rimini and
      Seleucia, 143 forces us to believe that he was secretly present
      at the time and place of their convocation. The advantage of
      personally negotiating with his friends, and of observing and
      improving the divisions of his enemies, might justify, in a
      prudent statesman, so bold and dangerous an enterprise: and
      Alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every
      seaport of the Mediterranean. From the depth of his inaccessible
      retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war
      against the protector of the Arians; and his seasonable writings,
      which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused, contributed
      to unite and animate the orthodox party. In his public apologies,
      which he addressed to the emperor himself, he sometimes affected
      the praise of moderation; whilst at the same time, in secret and
      vehement invectives, he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked
      prince, the executioner of his family, the tyrant of the
      republic, and the Antichrist of the church. In the height of his
      prosperity, the victorious monarch, who had chastised the
      rashness of Gallus, and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus, who
      had taken the diadem from the head of Vetranio, and vanquished in
      the field the legions of Magnentius, received from an invisible
      hand a wound, which he could neither heal nor revenge; and the
      son of Constantine was the first of the Christian princes who
      experienced the strength of those principles, which, in the cause
      of religion, could resist the most violent exertions 144 of the
      civil power.

      discovered, in the ruins of Axum, a long and very interesting
      inscription relating to these princes. It was erected to
      commemorate the victory of Aeizanas over the Bougaitæ, (St.
      Martin considers them the Blemmyes, whose true name is Bedjah or

      of Raeidan, of the Ethiopians, of the Sabsuites, of Silea, of
      Tiamo, of the Bougaites, and of Kaei. It appears that at this
      time the king of the Ethiopians ruled over the Homerites, the
      inhabitants of Yemen. He was not yet a Christian, as he calls
      himself son of the invincible Mars. Another brother besides
      Saiazanas, named Adephas, is mentioned, though Aeizanas seems to
      have been sole king. See St. Martin, note on Le Beau, ii. 151.

      The persecution of Athanasius, and of so many respectable
      bishops, who suffered for the truth of their opinions, or at
      least for the integrity of their conscience, was a just subject
      of indignation and discontent to all Christians, except those who
      were blindly devoted to the Arian faction. The people regretted
      the loss of their faithful pastors, whose banishment was usually
      followed by the intrusion of a stranger 145 into the episcopal
      chair; and loudly complained, that the right of election was
      violated, and that they were condemned to obey a mercenary
      usurper, whose person was unknown, and whose principles were
      suspected. The Catholics might prove to the world, that they were
      not involved in the guilt and heresy of their ecclesiastical
      governor, by publicly testifying their dissent, or by totally
      separating themselves from his communion. The first of these
      methods was invented at Antioch, and practised with such success,
      that it was soon diffused over the Christian world. The doxology
      or sacred hymn, which celebrates the _glory_ of the Trinity, is
      susceptible of very nice, but material, inflections; and the
      substance of an orthodox, or an heretical, creed, may be
      expressed by the difference of a disjunctive, or a copulative,
      particle. Alternate responses, and a more regular psalmody, 146
      were introduced into the public service by Flavianus and
      Diodorus, two devout and active laymen, who were attached to the
      Nicene faith. Under their conduct a swarm of monks issued from
      the adjacent desert, bands of well-disciplined singers were
      stationed in the cathedral of Antioch, the Glory to the Father,
      And the Son, And the Holy Ghost, 147 was triumphantly chanted by
      a full chorus of voices; and the Catholics insulted, by the
      purity of their doctrine, the Arian prelate, who had usurped the
      throne of the venerable Eustathius. The same zeal which inspired
      their songs prompted the more scrupulous members of the orthodox
      party to form separate assemblies, which were governed by the
      presbyters, till the death of their exiled bishop allowed the
      election and consecration of a new episcopal pastor. 148 The
      revolutions of the court multiplied the number of pretenders; and
      the same city was often disputed, under the reign of Constantius,
      by two, or three, or even four, bishops, who exercised their
      spiritual jurisdiction over their respective followers, and
      alternately lost and regained the temporal possessions of the
      church. The abuse of Christianity introduced into the Roman

      and fall of successive emperors, imagined and experienced, that

      fourscore years. See Tillemont, Mém. Eccles. tom. vii. p. 35-54,

      I. The Roman pontiff, as long as he maintained his station and
      his principles, was guarded by the warm attachment of a great
      people; and could reject with scorn the prayers, the menaces, and
      the oblations of an heretical prince. When the eunuchs had
      secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius, the well-grounded
      apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost
      precautions in the execution of the sentence. The capital was
      invested on every side, and the præfect was commanded to seize
      the person of the bishop, either by stratagem or by open force.
      The order was obeyed, and Liberius, with the greatest difficulty,
      at the hour of midnight, was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of
      the Roman people, before their consternation was turned into
      rage. As soon as they were informed of his banishment into
      Thrace, a general assembly was convened, and the clergy of Rome
      bound themselves, by a public and solemn oath, never to desert
      their bishop, never to acknowledge the usurper Fælix; who, by the
      influence of the eunuchs, had been irregularly chosen and
      consecrated within the walls of a profane palace. At the end of
      two years, their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken;
      and when Constantius visited Rome, he was assailed by the
      importunate solicitations of a people, who had preserved, as the
      last remnant of their ancient freedom, the right of treating
      their sovereign with familiar insolence. The wives of many of the
      senators and most honorable citizens, after pressing their
      husbands to intercede in favor of Liberius, were advised to
      undertake a commission, which in their hands would be less
      dangerous, and might prove more successful. The emperor received
      with politeness these female deputies, whose wealth and dignity
      were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments:
      he admired their inflexible resolution of following their beloved
      pastor to the most distant regions of the earth; and consented
      that the two bishops, Liberius and Fælix, should govern in peace
      their respective congregations. But the ideas of toleration were
      so repugnant to the practice, and even to the sentiments, of
      those times, that when the answer of Constantius was publicly
      read in the Circus of Rome, so reasonable a project of
      accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule. The eager
      vehemence which animated the spectators in the decisive moment of
      a horse-race, was now directed towards a different object; and
      the Circus resounded with the shout of thousands, who repeatedly
      exclaimed, “One God, One Christ, One Bishop!” The zeal of the
      Roman people in the cause of Liberius was not confined to words
      alone; and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited
      soon after the departure of Constantius determined that prince to
      accept the submission of the exiled prelate, and to restore him
      to the undivided dominion of the capital. After some ineffectual
      resistance, his rival was expelled from the city by the
      permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction;
      the adherents of Fælix were inhumanly murdered in the streets, in
      the public places, in the baths, and even in the churches; and
      the face of Rome, upon the return of a Christian bishop, renewed
      the horrid image of the massacres of Marius, and the
      proscriptions of Sylla. 149

      II. Notwithstanding the rapid increase of Christians under the
      reign of the Flavian family, Rome, Alexandria, and the other
      great cities of the empire, still contained a strong and powerful
      faction of Infidels, who envied the prosperity, and who
      ridiculed, even in their theatres, the theological disputes of
      the church. Constantinople alone enjoyed the advantage of being
      born and educated in the bosom of the faith. The capital of the
      East had never been polluted by the worship of idols; and the
      whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions, the
      virtues, and the passions, which distinguished the Christians of
      that age from the rest of mankind. After the death of Alexander,
      the episcopal throne was disputed by Paul and Macedonius. By
      their zeal and abilities they both deserved the eminent station
      to which they aspired; and if the moral character of Macedonius
      was less exceptionable, his competitor had the advantage of a
      prior election and a more orthodox doctrine. His firm attachment
      to the Nicene creed, which has given Paul a place in the calendar
      among saints and martyrs, exposed him to the resentment of the
      Arians. In the space of fourteen years he was five times driven
      from his throne; to which he was more frequently restored by the
      violence of the people, than by the permission of the prince; and
      the power of Macedonius could be secured only by the death of his
      rival. The unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy
      deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount
      Taurus, 150 confined in a dark and narrow dungeon, left six days
      without food, and at length strangled, by the order of Philip,
      one of the principal ministers of the emperor Constantius. 151
      The first blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this
      ecclesiastical contest; and many persons were slain on both
      sides, in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people. The
      commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against Paul had
      been intrusted to Hermogenes, the master-general of the cavalry;
      but the execution of it was fatal to himself. The Catholics rose
      in the defence of their bishop; the palace of Hermogenes was
      consumed; the first military officer of the empire was dragged by
      the heels through the streets of Constantinople, and, after he
      expired, his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults.
      152 The fate of Hermogenes instructed Philip, the Prætorian
      præfect, to act with more precaution on a similar occasion. In
      the most gentle and honorable terms, he required the attendance
      of Paul in the baths of Xeuxippus, which had a private
      communication with the palace and the sea. A vessel, which lay
      ready at the garden stairs, immediately hoisted sail; and, while
      the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege, their
      bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica. They
      soon beheld, with surprise and indignation, the gates of the
      palace thrown open, and the usurper Macedonius seated by the side
      of the præfect on a lofty chariot, which was surrounded by troops
      of guards with drawn swords. The military procession advanced
      towards the cathedral; the Arians and the Catholics eagerly
      rushed to occupy that important post; and three thousand one
      hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of
      the tumult. Macedonius, who was supported by a regular force,
      obtained a decisive victory; but his reign was disturbed by
      clamor and sedition; and the causes which appeared the least
      connected with the subject of dispute, were sufficient to nourish
      and to kindle the flame of civil discord. As the chapel in which
      the body of the great Constantine had been deposited was in a
      ruinous condition, the bishop transported those venerable remains
      into the church of St. Acacius. This prudent and even pious
      measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole
      party which adhered to the Homoousian doctrine. The factions
      immediately flew to arms, the consecrated ground was used as
      their field of battle; and one of the ecclesiastical historians
      has observed, as a real fact, not as a figure of rhetoric, that
      the well before the church overflowed with a stream of blood,
      which filled the porticos and the adjacent courts. The writer who
      should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle,
      would betray a very imperfect knowledge of human nature; yet it
      must be confessed that the motive which misled the sincerity of
      zeal, and the pretence which disguised the licentiousness of
      passion, suppressed the remorse which, in another cause, would
      have succeeded to the rage of the Christians at Constantinople.

      Chapter XXI: Persecution Of Heresy, State Of The Church.—Part
      VII.


      The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius, which did not
      always require the provocations of guilt and resistance, was
      justly exasperated by the tumults of his capital, and the
      criminal behavior of a faction, which opposed the authority and
      religion of their sovereign. The ordinary punishments of death,
      exile, and confiscation, were inflicted with partial vigor; and
      the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks, a reader,
      and a sub-deacon, who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes,
      and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople. By an edict of
      Constantius against the Catholics which has not been judged
      worthy of a place in the Theodosian code, those who refused to
      communicate with the Arian bishops, and particularly with
      Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics, and
      of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to relinquish
      the possession of the churches; and were strictly prohibited from
      holding their assemblies within the walls of the city. The
      execution of this unjust law, in the provinces of Thrace and Asia
      Minor, was committed to the zeal of Macedonius; the civil and
      military powers were directed to obey his commands; and the
      cruelties exercised by this Semi- Arian tyrant in the support of
      the _Homoiousion_, exceeded the commission, and disgraced the
      reign, of Constantius. The sacraments of the church were
      administered to the reluctant victims, who denied the vocation,
      and abhorred the principles, of Macedonius. The rites of baptism
      were conferred on women and children, who, for that purpose, had
      been torn from the arms of their friends and parents; the mouths
      of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine, while the
      consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts of
      tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot egg-shells, or
      inhumanly compressed betweens harp and heavy boards. 154 The
      Novatians of Constantinople and the adjacent country, by their
      firm attachment to the Homoousian standard, deserved to be
      confounded with the Catholics themselves. Macedonius was
      informed, that a large district of Paphlagonia 155 was almost
      entirely inhabited by those sectaries. He resolved either to
      convert or to extirpate them; and as he distrusted, on this
      occasion, the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission, he commanded
      a body of four thousand legionaries to march against the rebels,
      and to reduce the territory of Mantinium under his spiritual
      dominion. The Novatian peasants, animated by despair and
      religious fury, boldly encountered the invaders of their country;
      and though many of the Paphlagonians were slain, the Roman
      legions were vanquished by an irregular multitude, armed only
      with scythes and axes; and, except a few who escaped by an
      ignominious flight, four thousand soldiers were left dead on the
      field of battle. The successor of Constantius has expressed, in a
      concise but lively manner, some of the theological calamities
      which afflicted the empire, and more especially the East, in the
      reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions, and of
      those of his eunuchs: “Many were imprisoned, and persecuted, and
      driven into exile. Whole troops of those who are styled heretics,
      were massacred, particularly at Cyzicus, and at Samosata. In
      Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Galatia, and in many other provinces,
      towns and villages were laid waste, and utterly destroyed.” 156

      difference between the _Homoousion_ and _Homoiousion_, is almost
      invisible to the nicest theological eye.]

      While the flames of the Arian controversy consumed the vitals of
      the empire, the African provinces were infested by their peculiar
      enemies, the savage fanatics, who, under the name of
      _Circumcellions_, formed the strength and scandal of the Donatist
      party. 157 The severe execution of the laws of Constantine had
      excited a spirit of discontent and resistance, the strenuous
      efforts of his son Constans, to restore the unity of the church,
      exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred, which had first
      occasioned the separation; and the methods of force and
      corruption employed by the two Imperial commissioners, Paul and
      Macarius, furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast
      between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their
      pretended successors. 158 The peasants who inhabited the villages
      of Numidia and Mauritania, were a ferocious race, who had been
      imperfectly reduced under the authority of the Roman laws; who
      were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith; but who were
      actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their
      Donatist teachers. They indignantly supported the exile of their
      bishops, the demolition of their churches, and the interruption
      of their secret assemblies. The violence of the officers of
      justice, who were usually sustained by a military guard, was
      sometimes repelled with equal violence; and the blood of some
      popular ecclesiastics, which had been shed in the quarrel,
      inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging
      the death of these holy martyrs. By their own cruelty and
      rashness, the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their
      fate; and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the
      criminals into despair and rebellion. Driven from their native
      villages, the Donatist peasants assembled in formidable gangs on
      the edge of the Getulian desert; and readily exchanged the habits
      of labor for a life of idleness and rapine, which was consecrated
      by the name of religion, and faintly condemned by the doctors of
      the sect. The leaders of the Circumcellions assumed the title of
      captains of the saints; their principal weapon, as they were
      indifferently provided with swords and spears, was a huge and
      weighty club, which they termed an _Israelite;_ and the
      well-known sound of “Praise be to God,” which they used as their
      cry of war, diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of
      Africa. At first their depredations were colored by the plea of
      necessity; but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence,
      indulged without control their intemperance and avarice, burnt
      the villages which they had pillaged, and reigned the licentious
      tyrants of the open country. The occupations of husbandry, and
      the administration of justice, were interrupted; and as the
      Circumcellions pretended to restore the primitive equality of
      mankind, and to reform the abuses of civil society, they opened a
      secure asylum for the slaves and debtors, who flocked in crowds
      to their holy standard. When they were not resisted, they usually
      contented themselves with plunder, but the slightest opposition
      provoked them to acts of violence and murder; and some Catholic
      priests, who had imprudently signalized their zeal, were tortured
      by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity. The
      spirit of the Circumcellions was not always exerted against their
      defenceless enemies; they engaged, and sometimes defeated, the
      troops of the province; and in the bloody action of Bagai, they
      attacked in the open field, but with unsuccessful valor, an
      advanced guard of the Imperial cavalry. The Donatists who were
      taken in arms, received, and they soon deserved, the same
      treatment which might have been shown to the wild beasts of the
      desert. The captives died, without a murmur, either by the sword,
      the axe, or the fire; and the measures of retaliation were
      multiplied in a rapid proportion, which aggravated the horrors of
      rebellion, and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness. In the
      beginning of the present century, the example of the
      Circumcellions has been renewed in the persecution, the boldness,
      the crimes, and the enthusiasm of the Camisards; and if the
      fanatics of Languedoc surpassed those of Numidia, by their
      military achievements, the Africans maintained their fierce
      independence with more resolution and perseverance. 159

      in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be paralleled in any
      country or in any age. Many of these fanatics were possessed with
      the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed

      perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of
      devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope

      festivals, and profaned the temples of Paganism, with the design
      of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the
      insulted honor of their gods. They sometimes forced their way
      into the courts of justice, and compelled the affrighted judge to
      give orders for their immediate execution. They frequently
      stopped travellers on the public highways, and obliged them to
      inflict the stroke of martyrdom, by the promise of a reward, if
      they consented, and by the threat of instant death, if they
      refused to grant so very singular a favor. When they were
      disappointed of every other resource, they announced the day on
      which, in the presence of their friends and brethren, they should
      cast themselves headlong from some lofty rock; and many
      precipices were shown, which had acquired fame by the number of
      religious suicides. In the actions of these desperate
      enthusiasts, who were admired by one party as the martyrs of God,
      and abhorred by the other as the victims of Satan, an impartial
      philosopher may discover the influence and the last abuse of that
      inflexible spirit which was originally derived from the character
      and principles of the Jewish nation.

      The simple narrative of the intestine divisions, which distracted
      the peace, and dishonored the triumph, of the church, will
      confirm the remark of a Pagan historian, and justify the
      complaint of a venerable bishop. The experience of Ammianus had
      convinced him, that the enmity of the Christians towards each
      other, surpassed the fury of savage beasts against man; 161 and
      Gregory Nazianzen most pathetically laments, that the kingdom of
      heaven was converted, by discord, into the image of chaos, of a
      nocturnal tempest, and of hell itself. 162 The fierce and partial
      writers of the times, ascribing _all_ virtue to themselves, and
      imputing _all_ guilt to their adversaries, have painted the
      battle of the angels and dæmons. Our calmer reason will reject
      such pure and perfect monsters of vice or sanctity, and will
      impute an equal, or at least an indiscriminate, measure of good
      and evil to the hostile sectaries, who assumed and bestowed the
      appellations of orthodox and heretics. They had been educated in
      the same religion and the same civil society. Their hopes and
      fears in the present, or in a future life, were balanced in the
      same proportion. On either side, the error might be innocent, the
      faith sincere, the practice meritorious or corrupt. Their
      passions were excited by similar objects; and they might
      alternately abuse the favor of the court, or of the people. The
      metaphysical opinions of the Athanasians and the Arians could not
      influence their moral character; and they were alike actuated by
      the intolerant spirit which has been extracted from the pure and
      simple maxims of the gospel.

      A modern writer, who, with a just confidence, has prefixed to his
      own history the honorable epithets of political and
      philosophical, 163 accuses the timid prudence of Montesquieu, for
      neglecting to enumerate, among the causes of the decline of the
      empire, a law of Constantine, by which the exercise of the Pagan
      worship was absolutely suppressed, and a considerable part of his
      subjects was left destitute of priests, of temples, and of any
      public religion. The zeal of the philosophic historian for the
      rights of mankind, has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous
      testimony of those ecclesiastics, who have too lightly ascribed
      to their favorite hero the _merit_ of a general persecution. 164
      Instead of alleging this imaginary law, which would have blazed
      in the front of the Imperial codes, we may safely appeal to the
      original epistle, which Constantine addressed to the followers of
      the ancient religion; at a time when he no longer disguised his
      conversion, nor dreaded the rivals of his throne. He invites and
      exhorts, in the most pressing terms, the subjects of the Roman
      empire to imitate the example of their master; but he declares,
      that those who still refuse to open their eyes to the celestial
      light, may freely enjoy their temples and their fancied gods. A
      report, that the ceremonies of paganism were suppressed, is
      formally contradicted by the emperor himself, who wisely assigns,
      as the principle of his moderation, the invincible force of
      habit, of prejudice, and of superstition. 165 Without violating
      the sanctity of his promise, without alarming the fears of the
      Pagans, the artful monarch advanced, by slow and cautious steps,
      to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheism. The
      partial acts of severity which he occasionally exercised, though
      they were secretly promoted by a Christian zeal, were colored by
      the fairest pretences of justice and the public good; and while
      Constantine designed to ruin the foundations, he seemed to reform
      the abuses, of the ancient religion. After the example of the
      wisest of his predecessors, he condemned, under the most rigorous
      penalties, the occult and impious arts of divination; which
      excited the vain hopes, and sometimes the criminal attempts, of
      those who were discontented with their present condition. An
      ignominious silence was imposed on the oracles, which had been
      publicly convicted of fraud and falsehood; the effeminate priests
      of the Nile were abolished; and Constantine discharged the duties
      of a Roman censor, when he gave orders for the demolition of
      several temples of Phœnicia; in which every mode of prostitution
      was devoutly practised in the face of day, and to the honor of
      Venus. 166 The Imperial city of Constantinople was, in some
      measure, raised at the expense, and was adorned with the spoils,
      of the opulent temples of Greece and Asia; the sacred property
      was confiscated; the statues of gods and heroes were transported,
      with rude familiarity, among a people who considered them as
      objects, not of adoration, but of curiosity; the gold and silver
      were restored to circulation; and the magistrates, the bishops,
      and the eunuchs, improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying,
      at once, their zeal, their avarice, and their resentment. But
      these depredations were confined to a small part of the Roman
      world; and the provinces had been long since accustomed to endure
      the same sacrilegious rapine, from the tyranny of princes and
      proconsuls, who could not be suspected of any design to subvert
      the established religion. 167

      worship; the temples indeed were impoverished, but the sacred
      rites were performed there.” Lardner’s Jewish and Heathen
      Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 140.]

      The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of their father,
      with more zeal, and with less discretion. The pretences of rapine
      and oppression were insensibly multiplied; 168 every indulgence
      was shown to the illegal behavior of the Christians; every doubt
      was explained to the disadvantage of Paganism; and the demolition
      of the temples was celebrated as one of the auspicious events of
      the reign of Constans and Constantius. 169 The name of
      Constantius is prefixed to a concise law, which might have
      superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions. “It is our
      pleasure, that in all places, and in all cities, the temples be
      immediately shut, and carefully guarded, that none may have the
      power of offending. It is likewise our pleasure, that all our
      subjects should abstain from sacrifices. If any one should be
      guilty of such an act, let him feel the sword of vengeance, and
      after his execution, let his property be confiscated to the
      public use. We denounce the same penalties against the governors
      of the provinces, if they neglect to punish the criminals.” 170
      But there is the strongest reason to believe, that this
      formidable edict was either composed without being published, or
      was published without being executed. The evidence of facts, and
      the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble,
      continue to prove the public exercise of the Pagan worship during
      the whole reign of the sons of Constantine. In the East, as well
      as in the West, in cities, as well as in the country, a great
      number of temples were respected, or at least were spared; and
      the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices, of
      festivals, and of processions, by the permission, or by the
      connivance, of the civil government. About four years after the
      supposed date of this bloody edict, Constantius visited the
      temples of Rome; and the decency of his behavior is recommended
      by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of
      succeeding princes. “That emperor,” says Symmachus, “suffered the
      privileges of the vestal virgins to remain inviolate; he bestowed
      the sacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome, granted the
      customary allowance to defray the expenses of the public rites
      and sacrifices; and, though he had embraced a different religion,
      he never attempted to deprive the empire of the sacred worship of
      antiquity.” 171 The senate still presumed to consecrate, by
      solemn decrees, the _divine_ memory of their sovereigns; and
      Constantine himself was associated, after his death, to those
      gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life. The
      title, the ensigns, the prerogatives, of sovereign pontiff, which
      had been instituted by Numa, and assumed by Augustus, were
      accepted, without hesitation, by seven Christian emperors; who
      were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion
      which they had deserted, than over that which they professed. 172

      a horse, or a slave, or a gold cup; but the devout philosopher

      seldom prospered.]

      The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of _Paganism;_
      173 and the holy war against the infidels was less vigorously
      prosecuted by princes and bishops, who were more immediately
      alarmed by the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion. The
      extirpation of _idolatry_ 174 might have been justified by the
      established principles of intolerance: but the hostile sects,
      which alternately reigned in the Imperial court were mutually
      apprehensive of alienating, and perhaps exasperating, the minds
      of a powerful, though declining faction. Every motive of
      authority and fashion, of interest and reason, now militated on
      the side of Christianity; but two or three generations elapsed,
      before their victorious influence was universally felt. The
      religion which had so long and so lately been established in the
      Roman empire was still revered by a numerous people, less
      attached indeed to speculative opinion, than to ancient custom.
      The honors of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on
      all the subjects of Constantine and Constantius; and a
      considerable portion of knowledge and wealth and valor was still
      engaged in the service of polytheism. The superstition of the
      senator and of the peasant, of the poet and the philosopher, was
      derived from very different causes, but they met with equal
      devotion in the temples of the gods. Their zeal was insensibly
      provoked by the insulting triumph of a proscribed sect; and their
      hopes were revived by the well-grounded confidence, that the
      presumptive heir of the empire, a young and valiant hero, who had
      delivered Gaul from the arms of the Barbarians, had secretly
      embraced the religion of his ancestors.

      those celebrated words. 1. in the Doric dialect, so familiar to
      the Italians, signifies a fountain; and the rural neighborhood,
      which frequented the same fountain, derived the common
      appellation of _pagus_ and _pagans_. (Festus sub voce, and
      Servius ad Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382.) 2. By an easy extension of
      the word, pagan and rural became almost synonymous, (Plin. Hist.
      Natur. xxviii. 5;) and the meaner rustics acquired that name,
      which has been corrupted into _peasants_ in the modern languages
      of Europe. 3. The amazing increase of the military order
      introduced the necessity of a correlative term, (Hume’s Essays,
      vol. i. p. 555;) and all the _people_ who were not enlisted in
      the service of the prince were branded with the contemptuous
      epithets of pagans. (Tacit. Hist. iii. 24, 43, 77. Juvenal.
      Satir. 16. Tertullian de Pallio, c. 4.) 4. The Christians were
      the soldiers of Christ; their adversaries, who refused his
      _sacrament_, or military oath of baptism might deserve the
      metaphorical name of pagans; and this popular reproach was
      introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian (A. D. 365) into
      Imperial laws (Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18) and
      theological writings. 5. Christianity gradually filled the cities
      of the empire: the old religion, in the time of Prudentius
      (advers. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Orosius, (in Præfat.
      Hist.,) retired and languished in obscure villages; and the word
      _pagans_, with its new signification, reverted to its primitive
      origin. 6. Since the worship of Jupiter and his family has
      expired, the vacant title of pagans has been successively applied
      to all the idolaters and polytheists of the old and new world. 7.
      The Latin Christians bestowed it, without scruple, on their
      mortal enemies, the Mahometans; and the purest _Unitarians_ were
      branded with the unjust reproach of idolatry and paganism. See

      Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.—Part I.

     Julian Is Declared Emperor By The Legions Of Gaul.—His March And
     Success.—The Death Of Constantius.—Civil Administration Of Julian.


      While the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of
      eunuchs and bishops, the praises of Julian were repeated with
      transport in every part of the empire, except in the palace of
      Constantius. The barbarians of Germany had felt, and still
      dreaded, the arms of the young Cæsar; his soldiers were the
      companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the
      blessings of his reign; but the favorites, who had opposed his
      elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly
      considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As
      long as the fame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the
      palace, who were skilled in the language of satire, tried the
      efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with
      success. They easily discovered, that his simplicity was not
      exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of a hairy
      savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the
      dress and person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest
      despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of
      a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the
      art of war amidst the groves of the academy. 1 The voice of
      malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory;
      the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be
      painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himself was
      meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honorable
      reward of his labors. In the letters crowned with laurel, which,
      according to ancient custom, were addressed to the provinces, the
      name of Julian was omitted. “Constantius had made his
      dispositions in person; _he_ had signalized his valor in the
      foremost ranks; _his_ military conduct had secured the victory;
      and the captive king of the barbarians was presented to _him_ on
      the field of battle,” from which he was at that time distant
      about forty days’ journey. 2 So extravagant a fable was
      incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of
      satisfying the pride of the emperor himself. Secretly conscious
      that the applause and favor of the Romans accompanied the rising
      fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind was prepared to receive
      the subtle poison of those artful sycophants, who colored their
      mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and
      candor. 3 Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian, they
      acknowledged, and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior
      talents, and important services. But they darkly insinuated, that
      the virtues of the Cæsar might instantly be converted into the
      most dangerous crimes, if the inconstant multitude should prefer
      their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a
      victorious army should be tempted from his allegiance by the
      hopes of revenge and independent greatness. The personal fears of
      Constantius were interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety
      for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps in his own
      breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear,
      the sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly
      conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.

      guarded his person and dignity; and to employ, in a distant war
      against the Persian monarch, the hardy veterans who had
      vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of
      Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of his winter
      quarters at Paris in the administration of power, which, in his
      hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty
      arrival of a tribune and a notary, with positive orders, from the
      emperor, which _they_ were directed to execute, and _he_ was
      commanded not to oppose. Constantius signified his pleasure, that
      four entire legions, the Celtæ, and Petulants, the Heruli, and
      the Batavians, should be separated from the standard of Julian,
      under which they had acquired their fame and discipline; that in
      each of the remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths
      should be selected; and that this numerous detachment, the
      strength of the Gallic army, should instantly begin their march,
      and exert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the opening of
      the campaign, on the frontiers of Persia. 4 The Cæsar foresaw and
      lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate. Most of the
      auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated,
      that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps. The public
      faith of Rome, and the personal honor of Julian, had been pledged
      for the observance of this condition. Such an act of treachery
      and oppression would destroy the confidence, and excite the
      resentment, of the independent warriors of Germany, who
      considered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as
      the most valuable of their possessions. The legionaries, who
      enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for the
      general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard
      with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and
      of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the
      climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they
      despised, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the
      laborious march, the Persian arrows, and the burning deserts of
      Asia. They claimed as their own the country which they had saved;
      and excused their want of spirit, by pleading the sacred and more
      immediate duty of protecting their families and friends.

      The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of
      the impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the provinces
      were exhausted of their military strength, the Germans would
      violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears; and
      notwithstanding the abilities and valor of Julian, the general of
      a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed,
      must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a prisoner in
      the camp of the barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of
      Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had
      received, he subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people
      who deserved his affection. But a positive refusal was an act of
      rebellion, and a declaration of war. The inexorable jealousy of
      the emperor, the peremptory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his
      commands, left not any room for a fair apology, or candid
      interpretation; and the dependent station of the Cæsar scarcely
      allowed him to pause or to deliberate. Solitude increased the
      perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful
      counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office by the
      judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his
      representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would
      have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul. The
      moment had been chosen, when Lupicinus, 5 the general of the
      cavalry, was despatched into Britain, to repulse the inroads of
      the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the
      assessment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt
      statesman, declining to assume a responsible part on this
      dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations
      of Julian, who represented to him, that in every important
      measure, the presence of the præfect was indispensable in the
      council of the prince. In the mean while the Cæsar was oppressed
      by the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial
      messengers, who presumed to suggest, that if he expected the
      return of his ministers, he would charge himself with the guilt
      of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution.
      Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the
      most serious terms, his wish, and even his intention, of
      resigning the purple, which he could not preserve with honor, but
      which he could not abdicate with safety.

      between the _hyeme adultâ_ and the _primo vere_ of Ammianus, (xx.
      l. 4,) instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march of
      three thousand miles, would render the orders of Constantius as
      extravagant as they were unjust. The troops of Gaul could not
      have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of Ammianus
      must have been inaccurate, and his language incorrect. * Note:
      The late editor of Ammianus attempts to vindicate his author from
      the charge of inaccuracy. “It is clear, from the whole course of
      the narrative, that Constantius entertained this design of
      demanding his troops from Julian, immediately after the taking of
      Amida, in the autumn of the preceding year, and had transmitted
      his orders into Gaul, before it was known that Lupicinus had gone
      into Britain with the Herulians and Batavians.” Wagner, note to
      Amm. xx. 4. But it seems also clear that the troops were in
      winter quarters (hiemabant) when the orders arrived. Ammianus can
      scarcely be acquitted of incorrectness in his language at
      least.—M]

      5 (return) [ Ammianus, xx. l. The valor of Lupicinus, and his
      military skill, are acknowledged by the historian, who, in his
      affected language, accuses the general of exalting the horns of
      his pride, bellowing in a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt
      whether he was more cruel or avaricious. The danger from the
      Scots and Picts was so serious that Julian himself had some
      thoughts of passing over into the island.]

      After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled to acknowledge,
      that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and
      that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public
      welfare. He issued the necessary orders for carrying into
      execution the commands of Constantius; a part of the troops began
      their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the several
      garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly. They
      advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted
      crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite their pity by
      silent despair, or loud lamentations, while the wives of the
      soldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accused the
      desertion of their husbands, in the mixed language of grief, of
      tenderness, and of indignation. This scene of general distress
      afflicted the humanity of the Cæsar; he granted a sufficient
      number of post-wagons to transport the wives and families of the
      soldiers, 6 endeavored to alleviate the hardships which he was
      constrained to inflict, and increased, by the most laudable arts,
      his own popularity, and the discontent of the exiled troops. The
      grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage; their
      licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent
      to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for
      the most daring acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their
      tribunes, a seasonable libel was secretly dispersed, which
      painted in lively colors the disgrace of the Cæsar, the
      oppression of the Gallic army, and the feeble vices of the tyrant
      of Asia. The servants of Constantius were astonished and alarmed
      by the progress of this dangerous spirit. They pressed the Cæsar
      to hasten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently
      rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian; who proposed
      that they should not march through Paris, and suggested the
      danger and temptation of a last interview.

      6 (return) [ He granted them the permission of the _cursus
      clavularis_, or _clabularis_. These post-wagons are often
      mentioned in the Code, and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred
      pounds weight. See Vales. ad Ammian. xx. 4.]

      As soon as the approach of the troops was announced, the Cæsar
      went out to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been
      erected in a plain before the gates of the city. After
      distinguishing the officers and soldiers, who by their rank or
      merit deserved a peculiar attention, Julian addressed himself in
      a studied oration to the surrounding multitude: he celebrated
      their exploits with grateful applause; encouraged them to accept,
      with alacrity, the honor of serving under the eye of a powerful
      and liberal monarch; and admonished them, that the commands of
      Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience. The
      soldiers, who were apprehensive of offending their general by an
      indecent clamor, or of belying their sentiments by false and
      venal acclamations, maintained an obstinate silence; and after a
      short pause, were dismissed to their quarters. The principal
      officers were entertained by the Cæsar, who professed, in the
      warmest language of friendship, his desire and his inability to
      reward, according to their deserts, the brave companions of his
      victories. They retired from the feast, full of grief and
      perplexity; and lamented the hardship of their fate, which tore
      them from their beloved general and their native country. The
      only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly
      agitated and approved; the popular resentment was insensibly
      moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of
      complaint were heightened by passion, and their passions were
      inflamed by wine; as, on the eve of their departure, the troops
      were indulged in licentious festivity. At the hour of midnight,
      the impetuous multitude, with swords, and bows, and torches in
      their hands, rushed into the suburbs; encompassed the palace; 7
      and, careless of future dangers, pronounced the fatal and
      irrevocable words, Julian Augustus! The prince, whose anxious
      suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations,
      secured the doors against their intrusion; and as long as it was
      in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents
      of a nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day, the soldiers, whose
      zeal was irritated by opposition, forcibly entered the palace,
      seized, with respectful violence, the object of their choice,
      guarded Julian with drawn swords through the streets of Paris,
      placed him on the tribunal, and with repeated shouts saluted him
      as their emperor. Prudence, as well as loyalty, inculcated the
      propriety of resisting their treasonable designs; and of
      preparing, for his oppressed virtue, the excuse of violence.
      Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals,
      he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed his
      indignation; conjured them not to sully the fame of their
      immortal victories; and ventured to promise, that if they would
      immediately return to their allegiance, he would undertake to
      obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon, but
      even the revocation of the orders which had excited their
      resentment. But the soldiers, who were conscious of their guilt,
      chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian, than on the
      clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was insensibly turned into
      impatience, and their impatience into rage. The inflexible Cæsar
      sustained, till the third hour of the day, their prayers, their
      reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he yield, till he had been
      repeatedly assured, that if he wished to live, he must consent to
      reign. He was exalted on a shield in the presence, and amidst the
      unanimous acclamations, of the troops; a rich military collar,
      which was offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem; 8 the
      ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative; and
      the new emperor, overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired
      into the most secret recesses of his apartment. 10

      palace was reduced, in the twelfth century, to a maze of ruins,
      whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love.

      Parental. c. 44-48, in Fabricius, Bibliot. Græc. tom. vii. p.
      269-273,) Ammianus, (xx. 4,) and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 151, 152,
      153.) who, in the reign of Julian, appears to follow the more
      respectable authority of Eunapius. With such guides we _might_
      neglect the abbreviators and ecclesiastical historians.]

      The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence; out
      his innocence must appear extremely doubtful 11 in the eyes of
      those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions
      of princes. His lively and active mind was susceptible of the
      various impressions of hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge,
      of duty and of ambition, of the love of fame, and of the fear of
      reproach. But it is impossible for us to calculate the respective
      weight and operation of these sentiments; or to ascertain the
      principles of action which might escape the observation, while
      they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian himself. The
      discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his
      enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of
      passion; and if Julian had tried to conceal a deep design under
      the appearances of chance, he must have employed the most
      consummate artifice without necessity, and probably without
      success. He solemnly declares, in the presence of Jupiter, of the
      Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that till
      the close of the evening which preceded his elevation, he was
      utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; 12 and it may
      seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of
      a philosopher. Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius
      was the enemy, and that he himself was the favorite, of the gods,
      might prompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the
      auspicious moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore
      the ancient religion of mankind. When Julian had received the
      intelligence of the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short
      slumber; and afterwards related to his friends that he had seen
      the genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his
      door, pressing for admittance, and reproaching his want of spirit
      and ambition. 13 Astonished and perplexed, he addressed his
      prayers to the great Jupiter, who immediately signified, by a
      clear and manifest omen, that he should submit to the will of
      heaven and of the army. The conduct which disclaims the ordinary
      maxims of reason, excites our suspicion and eludes our inquiry.
      Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at once so credulous and so
      crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it insensibly
      corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.

      credit; of a stately tree thrown to the ground, of a small plant
      striking a deep root into the earth. Even in his sleep, the mind
      of the Cæsar must have been agitated by the hopes and fears of
      his fortune. Zosimus (l. iii. p. 155) relates a subsequent
      dream.]

      To moderate the zeal of his party, to protect the persons of his
      enemies, 14 to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which
      were formed against his life and dignity, were the cares which
      employed the first days of the reign of the new emperor. Although
      he was firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had
      assumed, he was still desirous of saving his country from the
      calamities of civil war, of declining a contest with the superior
      forces of Constantius, and of preserving his own character from
      the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the ensigns
      of military and imperial pomp, Julian showed himself in the field
      of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the
      cause of their pupil, their leader, and their friend. He
      recapitulated their victories, lamented their sufferings,
      applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and checked
      their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till he had
      obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of
      the East would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce
      any views of conquest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil
      possession of the Gallic provinces. On this foundation he
      composed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a specious
      and moderate epistle, 15 which was delivered to Pentadius, his
      master of the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius; two
      ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer, and observe
      the dispositions of Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with
      the modest appellation of Cæsar; but Julian solicits in a
      peremptory, though respectful, manner, the confirmation of the
      title of Augustus. He acknowledges the irregularity of his own
      election, while he justifies, in some measure, the resentment and
      violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent.
      He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius; and engages
      to send him an annual present of Spanish horses, to recruit his
      army with a select number of barbarian youths, and to accept from
      his choice a Prætorian præfect of approved discretion and
      fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other
      civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and
      the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes
      the emperor to consult the dictates of justice; to distrust the
      arts of those venal flatterers, who subsist only by the discord
      of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honorable
      treaty, equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of
      Constantine. In this negotiation Julian claimed no more than he
      already possessed. The delegated authority which he had long
      exercised over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was
      still obeyed under a name more independent and august. The
      soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not
      stained even with the blood of the guilty. Florentius was a
      fugitive; Lupicinus a prisoner. The persons who were disaffected
      to the new government were disarmed and secured; and the vacant
      offices were distributed, according to the recommendation of
      merit, by a prince who despised the intrigues of the palace, and
      the clamors of the soldiers. 16

      The negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the
      most vigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held
      in readiness for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by
      the disorders of the times. The cruel persecutions of the faction
      of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and
      robbers. They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon
      from a prince whom they could trust, submitted to the restraints
      of military discipline, and retained only their implacable hatred
      to the person and government of Constantius. 17 As soon as the
      season of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he
      appeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the
      Rhine in the neighborhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the
      perfidy of the Attuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that
      they might ravage, with impunity, the frontiers of a divided
      empire. The difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprise,
      consisted in a laborious march; and Julian had conquered, as soon
      as he could penetrate into a country, which former princes had
      considered as inaccessible. After he had given peace to the
      Barbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications
      along the Qhine from Cleves to Basil; surveyed, with peculiar
      attention, the territories which he had recovered from the hands
      of the Alemanni, passed through Besançon, 18 which had severely
      suffered from their fury, and fixed his headquarters at Vienna
      for the ensuing winter. The barrier of Gaul was improved and
      strengthened with additional fortifications; and Julian
      entertained some hopes that the Germans, whom he had so often
      vanquished, might, in his absence, be restrained by the terror of
      his name. Vadomair 19 was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he
      esteemed or feared and while the subtle Barbarian affected to
      observe the faith of treaties, the progress of his arms
      threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war. The
      policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the
      Alemanni by his own arts: and Vadomair, who, in the character of
      a friend, had incautiously accepted an invitation from the Roman
      governors, was seized in the midst of the entertainment, and sent
      away prisoner into the heart of Spain. Before the Barbarians were
      recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on
      the banks of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river,
      renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been
      already made by four preceding expeditions. 20

      Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.—Part II.


      The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed to execute, with
      the utmost diligence, their important commission. But, in their
      passage through Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the
      tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors; they
      were conducted by slow journeys from Constantinople to Cæsarea in
      Cappadocia; and when at length they were admitted to the presence
      of Constantius, they found that he had already conceived, from
      the despatches of his own officers, the most unfavorable opinion
      of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic army. The letters
      were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers were
      dismissed with indignation and contempt; and the looks, gestures,
      the furious language of the monarch, expressed the disorder of
      his soul. The domestic connection, which might have reconciled
      the brother and the husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by
      the death of that princess, whose pregnancy had been several
      times fruitless, and was at last fatal to herself. 21 The empress
      Eusebia had preserved, to the last moment of her life, the warm,
      and even jealous, affection which she had conceived for Julian;
      and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a
      prince, who, since her death, was abandoned to his own passions,
      and to the arts of his eunuchs. But the terror of a foreign
      invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private
      enemy: he continued his march towards the confines of Persia, and
      thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might
      entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their
      offended sovereign. He required, that the presumptuous Cæsar
      should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus,
      which he had accepted from the rebels; that he should descend to
      his former station of a limited and dependent minister; that he
      should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of
      those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court; and that
      he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which
      were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic bishop, and one of the
      Arian favorites of Constantius. Several months were ineffectually
      consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the distance of
      three thousand miles between Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as
      Julian perceived that his modest and respectful behavior served
      only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly
      resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil
      war. He gave a public and military audience to the quæstor
      Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the
      attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most
      flattering deference, that he was ready to resign the title of
      Augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those whom he
      acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The faint proposal
      was impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of “Julian
      Augustus, continue to reign, by the authority of the army, of the
      people, of the republic which you have saved,” thundered at once
      from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador
      of Constantius. A part of the letter was afterwards read, in
      which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he
      had invested with the honors of the purple; whom he had educated
      with so much care and tenderness; whom he had preserved in his
      infancy, when he was left a helpless orphan.

      “An orphan!” interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by
      indulging his passions: “does the assassin of my family reproach
      me that I was left an orphan? He urges me to revenge those
      injuries which I have long studied to forget.” The assembly was
      dismissed; and Leonas, who, with some difficulty, had been
      protected from the popular fury, was sent back to his master with
      an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of the most
      vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of
      resentment, which had been suppressed and imbittered by the
      dissimulation of twenty years. After this message, which might be
      considered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some
      weeks before, had celebrated the Christian festival of the
      Epiphany, 22 made a public declaration that he committed the care
      of his safety to the Immortal Gods; and thus publicly renounced
      the religion as well as the friendship of Constantius. 23

      22,) who, on this occasion, appears to have possessed and used
      some valuable materials.]

      The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate
      resolution. He had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his
      adversary, sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the
      monarch, had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces
      of the West. The position of two magazines, one of them collected
      on the banks of the Lake of Constance, the other formed at the
      foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to indicate the march of two
      armies; and the size of those magazines, each of which consisted
      of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, 24
      was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the
      enemy who prepared to surround him. But the Imperial legions were
      still in their distant quarters of Asia; the Danube was feebly
      guarded; and if Julian could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the
      important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people
      of soldiers would resort to his standard, and that the rich mines
      of gold and silver would contribute to the expenses of the civil
      war. He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the
      soldiers; inspired them with a just confidence in their general,
      and in themselves; and exhorted them to maintain their reputation
      of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their
      fellow-citizens, and obedient to their officers. His spirited
      discourse was received with the loudest acclamations, and the
      same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius, when he
      summoned them to leave Gaul, now declared with alacrity, that
      they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or
      Asia. The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers,
      clashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their
      throats, devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the
      service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul
      and the conqueror of the Germans. 25 This solemn engagement,
      which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty, was
      singly opposed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office
      of Prætorian præfect. That faithful minister, alone and
      unassisted, asserted the rights of Constantius, in the midst of
      an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury he had almost fallen
      an honorable, but useless sacrifice. After losing one of his
      hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the
      prince whom he had offended. Julian covered the præfect with his
      Imperial mantle, and, protecting him from the zeal of his
      followers, dismissed him to his own house, with less respect than
      was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy. 26 The high office of
      Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul,
      which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of
      taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the
      friend of Julian, who was permitted to practise those virtues
      which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil. 27

      advantages of an offensive war, (ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 286,
      287.)]

      25 (return) [ See his oration, and the behavior of the troops, in

      præfect, whom he sent into Tuscany. (Ammian. xxi. 5.) Libanius,
      with savage fury, insults Nebridius, applauds the soldiers, and
      almost censures the humanity of Julian. (Orat. Parent. c. 53, p.
      278.)]

      27 (return) [ Ammian. xxi. 8. In this promotion, Julian obeyed

      suffragante, ad potiorem veniat gradum. (Ammian. xx. 5.) Absence
      did not weaken his regard for Sallust, with whose name (A. D.
      363) he honored the consulship.]

      The hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his
      troops, than on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of
      a daring enterprise, he availed himself of every precaution, as
      far as prudence could suggest; and where prudence could no longer
      accompany his steps, he trusted the event to valor and to
      fortune. In the neighborhood of Basil he assembled and divided
      his army. 28 One body, which consisted of ten thousand men, was
      directed under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to
      advance through the midland parts of Rhætia and Noricum. A
      similar division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and
      Jovinus, prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways,
      through the Alps, and the northern confines of Italy. The
      instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and
      precision: to hasten their march in close and compact columns,
      which, according to the disposition of the ground, might readily
      be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves against
      the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards;
      to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude
      examination by their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of
      their strength, and the terror of his name; and to join their
      sovereign under the walls of Sirmium. For himself Julian had
      reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part. He selected
      three thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like their
      leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat; at the head
      of this faithful band, he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of
      the Marcian, or Black Forest, which conceals the sources of the
      Danube; 29 and, for many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to
      the world. The secrecy of his march, his diligence, and vigor,
      surmounted every obstacle; he forced his way over mountains and
      morasses, occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pursued his
      direct course, 30 without reflecting whether he traversed the
      territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians, and at length
      emerged, between Ratisbon and Vienna, at the place where he
      designed to embark his troops on the Danube. By a well-concerted
      stratagem, he seized a fleet of light brigantines, 31 as it lay
      at anchor; secured a apply of coarse provisions sufficient to
      satisfy the indelicate, and voracious, appetite of a Gallic army;
      and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube. The
      labors of the mariners, who plied their oars with incessant
      diligence, and the steady continuance of a favorable wind,
      carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days; 32
      and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia, 3211 only
      nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any
      certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine. In
      the course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian
      was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted
      the deputations of some cities, which hastened to claim the merit
      of an early submission, he passed before the hostile stations,
      which were placed along the river, without indulging the
      temptation of signalizing a useless and ill-timed valor. The
      banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators,
      who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the
      event, and diffused through the adjacent country the fame of a
      young hero, who advanced with more than mortal speed at the head
      of the innumerable forces of the West. Lucilian, who, with the
      rank of general of the cavalry, commanded the military powers of
      Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports,
      which he could neither reject nor believe. He had taken some slow
      and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops,
      when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom
      Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forwards with
      some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life
      or death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the
      presence of Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and
      dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupefy his
      faculties. But Lucilian had no sooner recovered his spirits, than
      he betrayed his want of discretion, by presuming to admonish his
      conqueror that he had rashly ventured, with a handful of men, to
      expose his person in the midst of his enemies. “Reserve for your
      master Constantius these timid remonstrances,” replied Julian,
      with a smile of contempt: “when I gave you my purple to kiss, I
      received you not as a counsellor, but as a suppliant.” Conscious
      that success alone could justify his attempt, and that boldness
      only could command success, he instantly advanced, at the head of
      three thousand soldiers, to attack the strongest and most
      populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he entered the long
      suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful acclamations of
      the army and people; who, crowned with flowers, and holding
      lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged
      sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were devoted to the
      public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the circus; but,
      early on the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy
      the narrow pass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Hæmus; which,
      almost in the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople,
      separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia, by an abrupt descent
      towards the former, and a gentle declivity on the side of the
      latter. 33 The defence of this important post was intrusted to
      the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of the Italian
      division, successfully executed the plan of the march and
      junction which their master had so ably conceived. 34

      The homage which Julian obtained, from the fears or the
      inclination of the people, extended far beyond the immediate
      effect of his arms. 35 The præfectures of Italy and Illyricum
      were administered by Taurus and Florentius, who united that
      important office with the vain honors of the consulship; and as
      those magistrates had retired with precipitation to the court of
      Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of his
      temper, stigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of
      the Year, the epithet of _fugitive_ to the names of the two
      consuls. The provinces which had been deserted by their first
      magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor, who,
      conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a
      philosopher, was equally admired in the camps of the Danube and
      in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or, more properly, from
      his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he distributed to the
      principal cities of the empire, a labored apology for his own
      conduct; published the secret despatches of Constantius; and
      solicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors, the
      one of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the
      Barbarians. 36 Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the
      reproach of ingratitude, aspired to maintain, by argument as well
      as by arms, the superior merits of his cause; and to excel, not
      only in the arts of war, but in those of composition. His epistle
      to the senate and people of Athens 37 seems to have been dictated
      by an elegant enthusiasm; which prompted him to submit his
      actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his own
      times, with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading,
      in the days of Aristides, before the tribunal of the Areopagus.
      His application to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted
      to bestow the titles of Imperial power, was agreeable to the
      forms of the expiring republic. An assembly was summoned by
      Tertullus, præfect of the city; the epistle of Julian was read;
      and, as he appeared to be master of Italy his claims were
      admitted without a dissenting voice. His oblique censure of the
      innovations of Constantine, and his passionate invective against
      the vices of Constantius, were heard with less satisfaction; and
      the senate, as if Julian had been present, unanimously exclaimed,
      “Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own fortune.” 38 An
      artful expression, which, according to the chance of war, might
      be differently explained; as a manly reproof of the ingratitude
      of the usurper, or as a flattering confession, that a single act
      of such benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings
      of Constantius.

      The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was
      speedily transmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor,
      had obtained some respite from the Persian war. Disguising the
      anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt, Constantius
      professed his intention of returning into Europe, and of giving
      chase to Julian; for he never spoke of his military expedition in
      any other light than that of a hunting party. 39 In the camp of
      Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this design to his army;
      slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Cæsar; and
      ventured to assure them, that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed
      to meet them in the field, they would be unable to sustain the
      fire of their eyes, and the irresistible weight of their shout of
      onset. The speech of the emperor was received with military
      applause, and Theodotus, the president of the council of
      Hierapolis, requested, with tears of adulation, that _his_ city
      might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel. 40 A
      chosen detachment was despatched away in post-wagons, to secure,
      if it were yet possible, the pass of Succi; the recruits, the
      horses, the arms, and the magazines, which had been prepared
      against Sapor, were appropriated to the service of the civil war;
      and the domestic victories of Constantius inspired his partisans
      with the most sanguine assurances of success. The notary
      Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the
      subsistence of Rome was intercepted; and the distress of Julian
      was increased by an unexpected event, which might have been
      productive of fatal consequences. Julian had received the
      submission of two legions and a cohort of archers, who were
      stationed at Sirmium; but he suspected, with reason, the fidelity
      of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor; and
      it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed state
      of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from the most important
      scene of action. They advanced, with reluctance, as far as the
      confines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and
      the savage fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the
      instigation of one of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to
      erect the banners of Constantius on the walls of that impregnable
      city. The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the extent of the
      mischief, and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy. By
      his order, Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy; and
      the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence, and prosecuted
      with vigor. But the legionaries, who seemed to have rejected the
      yoke of discipline, conducted the defence of the place with skill
      and perseverance; vited the rest of Italy to imitate the example
      of their courage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of
      Julian, if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers
      of the armies of the East. 41

      dubio fore victorem; nemo enim omnium tunc ab hac constanti
      sententia discrepebat. Ammian. xxi. 7.]

      But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel
      alternative which he pathetically laments, of destroying or of
      being himself destroyed: and the seasonable death of Constantius
      delivered the Roman empire from the calamities of civil war. The
      approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch; and
      his favorites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge. A
      slight fever, which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of
      his spirits, was increased by the fatigues of the journey; and
      Constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene,
      twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired, after a short
      illness, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the
      twenty-fourth of his reign. 42 His genuine character, which was
      composed of pride and weakness, of superstition and cruelty, has
      been fully displayed in the preceding narrative of civil and
      ecclesiastical events. The long abuse of power rendered him a
      considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries; but as
      personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity, the
      last of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world,
      with the remark, that he inherited the defects, without the
      abilities, of his father. Before Constantius expired, he is said
      to have named Julian for his successor; nor does it seem
      improbable, that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and
      tender wife, whom he left with child, may have prevailed, in his
      last moments, over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge.
      Eusebius, and his guilty associates, made a faint attempt to
      prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the election of another
      emperor; but their intrigues were rejected with disdain, by an
      army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord; and two
      officers of rank were instantly despatched, to assure Julian,
      that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service.
      The military designs of that prince, who had formed three
      different attacks against Thrace, were prevented by this
      fortunate event. Without shedding the blood of his
      fellow-citizens, he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict,
      and acquired the advantages of a complete victory. Impatient to
      visit the place of his birth, and the new capital of the empire,
      he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of Hæmus, and the
      cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the distance of
      sixty miles, all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him;
      and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations
      of the soldiers, the people, and the senate. An innumerable
      multitude pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps
      disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb
      of a hero, whose unexperienced youth had vanquished the
      Barbarians of Germany, and who had now traversed, in a successful
      career, the whole continent of Europe, from the shores of the
      Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus. 43 A few days afterwards,
      when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the
      harbor, the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected
      humanity of their sovereign. On foot, without his diadem, and
      clothed in a mourning habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as
      the church of the Holy Apostles, where the body was deposited:
      and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish
      tribute to the birth and dignity of his Imperial kinsman, the
      tears of Julian professed to the world that he had forgot the
      injuries, and remembered only the obligations, which he had
      received from Constantius. 44 As soon as the legions of Aquileia
      were assured of the death of the emperor, they opened the gates
      of the city, and, by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders,
      obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian;
      who, in the thirty-second year of his age, acquired the
      undisputed possession of the Roman empire. 45

      Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.—Part III.


      Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of
      action and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the
      accidents of his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice.
      He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the
      academy, and the society of Athens; but he was constrained, at
      first by the will, and afterwards by the injustice, of
      Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the dangers of
      Imperial greatness; and to make himself accountable to the world,
      and to posterity, for the happiness of millions. 46 Julian
      recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato, 47
      that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed
      to beings of a superior species; and that the conduct of nations
      requires and deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the
      genii. From this principle he justly concluded, that the man who
      presumes to reign, should aspire to the perfection of the divine
      nature; that he should purify his soul from her mortal and
      terrestrial part; that he should extinguish his appetites,
      enlighten his understanding, regulate his passions, and subdue
      the wild beast, which, according to the lively metaphor of
      Aristotle, 48 seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot. The
      throne of Julian, which the death of Constantius fixed on an
      independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps
      of vanity. He despised the honors, renounced the pleasures, and
      discharged with incessant diligence the duties, of his exalted
      station; and there were few among his subjects who would have
      consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had they
      been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the
      rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor imposed on himself.
      One of his most intimate friends, 49 who had often shared the
      frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light and
      sparing diet (which was usually of the vegetable kind) left his
      mind and body always free and active, for the various and
      important business of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a
      general, and a prince. In one and the same day, he gave audience
      to several ambassadors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of
      letters to his generals, his civil magistrates, his private
      friends, and the different cities of his dominions. He listened
      to the memorials which had been received, considered the subject
      of the petitions, and signified his intentions more rapidly than
      they could be taken in short-hand by the diligence of his
      secretaries. He possessed such flexibility of thought, and such
      firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write,
      his ear to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once
      three several trains of ideas without hesitation, and without
      error. While his ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility
      from one labor to another, and, after a hasty dinner, retired
      into his library, till the public business, which he had
      appointed for the evening, summoned him to interrupt the
      prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was still
      less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never
      clouded by the fumes of indigestion; and except in the short
      interval of a marriage, which was the effect of policy rather
      than love, the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female
      companion. 50 He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh
      secretaries, who had slept the preceding day; and his servants
      were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master
      allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of
      occupation. The predecessors of Julian, his uncle, his brother,
      and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for the games of the
      Circus, under the specious pretence of complying with the
      inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained the
      greatest part of the day as idle spectators, and as a part of the
      splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races
      51 was completely finished. On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt
      and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous
      amusements, condescended to appear in the Circus; and after
      bestowing a careless glance at five or six of the races, he
      hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher, who
      considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the
      advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind. 52 By
      this avarice of time, he seemed to protract the short duration of
      his reign; and if the dates were less securely ascertained, we
      should refuse to believe, that only sixteen months elapsed
      between the death of Constantius and the departure of his
      successor for the Persian war. The actions of Julian can only be
      preserved by the care of the historian; but the portion of his
      voluminous writings, which is still extant, remains as a monument
      of the application, as well as of the genius, of the emperor. The
      Misopogon, the Cæsars, several of his orations, and his elaborate
      work against the Christian religion, were composed in the long
      nights of the two winters, the former of which he passed at
      Constantinople, and the latter at Antioch.

      of his wife, (Orat. Parent. c. lxxxviii. p. 313.) The chastity of
      Julian is confirmed by the impartial testimony of Ammianus, (xxv.
      4,) and the partial silence of the Christians. Yet Julian
      ironically urges the reproach of the people of Antioch, that he
      _almost always_ (in Misopogon, p. 345) lay alone. This suspicious
      expression is explained by the Abbé de la Bleterie (Hist. de
      Jovien, tom. ii. p. 103-109) with candor and ingenuity.]

      The reformation of the Imperial court was one of the first and
      most necessary acts of the government of Julian. 53 Soon after
      his entrance into the palace of Constantinople, he had occasion
      for the service of a barber. An officer, magnificently dressed,
      immediately presented himself. “It is a barber,” exclaimed the
      prince, with affected surprise, “that I want, and not a
      receiver-general of the finances.” 54 He questioned the man
      concerning the profits of his employment and was informed, that
      besides a large salary, and some valuable perquisites, he enjoyed
      a daily allowance for twenty servants, and as many horses. A
      thousand barbers, a thousand cup-bearers, a thousand cooks, were
      distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of
      eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer’s
      day. The monarch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of
      merit and virtue, was distinguished by the oppressive
      magnificence of his dress, his table, his buildings, and his
      train. The stately palaces erected by Constantine and his sons,
      were decorated with many colored marbles, and ornaments of massy
      gold. The most exquisite dainties were procured, to gratify their
      pride, rather than their taste; birds of the most distant
      climates, fish from the most remote seas, fruits out of their
      natural season, winter roses, and summer snows. 56 The domestic
      crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions; yet the
      smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the
      use, or even to the splendor, of the throne. The monarch was
      disgraced, and the people was injured, by the creation and sale
      of an infinite number of obscure, and even titular employments;
      and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of
      being maintained, without the necessity of labor, from the public
      revenue. The waste of an enormous household, the increase of fees
      and perquisites, which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and
      the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their
      enmity, or solicited their favor, suddenly enriched these haughty
      menials. They abused their fortune, without considering their
      past, or their future, condition; and their rapine and venality
      could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations.
      Their silken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables were
      served with delicacy and profusion; the houses which they built
      for their own use, would have covered the farm of an ancient
      consul; and the most honorable citizens were obliged to dismount
      from their horses, and respectfully to salute a eunuch whom they
      met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the
      contempt and indignation of Julian, who usually slept on the
      ground, who yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of
      nature; and who placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in
      despising, the pomp of royalty.

      Ammianus, (xxii. 4,) Libanius, Orat. (Parent. c. lxii. p. 288,

      forcible. Quis etiam prandiorum et cænarum laboratas magnitudines

      pisces, aheni temporis poma, æstivæ nives, hybernæ rosæ]

      By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even
      beyond its real extent, he was impatient to relieve the distress,
      and to appease the murmurs of the people; who support with less
      uneasiness the weight of taxes, if they are convinced that the
      fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the
      state. But in the execution of this salutary work, Julian is
      accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderate
      severity. By a single edict, he reduced the palace of
      Constantinople to an immense desert, and dismissed with ignominy
      the whole train of slaves and dependants, 57 without providing
      any just, or at least benevolent, exceptions, for the age, the
      services, or the poverty, of the faithful domestics of the
      Imperial family. Such indeed was the temper of Julian, who seldom
      recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle, that true virtue
      is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices.

      The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and
      paint, the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so
      ridiculous in the person of Constantine, were consistently
      rejected by his philosophic successor. But with the fopperies,
      Julian affected to renounce the decencies of dress; and seemed to
      value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness. In a
      satirical performance, which was designed for the public eye, the
      emperor descants with pleasure, and even with pride, on the
      length of his nails, and the inky blackness of his hands;
      protests, that although the greatest part of his body was covered
      with hair, the use of the razor was confined to his head alone;
      and celebrates, with visible complacency, the shaggy and
      _populous_ 58 beard, which he fondly cherished, after the example
      of the philosophers of Greece. Had Julian consulted the simple
      dictates of reason, the first magistrate of the Romans would have

      fact, which seems indeed to belong more properly to Constantius.

      strangely characteristic. The friends of the Abbé de la Bleterie
      adjured him, in the name of the French nation, not to translate
      this passage, so offensive to their delicacy, (Hist. de Jovien,
      tom. ii. p. 94.) Like him, I have contented myself with a
      transient allusion; but the little animal which Julian _names_,
      is a beast familiar to man, and signifies love.]

      But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect,
      if Julian had only corrected the abuses, without punishing the
      crimes, of his predecessor’s reign. “We are now delivered,” says
      he, in a familiar letter to one of his intimate friends, “we are
      now surprisingly delivered from the voracious jaws of the Hydra.
      59 I do not mean to apply the epithet to my brother Constantius.
      He is no more; may the earth lie light on his head! But his
      artful and cruel favorites studied to deceive and exasperate a
      prince, whose natural mildness cannot be praised without some
      efforts of adulation. It is not, however, my intention, that even
      those men should be oppressed: they are accused, and they shall
      enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial.” To conduct this
      inquiry, Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state
      and army; and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning
      his personal enemies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at
      Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; and transferred
      to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute
      their final sentence, without delay, and without appeal. The
      office of president was exercised by the venerable præfect of the
      East, a _second_ Sallust, 60 whose virtues conciliated the esteem
      of Greek sophists, and of Christian bishops. He was assisted by
      the eloquent Mamertinus, 61 one of the consuls elect, whose merit
      is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own
      applause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was
      overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals, Nevitta,
      Agilo, Jovinus, and Arbetio. Arbetio, whom the public would have
      seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench, was
      supposed to possess the secret of the commission; the armed and
      angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands encompassed the
      tribunal; and the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of
      justice, and by the clamors of faction. 62

      _Secundus_, as a convenient epithet. The second Sallust extorted

      The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favor of
      Constantius, expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence,
      the corruption, and cruelty of his servile reign. The executions
      of Paul and Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive) were
      accepted as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of
      so many hundred Romans, whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and
      murdered. But justice herself (if we may use the pathetic
      expression of Ammianus) 63 appeared to weep over the fate of
      Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire; and his blood accused the
      ingratitude of Julian, whose distress had been seasonably
      relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister. The
      rage of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indiscretion,
      was the cause and the excuse of his death; and the emperor,
      deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public,
      offered some consolation to the family of Ursulus, by the
      restitution of his confiscated fortunes. Before the end of the
      year in which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the
      prefecture and consulship, 64 Taurus and Florentius were reduced
      to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon.
      The former was banished to Vercellæ in Italy, and a sentence of
      death was pronounced against the latter. A wise prince should
      have rewarded the crime of Taurus: the faithful minister, when he
      was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel, had taken
      refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign.
      But the guilt of Florentius justified the severity of the judges;
      and his escape served to display the magnanimity of Julian, who
      nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer, and
      refused to learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from
      his just resentment. 65 Some months after the tribunal of
      Chalcedon had been dissolved, the prætorian vicegerent of Africa,
      the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius 66 duke of Egypt, were
      executed at Antioch. Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt
      tyrant of a great province; Gaudentius had long practised the
      arts of calumny against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the
      person of Julian himself. Yet the circumstances of their trial
      and condemnation were so unskillfully managed, that these wicked
      men obtained, in the public opinion, the glory of suffering for
      the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of
      Constantius. The rest of his servants were protected by a general
      act of oblivion; and they were left to enjoy with impunity the
      bribes which they had accepted, either to defend the oppressed,
      or to oppress the friendless. This measure, which, on the
      soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was
      executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the
      throne. Julian was tormented by the importunities of a multitude,
      particularly of Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which
      they had imprudently or illegally bestowed; he foresaw the
      endless prosecution of vexatious suits; and he engaged a promise,
      which ought always to have been sacred, that if they would repair
      to Chalcedon, he would meet them in person, to hear and determine
      their complaints. But as soon as they were landed, he issued an
      absolute order, which prohibited the watermen from transporting
      any Egyptian to Constantinople; and thus detained his
      disappointed clients on the Asiatic shore till, their patience
      and money being utterly exhausted, they were obliged to return
      with indignant murmurs to their native country. 67

      Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.—Part IV.


      The numerous army of spies, of agents, and informers enlisted by
      Constantius to secure the repose of one man, and to interrupt
      that of millions, was immediately disbanded by his generous
      successor. Julian was slow in his suspicions, and gentle in his
      punishments; and his contempt of treason was the result of
      judgment, of vanity, and of courage. Conscious of superior merit,
      he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet
      him in the field, to attempt his life, or even to seat themselves
      on his vacant throne. The philosopher could excuse the hasty
      sallies of discontent; and the hero could despise the ambitious
      projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash
      conspirators. A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a
      purple garment; and this indiscreet action, which, under the
      reign of Constantius, would have been considered as a capital
      offence, 68 was reported to Julian by the officious importunity
      of a private enemy. The monarch, after making some inquiry into
      the rank and character of his rival, despatched the informer with
      a present of a pair of purple slippers, to complete the
      magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more dangerous conspiracy
      was formed by ten of the domestic guards, who had resolved to
      assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch. Their
      intemperance revealed their guilt; and they were conducted in
      chains to the presence of their injured sovereign, who, after a
      lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their
      enterprise, instead of a death of torture, which they deserved
      and expected, pronounced a sentence of exile against the two
      principal offenders. The only instance in which Julian seemed to
      depart from his accustomed clemency, was the execution of a rash
      youth, who, with a feeble hand, had aspired to seize the reins of
      empire. But that youth was the son of Marcellus, the general of
      cavalry, who, in the first campaign of the Gallic war, had
      deserted the standard of the Cæsar and the republic. Without
      appearing to indulge his personal resentment, Julian might easily
      confound the crime of the son and of the father; but he was
      reconciled by the distress of Marcellus, and the liberality of
      the emperor endeavored to heal the wound which had been inflicted
      by the hand of justice. 69

      that actions the most indifferent in our eyes might excite, in a
      Roman mind, the idea of guilt and danger. This strange apology is
      supported by a strange misapprehension of the English laws, “chez
      une nation.... où il est défendu de boire à la santé d’une
      certaine personne.”]

      69 (return) [ The clemency of Julian, and the conspiracy which
      was formed against his life at Antioch, are described by Ammianus
      (xxii. 9, 10, and Vales, ad loc.) and Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c.
      99, p. 323.)]

      Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom. 70 From
      his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and
      heroes; his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a
      tyrant; and when he ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes
      mortified by the reflection, that the slaves who would not dare
      to censure his defects were not worthy to applaud his virtues. 71
      He sincerely abhorred the system of Oriental despotism, which
      Diocletian, Constantine, and the patient habits of fourscore
      years, had established in the empire. A motive of superstition
      prevented the execution of the design, which Julian had
      frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the weight of a
      costly diadem; 72 but he absolutely refused the title of
      _Dominus_, or _Lord_, 73 a word which was grown so familiar to
      the ears of the Romans, that they no longer remembered its
      servile and humiliating origin. The office, or rather the name,
      of consul, was cherished by a prince who contemplated with
      reverence the ruins of the republic; and the same behavior which
      had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by
      Julian from choice and inclination. On the calends of January, at
      break of day, the new consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta, hastened
      to the palace to salute the emperor. As soon as he was informed
      of their approach, he leaped from his throne, eagerly advanced to
      meet them, and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the
      demonstrations of his affected humility. From the palace they
      proceeded to the senate. The emperor, on foot, marched before
      their litters; and the gazing multitude admired the image of
      ancient times, or secretly blamed a conduct, which, in their
      eyes, degraded the majesty of the purple. 74 But the behavior of
      Julian was uniformly supported. During the games of the Circus,
      he had, imprudently or designedly, performed the manumission of a
      slave in the presence of the consul. The moment he was reminded
      that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of _another_
      magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of
      gold; and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the
      world, that he was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens,
      to the laws, 75 and even to the forms, of the republic. The
      spirit of his administration, and his regard for the place of his
      nativity, induced Julian to confer on the senate of
      Constantinople the same honors, privileges, and authority, which
      were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome. 76 A legal
      fiction was introduced, and gradually established, that one half
      of the national council had migrated into the East; and the
      despotic successors of Julian, accepting the title of Senators,
      acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body, which
      was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name. From
      Constantinople, the attention of the monarch was extended to the
      municipal senates of the provinces. He abolished, by repeated
      edicts, the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn
      so many idle citizens from the services of their country; and by
      imposing an equal distribution of public duties, he restored the
      strength, the splendor, or, according to the glowing expression
      of Libanius, 77 the soul of the expiring cities of his empire.
      The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender compassion in
      the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture when he
      recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes
      and to gods, who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the
      monuments of their genius, or the example of their virtues. He
      relieved the distress, and restored the beauty, of the cities of
      Epirus and Peloponnesus. 78 Athens acknowledged him for her
      benefactor; Argos, for her deliverer. The pride of Corinth, again
      rising from her ruins with the honors of a Roman colony, exacted
      a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the purpose of
      defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated in the
      amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers. From this
      tribute the cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had
      inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of
      perpetuating the Olympic, the Pythian, and the Nemean games,
      claimed a just exemption. The immunity of Elis and Delphi was
      respected by the Corinthians; but the poverty of Argos tempted
      the insolence of oppression; and the feeble complaints of its
      deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate,
      who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in
      which he resided. Seven years after this sentence, Julian 79
      allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal; and his
      eloquence was interposed, most probably with success, in the
      defence of a city, which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon, 80
      and had given to Macedonia a race of kings and conquerors. 81

      of the court. The Abbé de la Bleterie (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii.

      and unpopular in Greece. When the Achæan league declared against
      Philip, it was thought decent that the deputies of Argos should
      retire, (T. Liv. xxxii. 22.)]

      The laborious administration of military and civil affairs, which
      were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire,
      exercised the abilities of Julian; but he frequently assumed the
      two characters of Orator 82 and of Judge, 83 which are almost
      unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe. The arts of
      persuasion, so diligently cultivated by the first Cæsars, were
      neglected by the military ignorance and Asiatic pride of their
      successors; and if they condescended to harangue the soldiers,
      whom they feared, they treated with silent disdain the senators,
      whom they despised. The assemblies of the senate, which
      Constantius had avoided, were considered by Julian as the place
      where he could exhibit, with the most propriety, the maxims of a
      republican, and the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately
      practised, as in a school of declamation, the several modes of
      praise, of censure, of exhortation; and his friend Libanius has
      remarked, that the study of Homer taught him to imitate the
      simple, concise style of Menelaus, the copiousness of Nestor,
      whose words descended like the flakes of a winter’s snow, or the
      pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. The functions of a
      judge, which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince,
      were exercised by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an
      amusement; and although he might have trusted the integrity and
      discernment of his Prætorian præfects, he often placed himself by
      their side on the seat of judgment. The acute penetration of his
      mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the
      chicanery of the advocates, who labored to disguise the truths of
      facts, and to pervert the sense of the laws. He sometimes forgot
      the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or unseasonable
      questions, and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice, and the
      agitation of his body, the earnest vehemence with which he
      maintained his opinion against the judges, the advocates, and
      their clients. But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him
      to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends and
      ministers; and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular
      sallies of his passions, the spectators could observe the shame,
      as well as the gratitude, of their monarch. The decrees of Julian
      were almost always founded on the principles of justice; and he
      had the firmness to resist the two most dangerous temptations,
      which assault the tribunal of a sovereign, under the specious
      forms of compassion and equity. He decided the merits of the
      cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the
      poor, whom he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the
      just demands of a wealthy and noble adversary. He carefully
      distinguished the judge from the legislator; 84 and though he
      meditated a necessary reformation of the Roman jurisprudence, he
      pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal
      interpretation of those laws, which the magistrates were bound to
      execute, and the subjects to obey.

      that Julian was the only prince, since Julius Cæsar, who
      harangued the senate. All the predecessors of Nero, (Tacit.
      Annal. xiii. 3,) and many of his successors, possessed the
      faculty of speaking in public; and it might be proved by various
      examples, that they frequently exercised it in the senate.]

      his picture, if it flatters the person, expresses at least the
      duties, of the judge. Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 120,) who
      suppresses the virtues, and exaggerates even the venial faults of
      the Apostate, triumphantly asks, whether such a judge was fit to
      be seated between Minos and Rhadamanthus, in the Elysian Fields.]

      84 (return) [ Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of
      sixteen months, fifty-four have been admitted into the codes of
      Theodosius and Justinian. (Gothofred. Chron. Legum, p. 64-67.)
      The Abbé de la Bleterie (tom. ii. p. 329-336) has chosen one of
      these laws to give an idea of Julian’s Latin style, which is
      forcible and elaborate, but less pure than his Greek.]

      The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple,
      and cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the
      lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their
      obscurity. But the personal merit of Julian was, in some measure,
      independent of his fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life,
      by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and intense
      application, he would have obtained, or at least he would have
      deserved, the highest honors of his profession; and Julian might
      have raised himself to the rank of minister, or general, of the
      state in which he was born a private citizen. If the jealous
      caprice of power had disappointed his expectations, if he had
      prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the
      same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the
      reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame. When
      we inspect, with minute, or perhaps malevolent attention, the
      portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace and
      perfection of the whole figure. His genius was less powerful and
      sublime than that of Cæsar; nor did he possess the consummate
      prudence of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan appear more steady
      and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is more simple and
      consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness, and
      prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and
      twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans
      beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and
      his pleasures; who labored to relieve the distress, and to revive
      the spirit, of his subjects; and who endeavored always to connect
      authority with merit, and happiness with virtue. Even faction,
      and religious faction, was constrained to acknowledge the
      superiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war, and to
      confess, with a sigh, that the apostate Julian was a lover of his
      country, and that he deserved the empire of the world. 85

     Jerusalem—His Artful Persecution Of The Christians.—Mutual Zeal
     And Injustice.


      The character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian;
      and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the
      real and apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance
      may represent him as a philosophic monarch, who studied to
      protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the
      empire; and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the
      minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile
      of Athanasius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct
      of Julian will remove this favorable prepossession for a prince
      who did not escape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy
      the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been
      delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies.
      The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and
      candid historian, the impartial spectator of his life and death.
      The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the
      public and private declarations of the emperor himself; and his
      various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious
      sentiments, which policy would have prompted him to dissemble
      rather than to affect. A devout and sincere attachment for the
      gods of Athens and Rome constituted the ruling passion of Julian;
      1 the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and
      corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice; and the
      phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real
      and pernicious effect on the government of the empire. The
      vehement zeal of the Christians, who despised the worship, and
      overturned the altars of those fabulous deities, engaged their
      votary in a state of irreconcilable hostility with a very
      numerous party of his subjects; and he was sometimes tempted by
      the desire of victory, or the shame of a repulse, to violate the
      laws of prudence, and even of justice. The triumph of the party,
      which he deserted and opposed, has fixed a stain of infamy on the
      name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been
      overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the
      signal was given by the sonorous trumpet 2 of Gregory Nazianzen.
      3 The interesting nature of the events which were crowded into
      the short reign of this active emperor, deserve a just and
      circumstantial narrative. His motives, his counsels, and his
      actions, as far as they are connected with the history of
      religion, will be the subject of the present chapter.

      bold assurance, that he has erected a monument not less durable,
      and much more portable, than the columns of Hercules. See Greg.

      friend Basil, (iv. p. 133,) about six months after the death of
      Julian, when his remains had been carried to Tarsus, (iv. p.
      120;) but while Jovian was still on the throne, (iii. p. 54, iv.
      p. 117) I have derived much assistance from a French version and
      remarks, printed at Lyons, 1735.]

      The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from
      the early period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the
      hands of the murderers of his family. The names of Christ and of
      Constantius, the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon
      associated in a youthful imagination, which was susceptible of
      the most lively impressions. The care of his infancy was
      intrusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, 4 who was related to
      him on the side of his mother; and till Julian reached the
      twentieth year of his age, he received from his Christian
      preceptors the education, not of a hero, but of a saint. The
      emperor, less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown,
      contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen,
      while he bestowed the advantages of baptism 5 on the nephews of
      Constantine. 6 They were even admitted to the inferior offices of
      the ecclesiastical order; and Julian publicly read the Holy
      Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia. The study of religion,
      which they assiduously cultivated, appeared to produce the
      fairest fruits of faith and devotion. 7 They prayed, they fasted,
      they distributed alms to the poor, gifts to the clergy, and
      oblations to the tombs of the martyrs; and the splendid monument
      of St. Mamas, at Cæsarea, was erected, or at least was
      undertaken, by the joint labor of Gallus and Julian. 8 They
      respectfully conversed with the bishops, who were eminent for
      superior sanctity, and solicited the benediction of the monks and
      hermits, who had introduced into Cappadocia the voluntary
      hardships of the ascetic life. 9 As the two princes advanced
      towards the years of manhood, they discovered, in their religious
      sentiments, the difference of their characters. The dull and
      obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced, with implicit zeal,
      the doctrines of Christianity; which never influenced his
      conduct, or moderated his passions. The mild disposition of the
      younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel;
      and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a
      theological system, which explains the mysterious essence of the
      Deity, and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future
      worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian refused to yield the
      passive and unresisting obedience which was required, in the name
      of religion, by the haughty ministers of the church. Their
      speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and guarded
      by the terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed
      the rigid formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions
      of the young prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and
      severely checked the freedom of his inquiries, they secretly
      provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his
      ecclesiastical guides. He was educated in the Lesser Asia, amidst
      the scandals of the Arian controversy. 10 The fierce contests of
      the Eastern bishops, the incessant alterations of their creeds,
      and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct,
      insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they
      neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so
      fiercely contended. Instead of listening to the proofs of
      Christianity with that favorable attention which adds weight to
      the most respectable evidence, he heard with suspicion, and
      disputed with obstinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which he
      already entertained an invincible aversion. Whenever the young
      princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of
      the prevailing controversies, Julian always declared himself the
      advocate of Paganism; under the specious excuse that, in the
      defence of the weaker cause, his learning and ingenuity might be
      more advantageously exercised and displayed.

      education, which inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration
      for the genius, and perhaps the religion of Homer. Misopogon, p.

      spectators, would form one of the clearest miracles in
      ecclesiastical story.]

      nature a gentle and social animal. The _Pagan_ supposes, that
      because they had renounced the gods, they were possessed and
      tormented by evil dæmons.]

      mourn the dead man precisely in the way which you approve.” He
      shows himself a tolerable theologian; but he maintains that the
      Christian Trinity is not derived from the doctrine of Paul, of
      Jesus, or of Moses.]

      As soon as Gallus was invested with the honors of the purple,
      Julian was permitted to breathe the air of freedom, of
      literature, and of Paganism. 11 The crowd of sophists, who were
      attracted by the taste and liberality of their royal pupil, had
      formed a strict alliance between the learning and the religion of
      Greece; and the poems of Homer, instead of being admired as the
      original productions of human genius, were seriously ascribed to
      the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses. The deities of
      Olympus, as they are painted by the immortal bard, imprint
      themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to
      superstitious credulity. Our familiar knowledge of their names
      and characters, their forms and attributes, _seems_ to bestow on
      those airy beings a real and substantial existence; and the
      pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent
      of the imagination to those fables, which are the most repugnant
      to our reason and experience. In the age of Julian, every
      circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion; the
      magnificent temples of Greece and Asia; the works of those
      artists who had expressed, in painting or in sculpture, the
      divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and
      sacrifices; the successful arts of divination; the popular
      traditions of oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of
      two thousand years. The weakness of polytheism was, in some
      measure, excused by the moderation of its claims; and the
      devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the most
      licentious scepticism. 12 Instead of an indivisible and regular
      system, which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind,
      the mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand loose and
      flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to
      define the degree and measure of his religious faith. The creed
      which Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest
      dimensions; and, by strange contradiction, he disdained the
      salutary yoke of the gospel, whilst he made a voluntary offering
      of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo. One of the
      orations of Julian is consecrated to the honor of Cybele, the
      mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests the
      bloody sacrifice, so rashly performed by the madness of the
      Phrygian boy. The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a
      blush, and without a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the
      shores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber, and the stupendous
      miracle, which convinced the senate and people of Rome that the
      lump of clay, which their ambassadors had transported over the
      seas, was endowed with life, and sentiment, and divine power. 13
      For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments
      of the city; and censures, with some acrimony, the sickly and
      affected taste of those men, who impertinently derided the sacred
      traditions of their ancestors. 14

      heaven on the Quirinal hill; and pities the strange blindness of
      the Christians, who preferred the cross to these celestial
      trophies. Apud Cyril. l. vi. p. 194.]

      But the devout philosopher, who sincerely embraced, and warmly
      encouraged, the superstition of the people, reserved for himself
      the privilege of a liberal interpretation; and silently withdrew
      from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple. The
      extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed, with a clear
      and audible voice, that the pious inquirer, instead of being
      scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense, should
      diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had been disguised,
      by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly and of
      fable. 15 The philosophers of the Platonic school, 16 Plotinus,
      Porphyry, and the divine Iamblichus, were admired as the most
      skilful masters of this allegorical science, which labored to
      soften and harmonize the deformed features of Paganism. Julian
      himself, who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by Ædesius,
      the venerable successor of Iamblichus, aspired to the possession
      of a treasure, which he esteemed, if we may credit his solemn
      asseverations, far above the empire of the world. 17 It was
      indeed a treasure, which derived its value only from opinion; and
      every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the
      precious ore from the surrounding dross, claimed an equal right
      of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his
      peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already
      explained by Porphyry; but his labors served only to animate the
      pious industry of Julian, who invented and published his own
      allegory of that ancient and mystic tale. This freedom of
      interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platonists,
      exposed the vanity of their art. Without a tedious detail, the
      modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange
      allusions, the forced etymologies, the solemn trifling, and the
      impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who professed to reveal
      the system of the universe. As the traditions of Pagan mythology
      were variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty
      to select the most convenient circumstances; and as they
      translated an arbitrary cipher, they could extract from _any_
      fable _any_ sense which was adapted to their favorite system of
      religion and philosophy. The lascivious form of a naked Venus was
      tortured into the discovery of some moral precept, or some
      physical truth; and the castration of Atys explained the
      revolution of the sun between the tropics, or the separation of
      the human soul from vice and error. 18

      15 (return) [ See the principles of allegory, in Julian, (Orat.
      vii. p. 216, 222.) His reasoning is less absurd than that of some
      modern theologians, who assert that an extravagant or
      contradictory doctrine must be divine; since no man alive could
      have thought of inventing it.]

      16 (return) [ Eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a
      partial and fanatical history; and the learned Brucker (Hist.
      Philosoph. tom. ii. p. 217-303) has employed much labor to
      illustrate their obscure lives and incomprehensible doctrines.]

      17 (return) [ Julian, Orat. vii p 222. He swears with the most
      fervent and enthusiastic devotion; and trembles, lest he should
      betray too much of these holy mysteries, which the profane might
      deride with an impious Sardonic laugh.]

      18 (return) [ See the fifth oration of Julian. But all the
      allegories which ever issued from the Platonic school are not
      worth the short poem of Catullus on the same extraordinary
      subject. The transition of Atys, from the wildest enthusiasm to
      sober, pathetic complaint, for his irretrievable loss, must
      inspire a man with pity, a eunuch with despair.]

      The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the
      sublime and important principles of natural religion. But as the
      faith, which is not founded on revelation, must remain destitute
      of any firm assurance, the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed
      into the habits of vulgar superstition; and the popular and
      philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in
      the practice, the writings, and even in the mind of Julian. 19
      The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of
      the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an
      infinite nature, invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the
      understanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or
      rather, in the Platonic language, had generated, the gradual
      succession of dependent spirits, of gods, of dæmons, of heroes,
      and of men; and every being which derived its existence
      immediately from the First Cause, received the inherent gift of
      immortality. That so precious an advantage might not be lavished
      upon unworthy objects, the Creator had intrusted to the skill and
      power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body,
      and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the
      vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of these
      divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this
      lower world; but their imperfect administration is not exempt
      from discord or error. The earth and its inhabitants are divided
      among them, and the characters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or
      Venus, may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their
      peculiar votaries. As long as our immortal souls are confined in
      a mortal prison, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to
      solicit the favor, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of
      heaven; whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind; and
      whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment
      from the fumes of sacrifice. 20 The inferior gods might sometimes
      condescend to animate the statues, and to inhabit the temples,
      which were dedicated to their honor. They might occasionally
      visit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and
      symbol of their glory. The invariable order of the sun, moon, and
      stars, was hastily admitted by Julian, as a proof of their
      _eternal_ duration; and their eternity was a sufficient evidence
      that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior deity, but of
      the Omnipotent King. In the system of Platonists, the visible was
      a type of the invisible world. The celestial bodies, as they were
      informed by a divine spirit, might be considered as the objects
      the most worthy of religious worship. The Sun, whose genial
      influence pervades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the
      adoration of mankind, as the bright representative of the Logos,
      the lively, the rational, the beneficent image of the
      intellectual Father. 21

      Cæsars, p. 308, with Spanheim’s notes and illustrations, from the
      fragments in Cyril, l. ii. p. 57, 58, and especially from the
      theological oration in Solem Regem, p. 130-158, addressed in the
      confidence of friendship, to the præfect Sallust.]

      20 (return) [ Julian adopts this gross conception by ascribing to
      his favorite Marcus Antoninus, (Cæsares, p. 333.) The Stoics and
      Platonists hesitated between the analogy of bodies and the purity
      of spirits; yet the gravest philosophers inclined to the
      whimsical fancy of Aristophanes and Lucian, that an unbelieving
      age might starve the immortal gods. See Observations de Spanheim,

      Christians for preferring a mortal to an immortal _Logos_.]

      In every age, the absence of genuine inspiration is supplied by
      the strong illusions of enthusiasm, and the mimic arts of
      imposture. If, in the time of Julian, these arts had been
      practised only by the pagan priests, for the support of an
      expiring cause, some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the
      interest and habits of the sacerdotal character. But it may
      appear a subject of surprise and scandal, that the philosophers
      themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious
      credulity of mankind, 22 and that the Grecian mysteries should
      have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern
      Platonists. They arrogantly pretended to control the order of
      nature, to explore the secrets of futurity, to command the
      service of the inferior dæmons, to enjoy the view and
      conversation of the superior gods, and by disengaging the soul
      from her material bands, to reunite that immortal particle with
      the Infinite and Divine Spirit.

      devils with horns and tails, Iamblichus evoked the genii of love,
      Eros and Anteros, from two adjacent fountains. Two beautiful boys
      issued from the water, fondly embraced him as their father, and
      retired at his command, p. 26, 27.]

      The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian tempted the
      philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest; which, from the
      situation of their young proselyte, might be productive of the
      most important consequences. 23 Julian imbibed the first
      rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the mouth of Ædesius,
      who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted school.
      But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal
      to the ardor, the diligence, the rapid conception of his pupil,
      two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthes and Eusebius,
      supplied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master.
      These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their
      respective parts; and they artfully contrived, by dark hints and
      affected disputes, to excite the impatient hopes of the
      _aspirant_, till they delivered him into the hands of their
      associate, Maximus, the boldest and most skilful master of the
      Theurgic science. By his hands, Julian was secretly initiated at
      Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age. His residence at
      Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and
      superstition.

      He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the
      mysteries of Eleusis, which, amidst the general decay of the
      Grecian worship, still retained some vestiges of their primæval
      sanctity; and such was the zeal of Julian, that he afterwards
      invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul, for the sole
      purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and sacrifices, the
      great work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies were
      performed in the depth of caverns, and in the silence of the
      night, and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was
      preserved by the discretion of the initiated, I shall not presume
      to describe the horrid sounds, and fiery apparitions, which were
      presented to the senses, or the imagination, of the credulous
      aspirant, 24 till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon
      him in a blaze of celestial light. 25 In the caverns of Ephesus
      and Eleusis, the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere,
      deep, and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might sometimes
      exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which may
      be observed, or at least suspected, in the characters of the most
      conscientious fanatics. From that moment he consecrated his life
      to the service of the gods; and while the occupations of war, of
      government, and of study, seemed to claim the whole measure of
      his time, a stated portion of the hours of the night was
      invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion. The
      temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and
      the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous
      rules of religious abstinence; and it was in honor of Pan or
      Mercury, of Hecate or Isis, that Julian, on particular days,
      denied himself the use of some particular food, which might have
      been offensive to his tutelar deities. By these voluntary fasts,
      he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and
      familiar visits with which he was honored by the celestial
      powers. Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself, we
      may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he
      lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses;
      that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their
      favorite hero; that they gently interrupted his slumbers by
      touching his hand or his hair; that they warned him of every
      impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdom,
      in every action of his life; and that he had acquired such an
      intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests, as readily to
      distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the
      form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules. 26 These sleeping or
      waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and
      fanaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an
      Egyptian monk. But the useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were
      consumed in these vain occupations. Julian could break from the
      dream of superstition to arm himself for battle; and after
      vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired
      into his tent, to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an
      empire, or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of
      literature and philosophy.

      The important secret of the apostasy of Julian was intrusted to
      the fidelity of the _initiated_, with whom he was united by the
      sacred ties of friendship and religion. 27 The pleasing rumor was
      cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship;
      and his future greatness became the object of the hopes, the
      prayers, and the predictions of the Pagans, in every province of
      the empire. From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte,
      they fondly expected the cure of every evil, and the restoration
      of every blessing; and instead of disapproving of the ardor of
      their pious wishes, Julian ingenuously confessed, that he was
      ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to
      his country and to his religion. But this religion was viewed
      with a hostile eye by the successor of Constantine, whose
      capricious passions altercately saved and threatened the life of
      Julian. The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited
      under a despotic government, which condescended to fear them; and
      if the Pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their
      superstition, the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the
      general toleration. The apostate soon became the presumptive heir
      of the monarchy, and his death could alone have appeased the just
      apprehensions of the Christians. 28 But the young prince, who
      aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr, consulted
      his safety by dissembling his religion; and the easy temper of
      polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect
      which he inwardly despised. Libanius has considered the hypocrisy
      of his friend as a subject, not of censure, but of praise. “As
      the statues of the gods,” says that orator, “which have been
      defiled with filth, are again placed in a magnificent temple, so
      the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian, after it
      had been purified from the errors and follies of his education.
      His sentiments were changed; but as it would have been dangerous
      to have avowed his sentiments, his conduct still continued the
      same. Very different from the ass in Æsop, who disguised himself
      with a lion’s hide, our lion was obliged to conceal himself under
      the skin of an ass; and, while he embraced the dictates of
      reason, to obey the laws of prudence and necessity.” 29 The
      dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten years, from his secret
      initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war; when he
      declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of
      Constantius. This state of constraint might contribute to
      strengthen his devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the
      obligation of assisting, on solemn festivals, at the assemblies
      of the Christians, Julian returned, with the impatience of a
      lover, to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic
      chapels of Jupiter and Mercury. But as every act of dissimulation
      must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession of
      Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion
      which oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to
      hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human
      nature, sincerity and courage.

      Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.—Part II.


      The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of
      the Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in
      the Roman empire; and in which he himself had been sanctified by
      the sacrament of baptism. But, as a philosopher, it was incumbent
      on him to justify his dissent from Christianity, which was
      supported by the number of its converts, by the chain of
      prophecy, the splendor of miracles, and the weight of evidence.
      The elaborate work, 30 which he composed amidst the preparations
      of the Persian war, contained the substance of those arguments
      which he had long revolved in his mind. Some fragments have been
      transcribed and preserved, by his adversary, the vehement Cyril
      of Alexandria; 31 and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit
      and learning, of sophistry and fanaticism. The elegance of the
      style and the rank of the author, recommended his writings to the
      public attention; 32 and in the impious list of the enemies of
      Christianity, the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the
      superior merit or reputation of Julian. The minds of the faithful
      were either seduced, or scandalized, or alarmed; and the pagans,
      who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute, derived,
      from the popular work of their Imperial missionary, an
      inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections. But in the
      assiduous prosecution of these theological studies, the emperor
      of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a
      polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation to
      maintain and propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he
      secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he
      wielded the weapons of controversy, he was tempted to distrust
      the sincerity, or to despise the understandings, of his
      antagonists, who could obstinately resist the force of reason and
      eloquence.

      executed a task which had been feebly attempted by Philip of
      Side, a prolix and contemptible writer. Even the work of Cyril
      has not entirely satisfied the most favorable judges; and the
      Abbé de la Bleterie (Preface a l’Hist. de Jovien, p. 30, 32)
      wishes that some _theologien philosophe_ (a strange centaur)
      would undertake the refutation of Julian.]

      32 (return) [ Libanius, (Orat. Parental. c. lxxxvii. p. 313,) who
      has been suspected of assisting his friend, prefers this divine
      vindication (Orat. ix in necem Julian. p. 255, edit. Morel.) to
      the writings of Porphyry. His judgment may be arraigned,
      (Socrates, l. iii. c. 23,) but Libanius cannot be accused of
      flattery to a dead prince.]

      The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the
      apostasy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than
      from his arguments. The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent
      zeal, expected, perhaps with impatience, that the flames of
      persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of
      the gods; and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent
      some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been
      unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors.
      But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions
      were apparently disappointed, by the prudent humanity of a
      prince, 33 who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace,
      and of the rights of mankind. Instructed by history and
      reflection, Julian was persuaded, that if the diseases of the
      body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither steel
      nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The
      reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the
      heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the
      hand. Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by
      oppression; and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who
      have yielded are restored as penitents, and those who have
      resisted are honored as saints and martyrs. If Julian adopted the
      unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was
      sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of a
      tyrant, and add new glories to the Catholic church, which had
      derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan
      magistrates. Actuated by these motives, and apprehensive of
      disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign, Julian surprised the
      world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a statesman, or a
      philosopher. He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman
      world the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only
      hardship which he inflicted on the Christians, was to deprive
      them of the power of tormenting their fellow-subjects, whom they
      stigmatized with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The
      pagans received a gracious permission, or rather an express
      order, to open All their temples; 34 and they were at once
      delivered from the oppressive laws, and arbitrary vexations,
      which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of
      his sons. At the same time the bishops and clergy, who had been
      banished by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and
      restored to their respective churches; the Donatists, the
      Novatians, the Macedonians, the Eunomians, and those who, with a
      more prosperous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the Council
      of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided their theological
      disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects,
      that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious
      encounters. The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the
      emperor to exclaim, “Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the
      Alemanni;” but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with
      more obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the
      powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord, or at
      least in peace, he was perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed
      them from his presence, that he had nothing to dread from the
      union of the Christians. The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this
      affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine
      divisions of the church, and the insidious design of undermining
      the foundations of Christianity, was inseparably connected with
      the zeal which Julian professed, to restore the ancient religion
      of the empire. 35

      Bostra, Julian himself (Epist. lii.) professes his moderation,

      his public manifesto to the Athenians. This unquestionable
      evidence may correct the hasty assertion of Ammianus, who seems
      to suppose Constantinople to be the place where he discovered his
      attachment to the gods]

      As soon as he ascended the throne, he assumed, according to the
      custom of his predecessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not
      only as the most honorable title of Imperial greatness, but as a
      sacred and important office; the duties of which he was resolved
      to execute with pious diligence. As the business of the state
      prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public
      devotion of his subjects, he dedicated a domestic chapel to his
      tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with statues and
      altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace displaced
      the appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he saluted
      the parent of light with a sacrifice; the blood of another victim
      was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon; and
      the Moon, the Stars, and the Genii of the night received their
      respective and seasonable honors from the indefatigable devotion
      of Julian. On solemn festivals, he regularly visited the temple
      of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated,
      and endeavored to excite the religion of the magistrates and
      people by the example of his own zeal. Instead of maintaining the
      lofty state of a monarch, distinguished by the splendor of his
      purple, and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards,
      Julian solicited, with respectful eagerness, the meanest offices
      which contributed to the worship of the gods. Amidst the sacred
      but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior ministers, and of
      female dancers, who were dedicated to the service of the temple,
      it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the
      fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and,
      thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring
      animal, to draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the
      consummate skill of an haruspex, imaginary signs of future
      events. The wisest of the Pagans censured this extravagant
      superstition, which affected to despise the restraints of
      prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who practised
      the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship
      consumed a very large portion of the revenue; a constant supply
      of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from
      distant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods; a hundred
      oxen were frequently sacrificed by Julian on one and the same
      day; and it soon became a popular jest, that if he should return
      with conquest from the Persian war, the breed of horned cattle
      must infallibly be extinguished. Yet this expense may appear
      inconsiderable, when it is compared with the splendid presents
      which were offered either by the hand, or by order, of the
      emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman
      world; and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the
      ancient temples, which had suffered the silent decay of time, or
      the recent injuries of Christian rapine. Encouraged by the
      example, the exhortations, the liberality, of their pious
      sovereign, the cities and families resumed the practice of their
      neglected ceremonies. “Every part of the world,” exclaims
      Libanius, with devout transport, “displayed the triumph of
      religion; and the grateful prospect of flaming altars, bleeding
      victims, the smoke of incense, and a solemn train of priests and
      prophets, without fear and without danger. The sound of prayer
      and of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains; and
      the same ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods, and a supper for
      their joyous votaries.” 36

      36 (return) [ The restoration of the Pagan worship is described
      by Julian, (Misopogon, p. 346,) Libanius, (Orat. Parent. c. 60,
      p. 286, 287, and Orat. Consular. ad Julian. p. 245, 246, edit.
      Morel.,) Ammianus, (xxii. 12,) and Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv.
      p. 121.) These writers agree in the essential, and even minute,
      facts; but the different lights in which they view the extreme
      devotion of Julian, are expressive of the gradations of
      self-applause, passionate admiration, mild reproof, and partial
      invective.]

      But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise
      of restoring a religion which was destitute of theological
      principles, of moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline;
      which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution, and was not
      susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation. The
      jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more especially after that
      office had been united with the Imperial dignity, comprehended
      the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his
      vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers
      whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution
      of his great design; and his pastoral letters, 37 if we may use
      that name, still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes
      and intentions. He directs, that in every city the sacerdotal
      order should be composed, without any distinction of birth and
      fortune, of those persons who were the most conspicuous for the
      love of the gods, and of men. “If they are guilty,” continues he,
      “of any scandalous offence, they should be censured or degraded
      by the superior pontiff; but as long as they retain their rank,
      they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people.
      Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic
      garb; their dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are
      summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar, they ought
      not, during the appointed number of days, to depart from the
      precincts of the temple; nor should a single day be suffered to
      elapse, without the prayers and the sacrifice, which they are
      obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state, and of
      individuals. The exercise of their sacred functions requires an
      immaculate purity, both of mind and body; and even when they are
      dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life, it
      is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of
      their fellow-citizens. The priest of the gods should never be
      seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should be chaste,
      his diet temperate, his friends of honorable reputation; and if
      he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear
      only as the advocate of those who have vainly solicited either
      justice or mercy. His studies should be suited to the sanctity of
      his profession. Licentious tales, or comedies, or satires, must
      be banished from his library, which ought solely to consist of
      historical or philosophical writings; of history, which is
      founded in truth, and of philosophy, which is connected with
      religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics
      deserve his abhorrence and contempt; 38 but he should diligently
      study the systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics,
      which unanimously teach that there _are_ gods; that the world is
      governed by their providence; that their goodness is the source
      of every temporal blessing; and that they have prepared for the
      human soul a future state of reward or punishment.” The Imperial
      pontiff inculcates, in the most persuasive language, the duties
      of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts his inferior clergy to
      recommend the universal practice of those virtues; promises to
      assist their indigence from the public treasury; and declares his
      resolution of establishing hospitals in every city, where the
      poor should be received without any invidious distinction of
      country or of religion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and
      humane regulations of the church; and he very frankly confesses
      his intention to deprive the Christians of the applause, as well
      as advantage, which they had acquired by the exclusive practice
      of charity and beneficence. 39 The same spirit of imitation might
      dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions,
      the use and importance of which were approved by the success of
      his enemies. But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been
      realized, the forced and imperfect copy would have been less
      beneficial to Paganism, than honorable to Christianity. 40 The
      Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors,
      were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of
      foreign manners; and in the short period of his reign, Julian had
      frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervor of his own
      party. 41

      and curious fragment, without beginning or end, (p. 288-305.) The
      supreme pontiff derides the Mosaic history and the Christian
      discipline, prefers the Greek poets to the Hebrew prophets, and
      palliates, with the skill of a Jesuit the _relative_ worship of
      images.]

      38 (return) [ The exultation of Julian (p. 301) that these
      impious sects and even their writings, are extinguished, may be
      consistent enough with the sacerdotal character; but it is
      unworthy of a philosopher to wish that any opinions and arguments
      the most repugnant to his own should be concealed from the
      knowledge of mankind.]

      pretence of charity, inveigled children from their religion and
      parents, conveyed them on shipboard, and devoted those victims to
      a life of poverty or pervitude in a remote country, (p. 305.) Had
      the charge been proved it was his duty, not to complain, but to
      punish.]

      40 (return) [ Gregory Nazianzen is facetious, ingenious, and
      argumentative, (Orat. iii. p. 101, 102, &c.) He ridicules the
      folly of such vain imitation; and amuses himself with inquiring,
      what lessons, moral or theological, could be extracted from the
      Grecian fables.]

      41 (return) [ He accuses one of his pontiffs of a secret
      confederacy with the Christian bishops and presbyters, (Epist.
      lxii.) &c. Epist. lxiii.]

      The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of
      Jupiter as his personal friends and brethren; and though he
      partially overlooked the merit of Christian constancy, he admired
      and rewarded the noble perseverance of those Gentiles who had
      preferred the favor of the gods to that of the emperor. 42 If
      they cultivated the literature, as well as the religion, of the
      Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the friendship of
      Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar
      deities. In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning
      were almost synonymous; 43 and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians,
      and of philosophers, hastened to the Imperial court, to occupy
      the vacant places of the bishops, who had seduced the credulity
      of Constantius. His successor esteemed the ties of common
      initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity; he
      chose his favorites among the sages, who were deeply skilled in
      the occult sciences of magic and divination; and every impostor,
      who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity, was assured of
      enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence. 44 Among the
      philosophers, Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the
      friendship of his royal disciple, who communicated, with
      unreserved confidence, his actions, his sentiments, and his
      religious designs, during the anxious suspense of the civil war.
      45 As soon as Julian had taken possession of the palace of
      Constantinople, he despatched an honorable and pressing
      invitation to Maximus, who then resided at Sardes in Lydia, with
      Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies. The prudent
      and superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey
      which showed itself, according to the rules of divination, with
      the most threatening and malignant aspect: but his companion,
      whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast, persisted in his
      interrogations, till he had extorted from the gods a seeming
      consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor. The journey
      of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of
      philosophic vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in
      the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of
      their sovereign. Julian was pronouncing an oration before the
      senate, when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus. The
      emperor immediately interrupted his discourse, advanced to meet
      him, and after a tender embrace, conducted him by the hand into
      the midst of the assembly; where he publicly acknowledged the
      benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the
      philosopher. Maximus, 46 who soon acquired the confidence, and
      influenced the councils of Julian, was insensibly corrupted by
      the temptations of a court. His dress became more splendid, his
      demeanor more lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding
      reign, to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the
      disciple of Plato had accumulated, in the short duration of his
      favor, a very scandalous proportion of wealth. Of the other
      philosophers and sophists, who were invited to the Imperial
      residence by the choice of Julian, or by the success of Maximus,
      few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation.
      The liberal gifts of money, lands, and houses, were insufficient
      to satiate their rapacious avarice; and the indignation of the
      people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject
      poverty and disinterested professions. The penetration of Julian
      could not always be deceived: but he was unwilling to despise the
      characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem: he
      desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and
      inconstancy; and he was apprehensive of degrading, in the eyes of
      the profane, the honor of letters and of religion. 47 48

      Some students, whose expectations perhaps were groundless, or
      extravagant, retired in disgust, (Greg. Naz. Orat. iv. p. 120.)
      It is strange that we should not be able to contradict the title
      of one of Tillemont’s chapters, (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p.
      960,) “La Cour de Julien est pleine de philosphes et de gens
      perdus.”]

      The favor of Julian was almost equally divided between the
      Pagans, who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors,
      and the Christians, who prudently embraced the religion of their
      sovereign. The acquisition of new proselytes 49 gratified the
      ruling passions of his soul, superstition and vanity; and he was
      heard to declare, with the enthusiasm of a missionary, that if he
      could render each individual richer than Midas, and every city
      greater than Babylon, he should not esteem himself the benefactor
      of mankind, unless, at the same time, he could reclaim his
      subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods. 50
      A prince who had studied human nature, and who possessed the
      treasures of the Roman empire, could adapt his arguments, his
      promises, and his rewards, to every order of Christians; 51 and
      the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the
      defects of a candidate, or even to expiate the guilt of a
      criminal. As the army is the most forcible engine of absolute
      power, Julian applied himself, with peculiar diligence, to
      corrupt the religion of his troops, without whose hearty
      concurrence every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful; and
      the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it
      was important. The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the
      faith, as well as to the fortunes, of their victorious leader;
      and even before the death of Constantius, he had the satisfaction
      of announcing to his friends, that they assisted with fervent
      devotion, and voracious appetite, at the sacrifices, which were
      repeatedly offered in his camp, of whole hecatombs of fat oxen.
      52 The armies of the East, which had been trained under the
      standard of the cross, and of Constantius, required a more artful
      and expensive mode of persuasion. On the days of solemn and
      public festivals, the emperor received the homage, and rewarded
      the merit, of the troops. His throne of state was encircled with
      the military ensigns of Rome and the republic; the holy name of
      Christ was erased from the _Labarum;_ and the symbols of war, of
      majesty, and of pagan superstition, were so dexterously blended,
      that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry, when he
      respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign. The
      soldiers passed successively in review; and each of them, before
      he received from the hand of Julian a liberal donative,
      proportioned to his rank and services, was required to cast a few
      grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar. Some
      Christian confessors might resist, and others might repent; but
      the far greater number, allured by the prospect of gold, and awed
      by the presence of the emperor, contracted the criminal
      engagement; and their future perseverance in the worship of the
      gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest.

      By the frequent repetition of these arts, and at the expense of
      sums which would have purchased the service of half the nations
      of Scythia, Julian gradually acquired for his troops the
      imaginary protection of the gods, and for himself the firm and
      effectual support of the Roman legions. 53 It is indeed more than
      probable, that the restoration and encouragement of Paganism
      revealed a multitude of pretended Christians, who, from motives
      of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in the religion of the
      former reign; and who afterwards returned, with the same
      flexibility of conscience, to the faith which was professed by
      the successors of Julian.

      into England.]

      While the devout monarch incessantly labored to restore and
      propagate the religion of his ancestors, he embraced the
      extraordinary design of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem. In a
      public epistle 54 to the nation or community of the Jews,
      dispersed through the provinces, he pities their misfortunes,
      condemns their oppressors, praises their constancy, declares
      himself their gracious protector, and expresses a pious hope,
      that after his return from the Persian war, he may be permitted
      to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city of
      Jerusalem. The blind superstition, and abject slavery, of those
      unfortunate exiles, must excite the contempt of a philosophic
      emperor; but they deserved the friendship of Julian, by their
      implacable hatred of the Christian name. The barren synagogue
      abhorred and envied the fecundity of the rebellious church; the
      power of the Jews was not equal to their malice; but their
      gravest rabbis approved the private murder of an apostate; 55 and
      their seditious clamors had often awakened the indolence of the
      Pagan magistrates. Under the reign of Constantine, the Jews
      became the subjects of their revolted children nor was it long
      before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny. The
      civil immunities which had been granted, or confirmed, by
      Severus, were gradually repealed by the Christian princes; and a
      rash tumult, excited by the Jews of Palestine, 56 seemed to
      justify the lucrative modes of oppression which were invented by
      the bishops and eunuchs of the court of Constantius. The Jewish
      patriarch, who was still permitted to exercise a precarious
      jurisdiction, held his residence at Tiberias; 57 and the
      neighboring cities of Palestine were filled with the remains of a
      people who fondly adhered to the promised land. But the edict of
      Hadrian was renewed and enforced; and they viewed from afar the
      walls of the holy city, which were profaned in their eyes by the
      triumph of the cross and the devotion of the Christians. 58

      In the midst of a rocky and barren country, the walls of
      Jerusalem 59 enclosed the two mountains of Sion and Acra, within
      an oval figure of about three English miles. 60 Towards the
      south, the upper town, and the fortress of David, were erected on
      the lofty ascent of Mount Sion: on the north side, the buildings
      of the lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra; and
      a part of the hill, distinguished by the name of Moriah, and
      levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately temple
      of the Jewish nation. After the final destruction of the temple
      by the arms of Titus and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over
      the consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction. Sion
      was deserted; and the vacant space of the lower city was filled
      with the public and private edifices of the Ælian colony, which
      spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary. The holy
      places were polluted with mountains of idolatry; and, either from
      design or accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus, on the spot
      which had been sanctified by the death and resurrection of
      Christ. 61 6111 Almost three hundred years after those stupendous
      events, the profane chapel of Venus was demolished by the order
      of Constantine; and the removal of the earth and stones revealed
      the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind. A magnificent church
      was erected on that mystic ground, by the first Christian
      emperor; and the effects of his pious munificence were extended
      to every spot which had been consecrated by the footstep of
      patriarchs, of prophets, and of the Son of God. 62

      The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of
      their redemption attracted to Jerusalem a successive crowd of
      pilgrims, from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most
      distant countries of the East; 63 and their piety was authorized
      by the example of the empress Helena, who appears to have united
      the credulity of age with the warm feelings of a recent
      conversion. Sages and heroes, who have visited the memorable
      scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the inspiration
      of the genius of the place; 64 and the Christian who knelt before
      the holy sepulchre, ascribed his lively faith, and his fervent
      devotion, to the more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit.
      The zeal, perhaps the avarice, of the clergy of Jerusalem,
      cherished and multiplied these beneficial visits. They fixed, by
      unquestionable tradition, the scene of each memorable event. They
      exhibited the instruments which had been used in the passion of
      Christ; the nails and the lance that had pierced his hands, his
      feet, and his side; the crown of thorns that was planted on his
      head; the pillar at which he was scourged; and, above all, they
      showed the cross on which he suffered, and which was dug out of
      the earth in the reign of those princes, who inserted the symbol
      of Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions. 65 Such
      miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary
      preservation, and seasonable discovery, were gradually propagated
      without opposition. The custody of the _true cross_, which on
      Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was intrusted
      to the bishop of Jerusalem; and he alone might gratify the
      curious devotion of the pilgrims, by the gift of small pieces,
      which they encased in gold or gems, and carried away in triumph
      to their respective countries. But as this gainful branch of
      commerce must soon have been annihilated, it was found convenient
      to suppose, that the marvelous wood possessed a secret power of
      vegetation; and that its substance, though continually
      diminished, still remained entire and unimpaired. 66 It might
      perhaps have been expected, that the influence of the place and
      the belief of a perpetual miracle, should have produced some
      salutary effects on the morals, as well as on the faith, of the
      people. Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers
      have been obliged to confess, not only that the streets of
      Jerusalem were filled with the incessant tumult of business and
      pleasure, 67 but that every species of vice—adultery, theft,
      idolatry, poisoning, murder—was familiar to the inhabitants of
      the holy city. 68 The wealth and preëminence of the church of
      Jerusalem excited the ambition of Arian, as well as orthodox,
      candidates; and the virtues of Cyril, who, since his death, has
      been honored with the title of Saint, were displayed in the
      exercise, rather than in the acquisition, of his episcopal
      dignity. 69

      The vain and ambitious mind of Julian might aspire to restore the
      ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem. 70 As the Christians
      were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction
      had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law,
      the Imperial sophist would have converted the success of his
      undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of
      prophecy, and the truth of revelation. 71 He was displeased with
      the spiritual worship of the synagogue; but he approved the
      institutions of Moses, who had not disdained to adopt many of the
      rites and ceremonies of Egypt. 72 The local and national deity of
      the Jews was sincerely adored by a polytheist, who desired only
      to multiply the number of the gods; 73 and such was the appetite
      of Julian for bloody sacrifice, that his emulation might be
      excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered, at the feast of
      the dedication, twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and
      twenty thousand sheep. 74 These considerations might influence
      his designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important
      advantage would not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the
      remote and uncertain event of the Persian war. He resolved to
      erect, without delay, on the commanding eminence of Moriah, a
      stately temple, which might eclipse the splendor of the church of
      the resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary; to establish an
      order of priests, whose interested zeal would detect the arts,
      and resist the ambition, of their Christian rivals; and to invite
      a numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be always
      prepared to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures
      of the Pagan government. Among the friends of the emperor (if the
      names of emperor, and of friend, are not incompatible) the first
      place was assigned, by Julian himself, to the virtuous and
      learned Alypius. 75 The humanity of Alypius was tempered by
      severe justice and manly fortitude; and while he exercised his
      abilities in the civil administration of Britain, he imitated, in
      his poetical compositions, the harmony and softness of the odes
      of Sappho. This minister, to whom Julian communicated, without
      reserve, his most careless levities, and his most serious
      counsels, received an extraordinary commission to restore, in its
      pristine beauty, the temple of Jerusalem; and the diligence of
      Alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the
      governor of Palestine. At the call of their great deliverer, the
      Jews, from all the provinces of the empire, assembled on the holy
      mountain of their fathers; and their insolent triumph alarmed and
      exasperated the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem. The desire of
      rebuilding the temple has in every age been the ruling passion of
      the children of Israel. In this propitious moment the men forgot
      their avarice, and the women their delicacy; spades and pickaxes
      of silver were provided by the vanity of the rich, and the
      rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple. Every
      purse was opened in liberal contributions, every hand claimed a
      share in the pious labor, and the commands of a great monarch
      were executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people. 76

      Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm
      were unsuccessful; and the ground of the Jewish temple, which is
      now covered by a Mahometan mosque, 77 still continued to exhibit
      the same edifying spectacle of ruin and desolation. Perhaps the
      absence and death of the emperor, and the new maxims of a
      Christian reign, might explain the interruption of an arduous
      work, which was attempted only in the last six months of the life
      of Julian. 78 But the Christians entertained a natural and pious
      expectation, that, in this memorable contest, the honor of
      religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle. An
      earthquake, a whirlwind, and a fiery eruption, which overturned
      and scattered the new foundations of the temple, are attested,
      with some variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence.
      79 This public event is described by Ambrose, 80 bishop of Milan,
      in an epistle to the emperor Theodosius, which must provoke the
      severe animadversion of the Jews; by the eloquent Chrysostom, 81
      who might appeal to the memory of the elder part of his
      congregation at Antioch; and by Gregory Nazianzen, 82 who
      published his account of the miracle before the expiration of the
      same year. The last of these writers has boldly declared, that
      this preternatural event was not disputed by the infidels; and
      his assertion, strange as it may seem is confirmed by the
      unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. 83 The
      philosophic soldier, who loved the virtues, without adopting the
      prejudices, of his master, has recorded, in his judicious and
      candid history of his own times, the extraordinary obstacles
      which interrupted the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem.
      “Whilst Alypius, assisted by the governor of the province, urged,
      with vigor and diligence, the execution of the work, horrible
      balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with frequent
      and reiterated attacks, rendered the place, from time to time,
      inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the
      victorious element continuing in this manner obstinately and
      resolutely bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, the
      undertaking was abandoned.” 8311 Such authority should satisfy a
      believing, and must astonish an incredulous, mind. Yet a
      philosopher may still require the original evidence of impartial
      and intelligent spectators. At this important crisis, any
      singular accident of nature would assume the appearance, and
      produce the effects of a real prodigy. This glorious deliverance
      would be speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the
      clergy of Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the Christian
      world and, at the distance of twenty years, a Roman historian,
      careless of theological disputes, might adorn his work with the
      specious and splendid miracle. 84

      positive testimony of Ammianus, a contemporary and a pagan, will
      not permit us to call in question. It was suggested by a passage
      in Tacitus. That historian, speaking of Jerusalem, says, [I omit
      the first part of the quotation adduced by M. Guizot, which only
      by a most extraordinary mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati
      by “_enfoncemens_” could be made to bear on the question.—M.]
      “The Temple itself was a kind of citadel, which had its own
      walls, superior in their workmanship and construction to those of
      the city. The porticos themselves, which surrounded the temple,
      were an excellent fortification. There was a fountain of
      constantly running water; _subterranean excavations under the
      mountain; reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain-water_.”
      Tac. Hist. v. ii. 12. These excavations and reservoirs must have
      been very considerable. The latter furnished water during the
      whole siege of Jerusalem to 1,100,000 inhabitants, for whom the
      fountain of Siloe could not have sufficed, and who had no fresh
      rain-water, the siege having taken place from the month of April
      to the month of August, a period of the year during which it
      rarely rains in Jerusalem. As to the excavations, they served
      after, and even before, the return of the Jews from Babylon, to
      contain not only magazines of oil, wine, and corn, but also the
      treasures which were laid up in the Temple. Josephus has related
      several incidents which show their extent. When Jerusalem was on
      the point of being taken by Titus, the rebel chiefs, placing
      their last hopes in these vast subterranean cavities, formed a
      design of concealing themselves there, and remaining during the
      conflagration of the city, and until the Romans had retired to a
      distance. The greater part had not time to execute their design;
      but one of them, Simon, the Son of Gioras, having provided
      himself with food, and tools to excavate the earth descended into
      this retreat with some companions: he remained there till Titus
      had set out for Rome: under the pressure of famine he issued
      forth on a sudden in the very place where the Temple had stood,
      and appeared in the midst of the Roman guard. He was seized and
      carried to Rome for the triumph. His appearance made it be
      suspected that other Jews might have chosen the same asylum;
      search was made, and a great number discovered. Joseph. de Bell.
      Jud. l. vii. c. 2. It is probable that the greater part of these
      excavations were the remains of the time of Solomon, when it was
      the custom to work to a great extent under ground: no other date
      can be assigned to them. The Jews, on their return from the
      captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and, although
      Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph.
      Ant. Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was
      completed will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that
      period. Some were used for sewers and drains, others served to
      conceal the immense treasures of which Crassus, a hundred and
      twenty years before, plundered the Jews, and which doubtless had
      been since replaced. The Temple was destroyed A. C. 70; the
      attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact related by
      Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed
      between these two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during
      which the excavations, choked up with ruins, must have become
      full of inflammable air. The workmen employed by Julian as they
      were digging, arrived at the excavations of the Temple; they
      would take torches to explore them; sudden flames repelled those
      who approached; explosions were heard, and these phenomena were
      renewed every time that they penetrated into new subterranean
      passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an
      event nearly similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that
      immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David,
      he descended into it with a few confidential persons; he found in
      the first subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs:
      but having wished to penetrate into a second chamber, which had
      been long closed, he was repelled, when he opened it, by flames
      which killed those who accompanied him. (Ant. Jud. xvi. 7, i.) As
      here there is no room for miracle, this fact may be considered as
      a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus and the
      contemporary writers.—G. ——To the illustrations of the extent of
      the subterranean chambers adduced by Michaelis, may be added,
      that when John of Gischala, during the siege, surprised the
      Temple, the party of Eleazar took refuge within them. Bell. Jud.

      soon die; or, if the air is inflammable, a little flame is seen
      to flicker round the lamp, which spreads and multiplies till the
      conflagration becomes general, is followed by an explosion, and

      Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.—Part IV.


      The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with
      the ruin of the Christian church. Julian still continued to
      maintain the freedom of religious worship, without distinguishing
      whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or
      his clemency. He affected to pity the unhappy Christians, who
      were mistaken in the most important object of their lives; but
      his pity was degraded by contempt, his contempt was embittered by
      hatred; and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a style of
      sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly wound, whenever
      it issues from the mouth of a sovereign. As he was sensible that
      the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer, he
      countenanced, and perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honorable
      appellation of Galilæans. 85 He declared, that by the folly of
      the Galilæans, whom he describes as a sect of fanatics,
      contemptible to men, and odious to the gods, the empire had been
      reduced to the brink of destruction; and he insinuates in a
      public edict, that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by
      salutary violence. 86 An ungenerous distinction was admitted into
      the mind and counsels of Julian, that, according to the
      difference of their religious sentiments, one part of his
      subjects deserved his favor and friendship, while the other was
      entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not
      refuse to an obedient people. According to a principle, pregnant
      with mischief and oppression, the emperor transferred to the
      pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal
      allowances from the public revenue, which had been granted to the
      church by the piety of Constantine and his sons. The proud system
      of clerical honors and immunities, which had been constructed
      with so much art and labor, was levelled to the ground; the hopes
      of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigor of the
      laws; and the priests of the Christian sect were confounded with
      the last and most ignominious class of the people. Such of these
      regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and
      avarice of the ecclesiastics, were soon afterwards imitated by
      the wisdom of an orthodox prince. The peculiar distinctions which
      policy has bestowed, or superstition has lavished, on the
      sacerdotal order, _must_ be confined to those priests who profess
      the religion of the state. But the will of the legislator was not
      exempt from prejudice and passion; and it was the object of the
      insidious policy of Julian, to deprive the Christians of all the
      temporal honors and advantages which rendered them respectable in
      the eyes of the world. 88

      confirmed by the invariable practice of Julian himself. Warburton
      has justly observed (p. 35,) that the Platonists believed in the
      mysterious virtue of words and Julian’s dislike for the name of
      Christ might proceed from superstition, as well as from
      contempt.]

      88 (return) [ These laws, which affected the clergy, may be found
      in the slight hints of Julian himself, (Epist. lii.) in the vague
      declamations of Gregory, (Orat. iii. p. 86, 87,) and in the
      positive assertions of Sozomen, (l. v. c. 5.)]

      A just and severe censure has been inflicted on the law which
      prohibited the Christians from teaching the arts of grammar and
      rhetoric. 89 The motives alleged by the emperor to justify this
      partial and oppressive measure, might command, during his
      lifetime, the silence of slaves and the applause of Gatterers.
      Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which might be
      indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the
      Greeks: he contemptuously observes, that the men who exalt the
      merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the
      advantages of science; and he vainly contends, that if they
      refuse to adore the gods of Homer and Demosthenes, they ought to
      content themselves with expounding Luke and Matthew in the church
      of the Galilæans. 90 In all the cities of the Roman world, the
      education of the youth was intrusted to masters of grammar and
      rhetoric; who were elected by the magistrates, maintained at the
      public expense, and distinguished by many lucrative and honorable
      privileges. The edict of Julian appears to have included the
      physicians, and professors of all the liberal arts; and the
      emperor, who reserved to himself the approbation of the
      candidates, was authorized by the laws to corrupt, or to punish,
      the religious constancy of the most learned of the Christians. 91
      As soon as the resignation of the more obstinate 92 teachers had
      established the unrivalled dominion of the Pagan sophists, Julian
      invited the rising generation to resort with freedom to the
      public schools, in a just confidence, that their tender minds
      would receive the impressions of literature and idolatry. If the
      greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred by their
      own scruples, or by those of their parents, from accepting this
      dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time,
      relinquish the benefits of a liberal education. Julian had reason
      to expect that, in the space of a few years, the church would
      relapse into its primæval simplicity, and that the theologians,
      who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of
      the age, would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant
      fanatics, incapable of defending the truth of their own
      principles, or of exposing the various follies of Polytheism. 93

      It was undoubtedly the wish and design of Julian to deprive the
      Christians of the advantages of wealth, of knowledge, and of
      power; but the injustice of excluding them from all offices of
      trust and profit seems to have been the result of his general
      policy, rather than the immediate consequence of any positive
      law. 94 Superior merit might deserve and obtain, some
      extraordinary exceptions; but the greater part of the Christian
      officers were gradually removed from their employments in the
      state, the army, and the provinces. The hopes of future
      candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a
      prince, who maliciously reminded them, that it was unlawful for a
      Christian to use the sword, either of justice, or of war; and who
      studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of
      idolatry. The powers of government were intrusted to the pagans,
      who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors;
      and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules
      of divination, the favorites whom he preferred as the most
      agreeable to the gods, did not always obtain the approbation of
      mankind. 95 Under the administration of their enemies, the
      Christians had much to suffer, and more to apprehend. The temper
      of Julian was averse to cruelty; and the care of his reputation,
      which was exposed to the eyes of the universe, restrained the
      philosophic monarch from violating the laws of justice and
      toleration, which he himself had so recently established. But the
      provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less
      conspicuous station. In the exercise of arbitrary power, they
      consulted the wishes, rather than the commands, of their
      sovereign; and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious
      tyranny against the sectaries, on whom they were not permitted to
      confer the honors of martyrdom. The emperor, who dissembled as
      long as possible his knowledge of the injustice that was
      exercised in his name, expressed his real sense of the conduct of
      his officers, by gentle reproofs and substantial rewards. 96

      94 (return) [ It was the instruction of Julian to his
      magistrates, (Epist. vii.,). Sozomen (l. v. c. 18) and Socrates
      (l. iii. c. 13) must be reduced to the standard of Gregory,
      (Orat. iii. p. 95,) not less prone to exaggeration, but more
      restrained by the actual knowledge of his contemporary readers.]

      iii. c. 14. The doret, l. iii. c. 6. Some drawback may, however,
      be allowed for the violence of _their_ zeal, not less partial
      than the zeal of Julian]

      The most effectual instrument of oppression, with which they were
      armed, was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and
      ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under
      the preceding reign. The zeal of the triumphant church had not
      always expected the sanction of the public authority; and the
      bishops, who were secure of impunity, had often marched at the
      head of their congregation, to attack and demolish the fortresses
      of the prince of darkness. The consecrated lands, which had
      increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy, were
      clearly defined, and easily restored. But on these lands, and on
      the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had frequently
      erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary to
      remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice
      and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party, while the
      other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence. 97 After
      the ground was cleared, the restitution of those stately
      structures which had been levelled with the dust, and of the
      precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses,
      swelled into a very large account of damages and debt. The
      authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination
      to discharge this accumulated demand: and the impartial wisdom of
      a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse
      claims and complaints, by an equitable and temperate arbitration.

      But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into
      confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan
      magistrates, inflamed by zeal and revenge, abused the rigorous
      privilege of the Roman law, which substitutes, in the place of
      his inadequate property, the person of the insolvent debtor.
      Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop of Arethusa, 98 had
      labored in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual
      than those of persuasion. 99 The magistrates required the full
      value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant
      zeal: but as they were satisfied of his poverty, they desired
      only to bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the
      slightest compensation. They apprehended the aged prelate, they
      inhumanly scourged him, they tore his beard; and his naked body,
      annointed with honey, was suspended, in a net, between heaven and
      earth, and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a
      Syrian sun. 100 From this lofty station, Mark still persisted to
      glory in his crime, and to insult the impotent rage of his
      persecutors. He was at length rescued from their hands, and
      dismissed to enjoy the honor of his divine triumph. The Arians
      celebrated the virtue of their pious confessor; the Catholics
      ambitiously claimed his alliance; 101 and the Pagans, who might
      be susceptible of shame or remorse, were deterred from the
      repetition of such unavailing cruelty. 102 Julian spared his
      life: but if the bishop of Arethusa had saved the infancy of
      Julian, 103 posterity will condemn the ingratitude, instead of
      praising the clemency, of the emperor.

      At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the Macedonian kings
      of Syria had consecrated to Apollo one of the most elegant places
      of devotion in the Pagan world. 104 A magnificent temple rose in
      honor of the god of light; and his colossal figure 105 almost
      filled the capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and
      gems, and adorned by the skill of the Grecian artists. The deity
      was represented in a bending attitude, with a golden cup in his
      hand, pouring out a libation on the earth; as if he supplicated
      the venerable mother to give to his arms the cold and beauteous
      Daphne: for the spot was ennobled by fiction; and the fancy of
      the Syrian poets had transported the amorous tale from the banks
      of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient rites of
      Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream of
      prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic
      oracle, flowed from the _Castalian_ fountain of Daphne. 106 In
      the adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege,
      107 which had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were
      celebrated at the expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty
      thousand pounds sterling was annually applied to the public
      pleasures. 108 The perpetual resort of pilgrims and spectators
      insensibly formed, in the neighborhood of the temple, the stately
      and populous village of Daphne, which emulated the splendor,
      without acquiring the title, of a provincial city. The temple and
      the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and
      cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles,
      and formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable
      shade. A thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every
      hill, preserved the verdure of the earth, and the temperature of
      the air; the senses were gratified with harmonious sounds and
      aromatic odors; and the peaceful grove was consecrated to health
      and joy, to luxury and love. The vigorous youth pursued, like
      Apollo, the object of his desires; and the blushing maid was
      warned, by the fate of Daphne, to shun the folly of unseasonable
      coyness. The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided the
      temptation of this sensual paradise: 109 where pleasure, assuming
      the character of religion, imperceptibly dissolved the firmness
      of manly virtue. But the groves of Daphne continued for many ages
      to enjoy the veneration of natives and strangers; the privileges
      of the holy ground were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding
      emperors; and every generation added new ornaments to the
      splendor of the temple. 110

      When Julian, on the day of the annual festival, hastened to adore
      the Apollo of Daphne, his devotion was raised to the highest
      pitch of eagerness and impatience. His lively imagination
      anticipated the grateful pomp of victims, of libations and of
      incense; a long procession of youths and virgins, clothed in
      white robes, the symbol of their innocence; and the tumultuous
      concourse of an innumerable people. But the zeal of Antioch was
      diverted, since the reign of Christianity, into a different
      channel. Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the
      tribes of a wealthy city to their tutelar deity the emperor
      complains that he found only a single goose, provided at the
      expense of a priest, the pale and solitary inhabitant of this
      decayed temple. 111 The altar was deserted, the oracle had been
      reduced to silence, and the holy ground was profaned by the
      introduction of Christian and funereal rites. After Babylas 112
      (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in the persecution of
      Decius) had rested near a century in his grave, his body, by the
      order of Cæsar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the
      grove of Daphne. A magnificent church was erected over his
      remains; a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the
      maintenance of the clergy, and for the burial of the Christians
      at Antioch, who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their
      bishop; and the priests of Apollo retired, with their affrighted
      and indignant votaries. As soon as another revolution seemed to
      restore the fortune of Paganism, the church of St. Babylas was
      demolished, and new buildings were added to the mouldering
      edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings. But
      the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his
      oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living
      Christians, who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud
      or enthusiasm. 113 The scene of infection was purified, according
      to the forms of ancient rituals; the bodies were decently
      removed; and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey
      the remains of St. Babylas to their former habitation within the
      walls of Antioch. The modest behavior which might have assuaged
      the jealousy of a hostile government was neglected, on this
      occasion, by the zeal of the Christians. The lofty car, that
      transported the relics of Babylas, was followed, and accompanied,
      and received, by an innumerable multitude; who chanted, with
      thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David the most expressive
      of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return of the
      saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the
      religion of the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his
      resentment. During the night which terminated this indiscreet
      procession, the temple of Daphne was in flames; the statue of
      Apollo was consumed; and the walls of the edifice were left a
      naked and awful monument of ruin. The Christians of Antioch
      asserted, with religious confidence, that the powerful
      intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven
      against the devoted roof: but as Julian was reduced to the
      alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose,
      without hesitation, without evidence, but with some color of
      probability, to impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the
      Galilæans. 114 Their offence, had it been sufficiently proved,
      might have justified the retaliation, which was immediately
      executed by the order of Julian, of shutting the doors, and
      confiscating the wealth, of the cathedral of Antioch. To discover
      the criminals who were guilty of the tumult, of the fire, or of
      secreting the riches of the church, several of the ecclesiastics
      were tortured; 115 and a Presbyter, of the name of Theodoret, was
      beheaded by the sentence of the Count of the East. But this hasty
      act was blamed by the emperor; who lamented, with real or
      affected concern, that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would
      tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution. 116

      Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.—Part V.


      The zeal of the ministers of Julian was instantly checked by the
      frown of their sovereign; but when the father of his country
      declares himself the leader of a faction, the license of popular
      fury cannot easily be restrained, nor consistently punished.
      Julian, in a public composition, applauds the devotion and
      loyalty of the holy cities of Syria, whose pious inhabitants had
      destroyed, at the first signal, the sepulchres of the Galilæans;
      and faintly complains, that they had revenged the injuries of the
      gods with less moderation than he should have recommended. 117
      This imperfect and reluctant confession may appear to confirm the
      ecclesiastical narratives; that in the cities of Gaza, Ascalon,
      Cæsarea, Heliopolis, &c., the Pagans abused, without prudence or
      remorse, the moment of their prosperity. That the unhappy objects
      of their cruelty were released from torture only by death; and as
      their mangled bodies were dragged through the streets, they were
      pierced (such was the universal rage) by the spits of cooks, and
      the distaffs of enraged women; and that the entrails of Christian
      priests and virgins, after they had been tasted by those bloody
      fanatics, were mixed with barley, and contemptuously thrown to
      the unclean animals of the city. 118 Such scenes of religious
      madness exhibit the most contemptible and odious picture of human
      nature; but the massacre of Alexandria attracts still more
      attention, from the certainty of the fact, the rank of the
      victims, and the splendor of the capital of Egypt.

      George, 119 from his parents or his education, surnamed the
      Cappadocian, was born at Epiphania in Cilicia, in a fuller’s
      shop. From this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by
      the talents of a parasite; and the patrons, whom he assiduously
      flattered, procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative
      commission, or contract, to supply the army with bacon. His
      employment was mean; he rendered it infamous. He accumulated
      wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption; but his
      malversations were so notorious, that George was compelled to
      escape from the pursuits of justice. After this disgrace, in
      which he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his
      honor, he embraced, with real or affected zeal, the profession of
      Arianism. From the love, or the ostentation, of learning, he
      collected a valuable library of history rhetoric, philosophy, and
      theology, 120 and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted
      George of Cappadocia to the throne of Athanasius. The entrance of
      the new archbishop was that of a Barbarian conqueror; and each
      moment of his reign was polluted by cruelty and avarice. The
      Catholics of Alexandria and Egypt were abandoned to a tyrant,
      qualified, by nature and education, to exercise the office of
      persecution; but he oppressed with an impartial hand the various
      inhabitants of his extensive diocese. The primate of Egypt
      assumed the pomp and insolence of his lofty station; but he still
      betrayed the vices of his base and servile extraction. The
      merchants of Alexandria were impoverished by the unjust, and
      almost universal, monopoly, which he acquired, of nitre, salt,
      paper, funerals, &c.: and the spiritual father of a great people
      condescended to practise the vile and pernicious arts of an
      informer. The Alexandrians could never forget, nor forgive, the
      tax, which he suggested, on all the houses of the city; under an
      obsolete claim, that the royal founder had conveyed to his
      successors, the Ptolemies and the Cæsars, the perpetual property
      of the soil. The Pagans, who had been flattered with the hopes of
      freedom and toleration, excited his devout avarice; and the rich
      temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the
      haughty prince, who exclaimed, in a loud and threatening tone,
      “How long will these sepulchres be permitted to stand?” Under the
      reign of Constantius, he was expelled by the fury, or rather by
      the justice, of the people; and it was not without a violent
      struggle, that the civil and military powers of the state could
      restore his authority, and gratify his revenge. The messenger who
      proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian, announced the
      downfall of the archbishop. George, with two of his obsequious
      ministers, Count Diodorus, and Dracontius, master of the mint
      were ignominiously dragged in chains to the public prison. At the
      end of twenty-four days, the prison was forced open by the rage
      of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the tedious forms of
      judicial proceedings. The enemies of gods and men expired under
      their cruel insults; the lifeless bodies of the archbishop and
      his associates were carried in triumph through the streets on the
      back of a camel; 12011 and the inactivity of the Athanasian party
      121 was esteemed a shining example of evangelical patience. The
      remains of these guilty wretches were thrown into the sea; and
      the popular leaders of the tumult declared their resolution to
      disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to intercept the
      future honors of these _martyrs_, who had been punished, like
      their predecessors, by the enemies of their religion. 122 The
      fears of the Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffectual.
      The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of
      his life. The rival of Athanasius was dear and sacred to the
      Arians, and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced
      his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church. 123 The odious
      stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place,
      assumed the mask of a martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero; 124
      and the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed 125
      into the renowned St. George of England, the patron of arms, of
      chivalry, and of the garter. 126

      Europe, and especially in England, proceeded from the Crusades.]

      About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of
      Alexandria, he received intelligence from Edessa, that the proud
      and wealthy faction of the Arians had insulted the weakness of
      the Valentinians, and committed such disorders as ought not to be
      suffered with impunity in a well-regulated state. Without
      expecting the slow forms of justice, the exasperated prince
      directed his mandate to the magistrates of Edessa, 127 by which
      he confiscated the whole property of the church: the money was
      distributed among the soldiers; the lands were added to the
      domain; and this act of oppression was aggravated by the most
      ungenerous irony. “I show myself,” says Julian, “the true friend
      of the Galilæans. Their _admirable_ law has promised the kingdom
      of heaven to the poor; and they will advance with more diligence
      in the paths of virtue and salvation, when they are relieved by
      my assistance from the load of temporal possessions. Take care,”
      pursued the monarch, in a more serious tone, “take care how you
      provoke my patience and humanity. If these disorders continue, I
      will revenge on the magistrates the crimes of the people; and you
      will have reason to dread, not only confiscation and exile, but
      fire and the sword.” The tumults of Alexandria were doubtless of
      a more bloody and dangerous nature: but a Christian bishop had
      fallen by the hands of the Pagans; and the public epistle of
      Julian affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of his
      administration. His reproaches to the citizens of Alexandria are
      mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness; and he
      laments, that, on this occasion, they should have departed from
      the gentle and generous manners which attested their Grecian
      extraction. He gravely censures the offence which they had
      committed against the laws of justice and humanity; but he
      recapitulates, with visible complacency, the intolerable
      provocations which they had so long endured from the impious
      tyranny of George of Cappadocia. Julian admits the principle,
      that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence
      of the people; yet, in consideration of their founder Alexander,
      and of Serapis their tutelar deity, he grants a free and gracious
      pardon to the guilty city, for which he again feels the affection
      of a brother. 128

      After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided, Athanasius, amidst
      the public acclamations, seated himself on the throne from whence
      his unworthy competitor had been precipitated: and as the zeal of
      the archbishop was tempered with discretion, the exercise of his
      authority tended not to inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of
      the people. His pastoral labors were not confined to the narrow
      limits of Egypt. The state of the Christian world was present to
      his active and capacious mind; and the age, the merit, the
      reputation of Athanasius, enabled him to assume, in a moment of
      danger, the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator. 129 Three years
      were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the
      West had ignorantly, or reluctantly, subscribed the Confession of
      Rimini. They repented, they believed, but they dreaded the
      unseasonable rigor of their orthodox brethren; and if their pride
      was stronger than their faith, they might throw themselves into
      the arms of the Arians, to escape the indignity of a public
      penance, which must degrade them to the condition of obscure
      laymen. At the same time the domestic differences concerning the
      union and distinction of the divine persons, were agitated with
      some heat among the Catholic doctors; and the progress of this
      metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting
      division of the Greek and Latin churches. By the wisdom of a
      select synod, to which the name and presence of Athanasius gave
      the authority of a general council, the bishops, who had unwarily
      deviated into error, were admitted to the communion of the
      church, on the easy condition of subscribing the Nicene Creed;
      without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault, or any
      minute definition of their scholastic opinions. The advice of the
      primate of Egypt had already prepared the clergy of Gaul and
      Spain, of Italy and Greece, for the reception of this salutary
      measure; and, notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent
      spirits, 130 the fear of the common enemy promoted the peace and
      harmony of the Christians. 131

      The skill and diligence of the primate of Egypt had improved the
      season of tranquillity, before it was interrupted by the hostile
      edicts of the emperor. 132 Julian, who despised the Christians,
      honored Athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred. For his
      sake alone, he introduced an arbitrary distinction, repugnant at
      least to the spirit of his former declarations. He maintained,
      that the Galilæans, whom he had recalled from exile, were not
      restored, by that general indulgence, to the possession of their
      respective churches; and he expressed his astonishment, that a
      criminal, who had been repeatedly condemned by the judgment of
      the emperors, should dare to insult the majesty of the laws, and
      insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria, without
      expecting the orders of his sovereign. As a punishment for the
      imaginary offence, he again banished Athanasius from the city;
      and he was pleased to suppose, that this act of justice would be
      highly agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressing
      solicitations of the people soon convinced him, that the majority
      of the Alexandrians were Christians; and that the greatest part
      of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of their
      oppressed primate. But the knowledge of their sentiments, instead
      of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to
      all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the
      multitude rendered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed
      by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a
      daring and popular leader; and the language of his resentment
      discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and
      abilities of Athanasius. The execution of the sentence was still
      delayed, by the caution or negligence of Ecdicius, præfect of
      Egypt, who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe
      reprimand. “Though you neglect,” says Julian, “to write to me on
      any other subject, at least it is your duty to inform me of your
      conduct towards Athanasius, the enemy of the gods. My intentions
      have been long since communicated to you. I swear by the great
      Serapis, that unless, on the calends of December, Athanasius has
      departed from Alexandria, nay, from Egypt, the officers of your
      government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of gold. You
      know my temper: I am slow to condemn, but I am still slower to
      forgive.” This epistle was enforced by a short postscript,
      written with the emperor’s own hand. “The contempt that is shown
      for all the gods fills me with grief and indignation. There is
      nothing that I should see, nothing that I should hear, with more
      pleasure, than the expulsion of Athanasius from all Egypt. The
      abominable wretch! Under my reign, the baptism of several Grecian
      ladies of the highest rank has been the effect of his
      persecutions.” 133 The death of Athanasius was not _expressly_
      commanded; but the præfect of Egypt understood that it was safer
      for him to exceed, than to neglect, the orders of an irritated
      master. The archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of
      the Desert; eluded, with his usual dexterity, the snares of the
      enemy; and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince, who, in
      words of formidable import, had declared his wish that the whole
      venom of the Galilæan school were contained in the single person
      of Athanasius. 134 13411

      I have endeavored faithfully to represent the artful system by
      which Julian proposed to obtain the effects, without incurring
      the guilt, or reproach, of persecution. But if the deadly spirit
      of fanaticism perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous
      prince, it must, at the same time, be confessed that the _real_
      sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by human
      passions and religious enthusiasm. The meekness and resignation
      which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel,
      was the object of the applause, rather than of the imitation of
      their successors. The Christians, who had now possessed above
      forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the
      empire, had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity, 135 and
      the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to
      reign over the earth. As soon as the enmity of Julian deprived
      the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the
      favor of Constantine, they complained of the most cruel
      oppression; and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was
      a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party. 136 The
      acts of violence, which were no longer countenanced by the
      magistrates, were still committed by the zeal of the people. At
      Pessinus, the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the
      presence of the emperor; and in the city of Cæsarea in
      Cappadocia, the temple of Fortune, the sole place of worship
      which had been left to the Pagans, was destroyed by the rage of a
      popular tumult. On these occasions, a prince, who felt for the
      honor of the gods, was not disposed to interrupt the course of
      justice; and his mind was still more deeply exasperated, when he
      found that the fanatics, who had deserved and suffered the
      punishment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honors of
      martyrdom. 137 The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of
      the hostile designs of their sovereign; and, to their jealous
      apprehension, every circumstance of his government might afford
      some grounds of discontent and suspicion. In the ordinary
      administration of the laws, the Christians, who formed so large a
      part of the people, must frequently be condemned: but their
      indulgent brethren, without examining the merits of the cause,
      presumed their innocence, allowed their claims, and imputed the
      severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious
      persecution. 138 These present hardships, intolerable as they
      might appear, were represented as a slight prelude of the
      impending calamities. The Christians considered Julian as a cruel
      and crafty tyrant; who suspended the execution of his revenge
      till he should return victorious from the Persian war. They
      expected, that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign
      enemies of Rome, he would lay aside the irksome mask of
      dissimulation; that the amphitheatre would stream with the blood
      of hermits and bishops; and that the Christians who still
      persevered in the profession of the faith, would be deprived of
      the common benefits of nature and society. 139 Every calumny 140
      that could wound the reputation of the Apostate, was credulously
      embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their
      indiscreet clamors provoked the temper of a sovereign, whom it
      was their duty to respect, and their interest to flatter.

      They still protested, that prayers and tears were their only
      weapons against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to
      the justice of offended Heaven. But they insinuated, with sullen
      resolution, that their submission was no longer the effect of
      weakness; and that, in the imperfect state of human virtue, the
      patience, which is founded on principle, may be exhausted by
      persecution. It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of
      Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity; but
      if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church,
      we shall be convinced, that before the emperor could have
      extinguished the religion of Christ, he must have involved his
      country in the horrors of a civil war. 141

     Julian.—Election Of Jovian.—He Saves The Roman Army By A

      The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name of
      the Cæsars, 1 is one of the most agreeable and instructive
      productions of ancient wit. 2 During the freedom and equality of
      the days of the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast for the
      deities of Olympus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate,
      and for the Roman princes, who had reigned over his martial
      people, and the vanquished nations of the earth. The immortals
      were placed in just order on their thrones of state, and the
      table of the Cæsars was spread below the Moon in the upper region
      of the air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced the society of
      gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inexorable Nemesis,
      into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the Cæsars successively
      advanced to their seats; and as they passed, the vices, the
      defects, the blemishes of their respective characters, were
      maliciously noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who
      disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a
      Bacchanal. 3 As soon as the feast was ended, the voice of Mercury
      proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a celestial crown should be
      the reward of superior merit. Julius Cæsar, Augustus, Trajan, and
      Marcus Antoninus, were selected as the most illustrious
      candidates; the effeminate Constantine 4 was not excluded from
      this honorable competition, and the great Alexander was invited
      to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the
      candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits;
      but, in the judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus
      pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his
      haughty rivals. When the judges of this awful contest proceeded
      to examine the heart, and to scrutinize the springs of action,
      the superiority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still more
      decisive and conspicuous. 5 Alexander and Cæsar, Augustus,
      Trajan, and Constantine, acknowledged, with a blush, that fame,
      or power, or pleasure had been the important object of _their_
      labors: but the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love,
      a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of
      philosophy; and who, in a state of human imperfection, had
      aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity. The value
      of this agreeable composition (the Cæsars of Julian) is enhanced
      by the rank of the author. A prince, who delineates, with
      freedom, the vices and virtues of his predecessors, subscribes,
      in every line, the censure or approbation of his own conduct.

      edition of Julian’s works. The French version of the learned
      Ezekiel Spanheim (Paris, 1683) is coarse, languid, and correct;
      and his notes, proofs, illustrations, &c., are piled on each
      other till they form a mass of 557 close-printed quarto pages.
      The Abbé’ de la Bleterie (Vie de Jovien, tom. i. p. 241-393) has
      more happily expressed the spirit, as well as the sense, of the
      original, which he illustrates with some concise and curious
      notes.]

      tragedy; and the Latin _satires_, (from _Satura_,) a
      _miscellaneous_ composition, either in prose or verse. But the
      Cæsars of Julian are of such an original cast, that the critic is
      perplexed to which class he should ascribe them. * Note: See also
      Casaubon de Satira, with Rambach’s observations.—M.]

      3 (return) [ This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in
      the sixth eclogue of Virgil.]

      4 (return) [ Every impartial reader must perceive and condemn the
      partiality of Julian against his uncle Constantine, and the
      Christian religion. On this occasion, the interpreters are
      compelled, by a most sacred interest, to renounce their
      allegiance, and to desert the cause of their author.]

      5 (return) [ Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a
      Roman. But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher,
      he was sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to
      Socrates than to Alexander, (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.)]

      In the cool moments of reflection, Julian preferred the useful
      and benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was
      inflamed by the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal
      ardor, the esteem of the wise, and the applause of the multitude.
      In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy
      the most active vigor, the emperor who was instructed by the
      experience, and animated by the success, of the German war,
      resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and
      memorable achievement. The ambassadors of the East, from the
      continent of India, and the Isle of Ceylon, 6 had respectfully
      saluted the Roman purple. 7 The nations of the West esteemed and
      dreaded the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He
      despised the trophies of a Gothic victory, and was satisfied that
      the rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from
      any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of
      his name, and the additional fortifications with which he
      strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers. The successor
      of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy
      of his arms; and he resolved, by the final conquest of Persia, to
      chastise the naughty nation which had so long resisted and
      insulted the majesty of Rome. 9 As soon as the Persian monarch
      was informed that the throne of Constantius was filled by a
      prince of a very different character, he condescended to make
      some artful, or perhaps sincere, overtures towards a negotiation
      of peace. But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness
      of Julian; who sternly declared, that he would never consent to
      hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the
      cities of Mesopotamia; and who added, with a smile of contempt,
      that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as he himself had
      determined to visit speedily the court of Persia. The impatience
      of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations.
      The generals were named; and Julian, marching from Constantinople
      through the provinces of Asia Minor, arrived at Antioch about
      eight months after the death of his predecessor. His ardent
      desire to march into the heart of Persia, was checked by the
      indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire; by his
      zeal to revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his
      wisest friends; who represented the necessity of allowing the
      salutary interval of winter quarters, to restore the exhausted
      strength of the legions of Gaul, and the discipline and spirit of
      the Eastern troops. Julian was persuaded to fix, till the ensuing
      spring, his residence at Antioch, among a people maliciously
      disposed to deride the haste, and to censure the delays, of their
      sovereign. 10

      This island, to which the names of Taprobana, Serendib, and

      the seas and lands to the east of Cape Comorin were known to the
      Romans. 1. Under the reign of Claudius, a freedman, who farmed
      the customs of the Red Sea, was accidentally driven by the winds
      upon this strange and undiscovered coast: he conversed six months
      with the natives; and the king of Ceylon, who heard, for the
      first time, of the power and justice of Rome, was persuaded to
      send an embassy to the emperor. (Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 24.) 2. The
      geographers (and even Ptolemy) have magnified, above fifteen
      times, the real size of this new world, which they extended as
      far as the equator, and the neighborhood of China. * Note: The
      name of Diva gens or Divorum regio, according to the probable
      conjecture of M. Letronne, (Trois Mém. Acad. p. 127,) was applied
      by the ancients to the whole eastern coast of the Indian
      Peninsula, from Ceylon to the Canges. The name may be traced in
      Devipatnam, Devidan, Devicotta, Divinelly, the point of Divy.——M.

      Mesopotamia or Assyria, (Cæsares, p. 324.)]

      If Julian had flattered himself, that his personal connection
      with the capital of the East would be productive of mutual
      satisfaction to the prince and people, he made a very false
      estimate of his own character, and of the manners of Antioch. 11
      The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most
      intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence; and the
      lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the
      hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law,
      pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and
      furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch.
      The arts of luxury were honored; the serious and manly virtues
      were the subject of ridicule; and the contempt for female modesty
      and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the
      capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the taste, or
      rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were
      procured from the adjacent cities; 12 a considerable share of the
      revenue was devoted to the public amusements; and the
      magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was
      considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch. The
      rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory, and was
      insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the delicacy of his
      subjects; and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate, nor
      admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained, and
      sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated, by
      ancient custom, to the honor of the gods, were the only occasions
      in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity; and those
      festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch
      could reject the allurements of pleasure. The majority of the
      people supported the glory of the Christian name, which had been
      first invented by their ancestors: 13 they contended themselves
      with disobeying the moral precepts, but they were scrupulously
      attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion. The
      church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism; but the
      Arians and the Athanasians, the followers of Meletius and those
      of Paulinus, 14 were actuated by the same pious hatred of their
      common adversary.

      Tillemont, Mém. Eccles. tom. iii. p. 803 of the quarto edition,
      (Paris, 1701, &c,) which henceforward I shall quote.]

      The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of
      an apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged
      the affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St.
      Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian.
      His subjects complained, with superstitious indignation, that
      famine had pursued the emperor’s steps from Constantinople to
      Antioch; and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by
      the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress. The inclemency
      of the season had affected the harvests of Syria; and the price
      of bread, 15 in the markets of Antioch, had naturally risen in
      proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair and reasonable
      proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly.
      In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is
      claimed by one party as his exclusive property, is used by
      another as a lucrative object of trade, and is required by a
      third for the daily and necessary support of life, all the
      profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of
      the defenceless customers. The hardships of their situation were
      exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety;
      and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the
      appearances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens of Antioch
      complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian publicly
      declared, that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular
      supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknowledged, that it was
      the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his
      people. With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very
      dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the
      value of corn. He enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should
      be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most
      plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his
      laws, he sent into the market four hundred and twenty-two
      thousand _modii_, or measures, which were drawn by his order from
      the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt. The
      consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The
      Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the
      proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from the city the
      accustomed supply; and the small quantities that appeared in the
      market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price.
      Julian still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the
      complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and
      convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy, though not
      the cruelty, of his brother Gallus. 16 The remonstrances of the
      municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.
      He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of
      Antioch who possessed lands, or were concerned in trade, had
      themselves contributed to the calamities of their country; and he
      imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed, to the
      sense, not of public duty, but of private interest. The whole
      body, consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy
      citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to the
      prison; and though they were permitted, before the close of
      evening, to return to their respective houses, 17 the emperor
      himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily
      granted. The same grievances were still the subject of the same
      complaints, which were industriously circulated by the wit and
      levity of the Syrian Greeks. During the licentious days of the
      Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent
      songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the personal
      conduct, and even the _beard_, of the emperor; the spirit of
      Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates, and
      the applause of the multitude. 18 The disciple of Socrates was
      too deeply affected by these popular insults; but the monarch,
      endowed with a quick sensibility, and possessed of absolute
      power, refused his passions the gratification of revenge. A
      tyrant might have proscribed, without distinction, the lives and
      fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and the unwarlike Syrians
      must have patiently submitted to the lust, the rapaciousness and
      the cruelty, of the faithful legions of Gaul. A milder sentence
      might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and
      privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the subjects, of Julian,
      would have applauded an act of justice, which asserted the
      dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic. 19 But instead
      of abusing, or exerting, the authority of the state, to revenge
      his personal injuries, Julian contented himself with an
      inoffensive mode of retaliation, which it would be in the power
      of few princes to employ. He had been insulted by satires and
      libels; in his turn, he composed, under the title of the _Enemy
      of the Beard_, an ironical confession of his own faults, and a
      severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of
      Antioch. This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the
      gates of the palace; and the Misopogon 20 still remains a
      singular monument of the resentment, the wit, the humanity, and
      the indiscretion of Julian. Though he affected to laugh, he could
      not forgive. 21 His contempt was expressed, and his revenge might
      be gratified, by the nomination of a governor 22 worthy only of
      such subjects; and the emperor, forever renouncing the ungrateful
      city, proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at
      Tarsus in Cilicia. 23

      Yet Antioch possessed one citizen, whose genius and virtues might
      atone, in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his
      country. The sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the
      East; he publicly professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation
      at Nice, Nicomedia, Constantinople, Athens, and, during the
      remainder of his life, at Antioch. His school was assiduously
      frequented by the Grecian youth; his disciples, who sometimes
      exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their incomparable
      master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him from
      one city to another, confirmed the favorable opinion which
      Libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit. The
      preceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance,
      that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary: the
      curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed: he
      secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist, and
      gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of his style, the
      most laborious of his domestic pupils. 24 When Julian ascended
      the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the
      Syrian sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the
      Grecian purity of taste, of manners, and of religion. The
      emperor’s prepossession was increased and justified by the
      discreet pride of his favorite. Instead of pressing, with the
      foremost of the crowd, into the palace of Constantinople,
      Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch; withdrew from
      court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference;
      required a formal invitation for each visit; and taught his
      sovereign an important lesson, that he might command the
      obedience of a subject, but that he must deserve the attachment
      of a friend. The sophists of every age, despising, or affecting
      to despise, the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune, 25
      reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind, with
      which they themselves are so plentifully endowed. Julian might
      disdain the acclamations of a venal court, who adored the
      Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered by the praise, the
      admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent
      philosopher, who refused his favors, loved his person, celebrated
      his fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of
      Libanius still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and
      idle compositions of an orator, who cultivated the science of
      words; the productions of a recluse student, whose mind,
      regardless of his contemporaries, was incessantly fixed on the
      Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth. Yet the sophist of
      Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation; he
      entertained a various and elaborate correspondence; 26 he praised
      the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuse of
      public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded the cause of
      Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius. It
      is the common calamity of old age, 27 to lose whatever might have
      rendered it desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar
      misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences, to which
      he had consecrated his genius. The friend of Julian was an
      indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity; and his
      bigotry, which darkened the prospect of the visible world, did
      not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and
      happiness. 28

      Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.—Part II.


      The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in
      the beginning of the spring; and he dismissed, with contempt and
      reproach, the senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor
      beyond the limits of their own territory, to which he was
      resolved never to return. After a laborious march of two days, 29
      he halted on the third at Beræa, or Aleppo, where he had the
      mortification of finding a senate almost entirely Christian; who
      received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the
      eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism. The son of one of the
      most illustrious citizens of Beræa, who had embraced, either from
      interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was
      disinherited by his angry parent. The father and the son were
      invited to the Imperial table. Julian, placing himself between
      them, attempted, without success, to inculcate the lesson and
      example of toleration; supported, with affected calmness, the
      indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian, who seemed to forget the
      sentiments of nature, and the duty of a subject; and at length,
      turning towards the afflicted youth, “Since you have lost a
      father,” said he, “for my sake, it is incumbent on me to supply
      his place.” 30 The emperor was received in a manner much more
      agreeable to his wishes at Batnæ, 3011 a small town pleasantly
      seated in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles from the city
      of Hierapolis. The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently
      prepared by the inhabitants of Batnæ, who seemed attached to the
      worship of their tutelar deities, Apollo and Jupiter; but the
      serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their
      applause; and he too clearly discerned, that the smoke which
      arose from their altars was the incense of flattery, rather than
      of devotion. The ancient and magnificent temple which had
      sanctified, for so many ages, the city of Hierapolis, 31 no
      longer subsisted; and the consecrated wealth, which afforded a
      liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests, might
      hasten its downfall. Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of
      embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose religious firmness
      had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of
      Constantius and Gallus, as often as those princes lodged at his
      house, in their passage through Hierapolis. In the hurry of
      military preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar
      correspondence, the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively
      and uniform. He had now undertaken an important and difficult
      war; and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more
      attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages,
      from which, according to the rules of divination, any knowledge
      of futurity could be derived. 32 He informed Libanius of his
      progress as far as Hierapolis, by an elegant epistle, 33 which
      displays the facility of his genius, and his tender friendship
      for the sophist of Antioch.

      Hierapolis, 3311 situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates, 34
      had been appointed for the general rendezvous of the Roman
      troops, who immediately passed the great river on a bridge of
      boats, which was previously constructed. 35 If the inclinations
      of Julian had been similar to those of his predecessor, he might
      have wasted the active and important season of the year in the
      circus of Samosata or in the churches of Edessa. But as the
      warlike emperor, instead of Constantius, had chosen Alexander for
      his model, he advanced without delay to Carrhæ, 36 a very ancient
      city of Mesopotamia, at the distance of fourscore miles from
      Hierapolis. The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of
      Julian; but the halt of a few days was principally employed in
      completing the immense preparations of the Persian war. The
      secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast;
      but as Carrhæ is the point of separation of the two great roads,
      he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack
      the dominions of Sapor on the side of the Tigris, or on that of
      the Euphrates. The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand
      men, under the command of his kinsman Procopius, and of
      Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They were ordered to
      direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the frontier
      from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they attempted
      the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were left
      to the discretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that
      after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media
      and Adiabene, they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at
      the same time that he himself, advancing with equal steps along
      the banks of the Euphrates, should besiege the capital of the
      Persian monarchy. The success of this well-concerted plan
      depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and ready
      assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the
      safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four
      thousand horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of
      the Romans. 37 But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, 38 king of
      Armenia, had degenerated still more shamefully than his father
      Chosroes, from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates; and as
      the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger
      and glory, he could disguise his timid indolence by the more
      decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He expressed a pious
      attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose hands he had
      received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the præfect
      Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as
      the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of
      a Barbarian king. 39 Tiranus professed the Christian religion; he
      reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by
      every principle of conscience and interest, from contributing to
      the victory, which would consummate the ruin of the church. The
      alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of
      Julian, who treated the king of Armenia as _his_ slave, and as
      the enemy of the gods. The haughty and threatening style of the
      Imperial mandates 40 awakened the secret indignation of a prince,
      who, in the humiliating state of dependence, was still conscious
      of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords of the East,
      and the rivals of the Roman power. 4011

      twenty-five years before, in 337. The intermediate changes in
      Armenia, and the character of this Arsaces, the son of Diran, are
      traced by M. St. Martin, at considerable length, in his
      supplement to Le Beau, ii. 208-242. As long as his Grecian queen
      Olympias maintained her influence, Arsaces was faithful to the
      Roman and _Christian_ alliance. On the accession of Julian, the
      same influence made his fidelity to waver; but Olympias having
      been poisoned in the sacramental bread by the agency of
      Pharandcem, the former wife of Arsaces, another change took place
      in Armenian politics unfavorable to the Christian interest. The
      patriarch Narses retired from the impious court to a safe
      seclusion. Yet Pharandsem was equally hostile to the Persian
      influence, and Arsaces began to support with vigor the cause of
      Julian. He made an inroad into the Persian dominions with a body
      of Rans and Alans as auxiliaries; wasted Aderbidgan and Sapor,
      who had been defeated near Tauriz, was engaged in making head
      against his troops in Persarmenia, at the time of the death of

      rests on the Armenian historians, Faustos of Byzantium, and
      Mezrob the biographer of the Partriarch Narses. In the history of

      The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to
      deceive the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor. The
      legions appeared to direct their march towards Nisibis and the
      Tigris. On a sudden they wheeled to the right; traversed the
      level and naked plain of Carrhæ; and reached, on the third day,
      the banks of the Euphrates, where the strong town of Nicephorium,
      or Callinicum, had been founded by the Macedonian kings. From
      thence the emperor pursued his march, above ninety miles, along
      the winding stream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one
      month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered the towers
      of Circesium, 4012 the extreme limit of the Roman dominions. The
      army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the Cæsars had ever
      led against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective
      and well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and
      infantry, of Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the
      different provinces; and a just preëminence of loyalty and valor
      was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who guarded the throne and person
      of their beloved prince. A formidable body of Scythian
      auxiliaries had been transported from another climate, and almost
      from another world, to invade a distant country, of whose name
      and situation they were ignorant. The love of rapine and war
      allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens, or
      roving Arabs, whose service Julian had commanded, while he
      sternly refused the payment of the accustomed subsidies. The
      broad channel of the Euphrates 41 was crowded by a fleet of
      eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the motions, and to
      satisfy the wants, of the Roman army. The military strength of
      the fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys; and these were
      accompanied by an equal number of flat-bottomed boats, which
      might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary
      bridges. The rest of the ships, partly constructed of timber, and
      partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost
      inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and
      provisions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very
      large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the
      soldiers, but he prohibited the indulgence of wine; and
      rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that
      attempted to follow the rear of the army. The River Chaboras
      falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; 42 and as soon as the
      trumpet gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the little
      stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom
      of ancient discipline required a military oration; and Julian
      embraced every opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He
      animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of
      the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors.
      He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence
      of the Persians; and he exhorted them to imitate his firm
      resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation, or to
      devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of
      Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty
      pieces of silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras
      was instantly cut away, to convince the troops that they must
      place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms. Yet the
      prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier,
      perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs. A
      detachment of four thousand men was left at Circesium, which
      completed, to the number of ten thousand, the regular garrison of
      that important fortress. 43

      From the moment that the Romans entered the enemy’s country, 44
      the country of an active and artful enemy, the order of march was
      disposed in three columns. 45 The strength of the infantry, and
      consequently of the whole army was placed in the centre, under
      the peculiar command of their master-general Victor. On the
      right, the brave Nevitta led a column of several legions along
      the banks of the Euphrates, and almost always in sight of the
      fleet. The left flank of the army was protected by the column of
      cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinthæus were appointed generals of the
      horse; and the singular adventures of Hormisdas 46 are not
      undeserving of our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royal
      race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of
      Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the
      great Constantine. Hormisdas at first excited the compassion, and
      at length acquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valor and
      fidelity raised him to the military honors of the Roman service;
      and though a Christian, he might indulge the secret satisfaction
      of convincing his ungrateful country, that an oppressed subject
      may prove the most dangerous enemy. Such was the disposition of
      the three principal columns. The front and flanks of the army
      were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment of fifteen
      hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed the
      most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any
      hostile approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene,
      conducted the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage securely
      proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a
      motive either of use or ostentation, were formed in such open
      order, that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles.
      The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column;
      but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a
      monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light cavalry,
      to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence could
      animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which
      they traversed from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of
      Assyria, may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a
      dry and barren waste, which could never be improved by the most
      powerful arts of human industry. Julian marched over the same
      ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by
      the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and which is described by one
      of the companions of his expedition, the sage and heroic
      Xenophon. 47 “The country was a plain throughout, as even as the
      sea, and full of wormwood; and if any other kind of shrubs or
      reeds grew there, they had all an aromatic smell, but no trees
      could be seen. Bustards and ostriches, antelopes and wild asses,
      48 appeared to be the only inhabitants of the desert; and the
      fatigues of the march were alleviated by the amusements of the
      chase.” The loose sand of the desert was frequently raised by the
      wind into clouds of dust; and a great number of the soldiers of
      Julian, with their tents, were suddenly thrown to the ground by
      the violence of an unexpected hurricane.

      The sandy plains of Mesopotamia were abandoned to the antelopes
      and wild asses of the desert; but a variety of populous towns and
      villages were pleasantly situated on the banks of the Euphrates,
      and in the islands which are occasionally formed by that river.
      The city of Annah, or Anatho, 49 the actual residence of an
      Arabian emir, is composed of two long streets, which enclose,
      within a natural fortification, a small island in the midst, and
      two fruitful spots on either side, of the Euphrates. The warlike
      inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition to stop the march of a
      Roman emperor; till they were diverted from such fatal
      presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas, and the
      approaching terrors of the fleet and army. They implored, and
      experienced, the clemency of Julian, who transplanted the people
      to an advantageous settlement, near Chalcis in Syria, and
      admitted Pusæus, the governor, to an honorable rank in his
      service and friendship. But the impregnable fortress of Thilutha
      could scorn the menace of a siege; and the emperor was obliged to
      content himself with an insulting promise, that, when he had
      subdued the interior provinces of Persia, Thilutha would no
      longer refuse to grace the triumph of the emperor. The
      inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist, and unwilling to
      yield, fled with precipitation; and their houses, filled with
      spoil and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Julian,
      who massacred, without remorse and without punishment, some
      defenceless women. During the march, the Surenas, 4911 or Persian
      general, and Malek Rodosaces, the renowned emir of the tribe of
      Gassan, 50 incessantly hovered round the army; every straggler
      was intercepted; every detachment was attacked; and the valiant
      Hormisdas escaped with some difficulty from their hands. But the
      Barbarians were finally repulsed; the country became every day
      less favorable to the operations of cavalry; and when the Romans
      arrived at Macepracta, they perceived the ruins of the wall,
      which had been constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria, to
      secure their dominions from the incursions of the Medes. These
      preliminaries of the expedition of Julian appear to have employed
      about fifteen days; and we may compute near three hundred miles
      from the fortress of Circesium to the wall of Macepracta. 51

      The fertile province of Assyria, 52 which stretched beyond the
      Tigris, as far as the mountains of Media, 53 extended about four
      hundred miles from the ancient wall of Macepracta, to the
      territory of Basra, where the united streams of the Euphrates and
      Tigris discharge themselves into the Persian Gulf. 54 The whole
      country might have claimed the peculiar name of Mesopotamia; as
      the two rivers, which are never more distant than fifty,
      approach, between Bagdad and Babylon, within twenty-five miles,
      of each other. A multitude of artificial canals, dug without much
      labor in a soft and yielding soil connected the rivers, and
      intersected the plain of Assyria. The uses of these artificial
      canals were various and important. They served to discharge the
      superfluous waters from one river into the other, at the season
      of their respective inundations. Subdividing themselves into
      smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed the dry lands, and
      supplied the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the intercourse
      of peace and commerce; and, as the dams could be speedily broke
      down, they armed the despair of the Assyrians with the means of
      opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army. To
      the soil and climate of Assyria, nature had denied some of her
      choicest gifts, the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree; 5411 but
      the food which supports the life of man, and particularly wheat
      and barley, were produced with inexhaustible fertility; and the
      husbandman, who committed his seed to the earth, was frequently
      rewarded with an increase of two, or even of three, hundred. The
      face of the country was interspersed with groves of innumerable
      palm-trees; 55 and the diligent natives celebrated, either in
      verse or prose, the three hundred and sixty uses to which the
      trunk, the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit, were
      skilfully applied. Several manufactures, especially those of
      leather and linen, employed the industry of a numerous people,
      and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade; which appears,
      however, to have been conducted by the hands of strangers.
      Babylon had been converted into a royal park; but near the ruins
      of the ancient capital, new cities had successively arisen, and
      the populousness of the country was displayed in the multitude of
      towns and villages, which were built of bricks dried in the sun,
      and strongly cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar
      production of the Babylonian soil. While the successors of Cyrus
      reigned over Asia, the province of Syria alone maintained, during
      a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and
      household of the Great King. Four considerable villages were
      assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred
      stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were constantly kept, at
      the expense of the country, for the royal stables; and as the
      daily tribute, which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one
      English bushe of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of
      Assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling. 56

      Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.—Part III.


      The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of
      war; and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the
      acts of rapine and cruelty which had been committed by their
      haughty master in the Roman provinces. The trembling Assyrians
      summoned the rivers to their assistance; and completed, with
      their own hands, the ruin of their country. The roads were
      rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the
      camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian were obliged
      to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every
      obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries,
      who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt
      themselves animated by the spirit of their leader. The damage was
      gradually repaired; the waters were restored to their proper
      channels; whole groves of palm-trees were cut down, and placed
      along the broken parts of the road; and the army passed over the
      broad and deeper canals, on bridges of floating rafts, which were
      supported by the help of bladders. Two cities of Assyria presumed
      to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they both paid the
      severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty miles
      from the royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, 5711 or Anbar,
      held the second rank in the province; a city, large, populous,
      and well fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost
      encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the
      valor of a numerous garrison. The exhortations of Hormisdas were
      repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the Persian prince were
      wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth,
      he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country.
      The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well as
      vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram,
      having opened a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of
      the wall, they hastily retired into the fortifications of the
      interior citadel. The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into
      the town, and after the full gratification of every military
      appetite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the engines which
      assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking
      houses. The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual
      discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the
      Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistæ
      and catapultæ was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground
      on the side of the besieged. But as soon as an _Helepolis_ had
      been constructed, which could engage on equal terms with the
      loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that
      would leave no hope of resistance or mercy, terrified the
      defenders of the citadel into an humble submission; and the place
      was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under
      the walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five hundred persons, of
      both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were
      permitted to retire; the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms,
      and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the
      troops, and partly reserved for the public service; the useless
      stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the
      Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin
      of Perisabor.

      by sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid
      walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at
      the distance of eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of
      Persia. The emperor, apprehensive of leaving such an important
      fortress in his rear, immediately formed the siege of
      Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was distributed, for that
      purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head of the
      cavalry, and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to
      clear the country, as far as the banks of the Tigris, and the
      suburbs of Ctesiphon. The conduct of the attack was assumed by
      Julian himself, who seemed to place his whole dependence in the
      military engines which he erected against the walls; while he
      secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his
      troops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Nevitta
      and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a considerable
      distance, and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the
      ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the
      incessant labor of the troops, a mine was carried under the
      foundations of the walls, and sustained, at sufficient intervals,
      by props of timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a single
      file, silently explored the dark and dangerous passage; till
      their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence, that he
      was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the
      hostile city. Julian checked their ardor, that he might insure
      their success; and immediately diverted the attention of the
      garrison, by the tumult and clamor of a general assault. The
      Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously beheld the
      progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of triumph
      the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he
      might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope
      to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was already
      taken. History has recorded the name of a private soldier the
      first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower. The
      passage was widened by his companions, who pressed forwards with
      impatient valor. Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the
      midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned the walls,
      and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst
      open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by
      lust or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre.
      The governor, who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt
      alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of having uttered some
      disrespectful words against the honor of Prince Hormisdas. The
      fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a vestige was
      left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The
      neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three
      stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that
      could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The
      pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris,
      was improved, according to the Persian taste, by the symmetry of
      flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and spacious parks were
      enclosed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars,
      which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure
      of the royal chase. The park walls were broken down, the savage
      game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces
      of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command of the Roman
      emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant, or
      careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and
      refinement of polished ages have established between hostile
      princes. Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts
      any vehement emotions of pity or resentment. A simple, naked
      statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian artist, is of more
      genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of
      Barbaric labor; and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin
      of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity
      must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of
      human life. 57

      Julian was an object of hatred and terror to the Persian and the
      painters of that nation represented the invader of their country
      under the emblem of a furious lion, who vomited from his mouth a
      consuming fire. 58 To his friends and soldiers the philosophic
      hero appeared in a more amiable light; and his virtues were never
      more conspicuously displayed, than in the last and most active
      period of his life. He practised, without effort, and almost
      without merit, the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety.
      According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom, which
      assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body, he sternly
      refused himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites. 59
      In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a luxurious
      people to the gratification of every sensual desire, 60 a
      youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate; nor
      was Julian ever tempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit
      his female captives of exquisite beauty, 61 who, instead of
      resisting his power, would have disputed with each other the
      honor of his embraces. With the same firmness that he resisted
      the allurements of love, he sustained the hardships of war. When
      the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country, their
      sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared their
      fatigues and animated their diligence. In every useful labor, the
      hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple
      was wet and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier.
      The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of
      signalizing his personal valor, which, in the improved state of
      the military art, can seldom be exerted by a prudent general. The
      emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his
      extreme danger, and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates
      of iron, till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile
      weapons and huge stones, that were directed against his person.
      As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha, two
      Persians, devoting themselves for their country, suddenly rushed
      upon him with drawn cimeters: the emperor dexterously received
      their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a steady and
      well-aimed thrust, laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet.
      The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he
      approves, is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject; and
      the authority which Julian derived from his personal merit,
      enabled him to revive and enforce the rigor of ancient
      discipline. He punished with death or ignominy the misbehavior of
      three troops of horse, who, in a skirmish with the Surenas, had
      lost their honor and one of their standards: and he distinguished
      with _obsidional_ 62 crowns the valor of the foremost soldiers,
      who had ascended into the city of Maogamalcha.

      After the siege of Perisabor, the firmness of the emperor was
      exercised by the insolent avarice of the army, who loudly
      complained, that their services were rewarded by a trifling
      donative of one hundred pieces of silver. His just indignation
      was expressed in the grave and manly language of a Roman. “Riches
      are the object of your desires; those riches are in the hands of
      the Persians; and the spoils of this fruitful country are
      proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline. Believe me,”
      added Julian, “the Roman republic, which formerly possessed such
      immense treasures, is now reduced to want and wretchedness once
      our princes have been persuaded, by weak and interested
      ministers, to purchase with gold the tranquillity of the
      Barbarians. The revenue is exhausted; the cities are ruined; the
      provinces are dispeopled. For myself, the only inheritance that I
      have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of
      fear; and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is
      seated in the mind, I shall not blush to acknowledge an honorable
      poverty, which, in the days of ancient virtue, was considered as
      the glory of Fabricius. That glory, and that virtue, may be your
      own, if you will listen to the voice of Heaven and of your
      leader. But if you will rashly persist, if you are determined to
      renew the shameful and mischievous examples of old seditions,
      proceed. As it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank
      among men, I am prepared to die, standing; and to despise a
      precarious life, which, every hour, may depend on an accidental
      fever. If I have been found unworthy of the command, there are
      now among you, (I speak it with pride and pleasure,) there are
      many chiefs whose merit and experience are equal to the conduct
      of the most important war. Such has been the temper of my reign,
      that I can retire, without regret, and without apprehension, to
      the obscurity of a private station” 63 The modest resolution of
      Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful
      obedience of the Romans, who declared their confidence of
      victory, while they fought under the banners of their heroic
      prince. Their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar
      asseverations, (for such wishes were the oaths of Julian,) “So
      may I reduce the Persians under the yoke!” “Thus may I restore
      the strength and splendor of the republic!” The love of fame was
      the ardent passion of his soul: but it was not before he trampled
      on the ruins of Maogamalcha, that he allowed himself to say, “We
      have now provided some materials for the sophist of Antioch.” 64

      The successful valor of Julian had triumphed over all the
      obstacles that opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon. But
      the reduction, or even the siege, of the capital of Persia, was
      still at a distance: nor can the military conduct of the emperor
      be clearly apprehended, without a knowledge of the country which
      was the theatre of his bold and skilful operations. 65 Twenty
      miles to the south of Bagdad, and on the eastern bank of the
      Tigris, the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of
      the palaces of Ctesiphon, which, in the time of Julian, was a
      great and populous city. The name and glory of the adjacent
      Seleucia were forever extinguished; and the only remaining
      quarter of that Greek colony had resumed, with the Assyrian
      language and manners, the primitive appellation of Coche. Coche
      was situate on the western side of the Tigris; but it was
      naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we may
      suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats.

      The united parts contribute to form the common epithet of Al
      Modain, the cities, which the Orientals have bestowed on the
      winter residence of the Sassinadees; and the whole circumference
      of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of
      the river, by lofty walls, and by impracticable morasses. Near
      the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was fixed, and secured,
      by a ditch and rampart, against the sallies of the numerous and
      enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and pleasant
      country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and
      forage: and several forts, which might have embarrassed the
      motions of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the
      efforts of their valor. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into
      an artificial derivation of that river, which pours a copious and
      navigable stream into the Tigris, at a small distance _below_ the
      great city. If they had followed this royal canal, which bore the
      name of Nahar-Malcha, 66 the intermediate situation of Coche
      would have separated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash
      attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris, and
      forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital, must
      have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy.
      The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the
      remedy. As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in
      the same country, he soon recollected that his warlike
      predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal, which, leaving
      Coche on the right hand, conveyed the waters of the Nahar-Malcha
      into the river Tigris, at some distance _above_ the cities. From
      the information of the peasants, Julian ascertained the vestiges
      of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design or
      accident. By the indefatigable labor of the soldiers, a broad and
      deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the
      Euphrates. A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the
      ordinary current of the Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters rushed
      impetuously into their new bed; and the Roman fleet, steering
      their triumphant course into the Tigris, derided the vain and
      ineffectual barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected
      to oppose their passage.

      traveller, Pietro della Valle, (tom. i. lett. xvii. p. 650-780,)
      seems to be the most intelligent spectator of that famous
      province. He is a gentleman and a scholar, but intolerably vain
      and prolix.]

      explain the seeming contradictions of antiquity. In the time of
      Julian, it must have fallen into the Euphrates _below_
      Ctesiphon.]

      As it became necessary to transport the Roman army over the
      Tigris, another labor presented itself, of less toil, but of more
      danger, than the preceding expedition. The stream was broad and
      rapid; the ascent steep and difficult; and the intrenchments
      which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank, were
      lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirrasiers, dexterous
      archers, and huge elephants; who (according to the extravagant
      hyperbole of Libanius) could trample with the same ease a field
      of corn, or a legion of Romans. 67 In the presence of such an
      enemy, the construction of a bridge was impracticable; and the
      intrepid prince, who instantly seized the only possible
      expedient, concealed his design, till the moment of execution,
      from the knowledge of the Barbarians, of his own troops, and even
      of his generals themselves. Under the specious pretence of
      examining the state of the magazines, fourscore vessels 6711 were
      gradually unladen; and a select detachment, apparently destined
      for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms on
      the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own
      mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile
      nations with the spectacle of military games, which he
      insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was
      consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was
      passed, the emperor summoned the generals to his tent, and
      acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of
      the Tigris. They stood in silent and respectful astonishment;
      but, when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age
      and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the
      weight of his prudent remonstrances. 68 Julian contented himself
      with observing, that conquest and safety depended on the attempt;
      that instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies would be
      increased, by successive reenforcements; and that a longer delay
      would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the
      height of the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed;
      the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels
      that lay nearest to the bank; and as they plied their oars with
      intrepid diligence, they were lost, after a few moments, in the
      darkness of the night. A flame arose on the opposite side; and
      Julian, who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels, in
      attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterously
      converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory. “Our
      fellow-soldiers,” he eagerly exclaimed, “are already masters of
      the bank; see—they make the appointed signal; let us hasten to
      emulate and assist their courage.” The united and rapid motion of
      a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached
      the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to
      extinguish the flames, and rescue their adventurous companions.
      The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were increased by
      the weight of armor, and the darkness of the night. A shower of
      stones, darts, and fire, was incessantly discharged on the heads
      of the assailants; who, after an arduous struggle, climbed the
      bank and stood victorious upon the rampart. As soon as they
      possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with his light
      infantry, had led the attack, 69 darted through the ranks a
      skilful and experienced eye: his bravest soldiers, according to
      the precepts of Homer, 70 were distributed in the front and rear:
      and all the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle. The
      Romans, after sending up a military shout, advanced in measured
      steps to the animating notes of martial music; launched their
      formidable javelins; and rushed forwards with drawn swords, to
      deprive the Barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage of
      their missile weapons. The whole engagement lasted above twelve
      hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into
      a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by
      the principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were pursued
      to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered
      the dismayed city, 71 if their general, Victor, who was
      dangerously wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to
      desist from a rash attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not
      successful. On _their_ side, the Romans acknowledged the loss of
      only seventy-five men; while they affirmed, that the Barbarians
      had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred, or
      even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers. The spoil was such
      as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental
      camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms and
      trappings, and beds and tables of massy silver. 7111 The
      victorious emperor distributed, as the rewards of valor, some
      honorable gifts, civic, and mural, and naval crowns; which he,
      and perhaps he alone, esteemed more precious than the wealth of
      Asia. A solemn sacrifice was offered to the god of war, but the
      appearances of the victims threatened the most inauspicious
      events; and Julian soon discovered, by less ambiguous signs, that
      he had now reached the term of his prosperity. 72

      Tigris. 73 While the Persians beheld from the walls of Ctesiphon
      the desolation of the adjacent country, Julian cast many an
      anxious look towards the North, in full expectation, that as he
      himself had victoriously penetrated to the capital of Sapor, the
      march and junction of his lieutenants, Sebastian and Procopius,
      would be executed with the same courage and diligence. His
      expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian
      king, who permitted, and most probably directed, the desertion of
      his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans; 74 and by the
      dissensions of the two generals, who were incapable of forming or
      executing any plan for the public service. When the emperor had
      relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement, he
      condescended to hold a council of war, and approved, after a full
      debate, the sentiment of those generals, who dissuaded the siege
      of Ctesiphon, as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking. It is
      not easy for us to conceive, by what arts of fortification a city
      thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian could be
      rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans,
      commanded by a brave and experienced general, and abundantly
      supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and military
      stores. But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and
      contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he
      was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles. 75 At
      the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he
      rejected, with obstinacy and disdain, the most flattering offers
      of a negotiation of peace. Sapor, who had been so long accustomed
      to the tardy ostentation of Constantius, was surprised by the
      intrepid diligence of his successor. As far as the confines of
      India and Scythia, the satraps of the distant provinces were
      ordered to assemble their troops, and to march, without delay, to
      the assistance of their monarch. But their preparations were
      dilatory, their motions slow; and before Sapor could lead an army
      into the field, he received the melancholy intelligence of the
      devastation of Assyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the
      slaughter of his bravest troops, who defended the passage of the
      Tigris. The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust; he took his
      repasts on the ground; and the disorder of his hair expressed the
      grief and anxiety of his mind. Perhaps he would not have refused
      to purchase, with one half of his kingdom, the safety of the
      remainder; and he would have gladly subscribed himself, in a
      treaty of peace, the faithful and dependent ally of the Roman
      conqueror. Under the pretence of private business, a minister of
      rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the knees
      of Hormisdas, and to request, in the language of a suppliant,
      that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor. The
      Sassanian prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or
      humanity, whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or
      the duties of his situation, was equally inclined to promote a
      salutary measure, which would terminate the calamities of Persia,
      and secure the triumph of Rome. He was astonished by the
      inflexible firmness of a hero, who remembered, most unfortunately
      for himself and for his country, that Alexander had uniformly
      rejected the propositions of Darius. But as Julian was sensible,
      that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might cool the ardor
      of his troops, he earnestly requested that Hormisdas would
      privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this
      dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp. 76

      Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.—Part IV.


      The honor, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume
      his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as
      he defied the Barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on
      the open plain, they prudently replied, that if he desired to
      exercise his valor, he might seek the army of the Great King. He
      felt the insult, and he accepted the advice. Instead of confining
      his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris, he
      resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander, and
      boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced his
      rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for
      the empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and
      betrayed, by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of
      his country, had generously submitted to act a part full of
      danger, of falsehood, and of shame. 77 With a train of faithful
      followers, he deserted to the Imperial camp; exposed, in a
      specious tale, the injuries which he had sustained; exaggerated
      the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent of the people, and the
      weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered himself as the
      hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational grounds
      of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and
      experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the
      traitor into his bosom, was persuaded to issue a hasty order,
      which, in the opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his
      prudence, and to endanger his safety. He destroyed, in a single
      hour, the whole navy, which had been transported above five
      hundred miles, at so great an expense of toil, of treasure, and
      of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two small vessels were
      saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the army, and to
      form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers. A supply
      of twenty days’ provisions was reserved for the use of the
      soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven
      hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were
      abandoned to the flames, by the absolute command of the emperor.
      The Christian bishops, Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness
      of the Apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the sentence
      of divine justice. Their authority, of less weight, perhaps, in a
      military question, is confirmed by the cool judgment of an
      experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the
      conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs
      of the troops. 78 Yet there are not wanting some specious, and
      perhaps solid, reasons, which might justify the resolution of
      Julian. The navigation of the Euphrates never ascended above
      Babylon, nor that of the Tigris above Opis. 79 The distance of
      the last-mentioned city from the Roman camp was not very
      considerable: and Julian must soon have renounced the vain and
      impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against
      the stream of a rapid river, 80 which in several places was
      embarrassed by natural or artificial cataracts. 81 The power of
      sails and oars was insufficient; it became necessary to tow the
      ships against the current of the river; the strength of twenty
      thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile
      labor, and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of
      the Tigris, they could only expect to return home without
      achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their
      leader. If, on the contrary, it was advisable to advance into the
      inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was
      the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the
      hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be
      poured from the gates of Ctesiphon. Had the arms of Julian been
      victorious, we should now admire the conduct, as well as the
      courage, of a hero, who, by depriving his soldiers of the hopes
      of a retreat, left them only the alternative of death or
      conquest. 82

      The cumbersome train of artillery and wagons, which retards the
      operations of a modern army, were in a great measure unknown in
      the camps of the Romans. 83 Yet, in every age, the subsistence of
      sixty thousand men must have been one of the most important cares
      of a prudent general; and that subsistence could only be drawn
      from his own or from the enemy’s country. Had it been possible
      for Julian to maintain a bridge of communication on the Tigris,
      and to preserve the conquered places of Assyria, a desolated
      province could not afford any large or regular supplies, in a
      season of the year when the lands were covered by the inundation
      of the Euphrates, 84 and the unwholesome air was darkened with
      swarms of innumerable insects. 85 The appearance of the hostile
      country was far more inviting. The extensive region that lies
      between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled
      with villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part,
      was in a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect,
      that a conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of
      persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful
      subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the
      approach of the Romans, the rich and smiling prospect was
      instantly blasted. Wherever they moved, the inhabitants deserted
      the open villages, and took shelter in the fortified towns; the
      cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed
      with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which
      interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of
      a smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method
      of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who
      prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigor of
      an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without
      submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice. On the
      present occasion the zeal and obedience of the Persians seconded
      the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was soon reduced to the
      scanty stock of provisions, which continually wasted in his
      hands. Before they were entirely consumed, he might still have
      reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or Susa, by
      the effort of a rapid and well-directed march; 86 but he was
      deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads, and
      by the perfidy of his guides. The Romans wandered several days in
      the country to the eastward of Bagdad; the Persian deserter, who
      had artfully led them into the snare, escaped from their
      resentment; and his followers, as soon as they were put to the
      torture, confessed the secret of the conspiracy. The visionary
      conquests of Hyrcania and India, which had so long amused, now
      tormented, the mind of Julian. Conscious that his own imprudence
      was the cause of the public distress, he anxiously balanced the
      hopes of safety or success, without obtaining a satisfactory
      answer, either from gods or men. At length, as the only
      practicable measure, he embraced the resolution of directing his
      steps towards the banks of the Tigris, with the design of saving
      the army by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene; a fertile
      and friendly province, which acknowledged the sovereignty of
      Rome. The desponding troops obeyed the signal of the retreat,
      only seventy days after they had passed the Chaboras, with the
      sanguine expectation of subverting the throne of Persia. 87

      iii. p. 183.) The two last seem ignorant that their conqueror was
      retreating; and Libanius absurdly confines him to the banks of
      the Tigris.]

      As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country, their
      march was observed and insulted from a distance, by several
      bodies of Persian cavalry; who, showing themselves sometimes in
      loose, and sometimes in close order, faintly skirmished with the
      advanced guards. These detachments were, however, supported by a
      much greater force; and the heads of the columns were no sooner
      pointed towards the Tigris than a cloud of dust arose on the
      plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to the permission of a
      safe and speedy retreat, endeavored to persuade themselves, that
      this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild
      asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They
      halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the
      whole night in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of
      day, that they were surrounded by an army of Persians. This army,
      which might be considered only as the van of the Barbarians, was
      soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers, archers, and
      elephants, commanded by Meranes, a general of rank and
      reputation. He was accompanied by two of the king’s sons, and
      many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation
      exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly
      advanced under the conduct of Sapor himself. As the Romans
      continued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend
      or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, afforded
      frequent and favorable opportunities to their vigilant enemies.
      The Persians repeatedly charged with fury; they were repeatedly
      repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga, which almost
      deserved the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable loss
      of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of
      their monarch. These splendid advantages were not obtained
      without an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several
      officers of distinction were either killed or wounded; and the
      emperor himself, who, on all occasions of danger, inspired and
      guided the valor of his troops, was obliged to expose his person,
      and exert his abilities. The weight of offensive and defensive
      arms, which still constituted the strength and safety of the
      Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit;
      and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their
      javelins, and shoot their arrows, at full speed, and in every
      possible direction, 88 the cavalry of Persia was never more
      formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight.
      But the most certain and irreparable loss of the Romans was that
      of time. The hardy veterans, accustomed to the cold climate of
      Gaul and Germany, fainted under the sultry heat of an Assyrian
      summer; their vigor was exhausted by the incessant repetition of
      march and combat; and the progress of the army was suspended by
      the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat, in the presence
      of an active enemy. Every day, every hour, as the supply
      diminished, the value and price of subsistence increased in the
      Roman camp. 89 Julian, who always contented himself with such
      food as a hungry soldier would have disdained, distributed, for
      the use of the troops, the provisions of the Imperial household,
      and whatever could be spared, from the sumpter-horses, of the
      tribunes and generals. But this feeble relief served only to
      aggravate the sense of the public distress; and the Romans began
      to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that, before they
      could reach the frontiers of the empire, they should all perish,
      either by famine, or by the sword of the Barbarians. 90

      While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties
      of his situation, the silent hours of the night were still
      devoted to study and contemplation. Whenever he closed his eyes
      in short and interrupted slumbers, his mind was agitated with
      painful anxiety; nor can it be thought surprising, that the
      Genius of the empire should once more appear before him, covering
      with a funeral veil his head, and his horn of abundance, and
      slowly retiring from the Imperial tent. The monarch started from
      his couch, and stepping forth to refresh his wearied spirits with
      the coolness of the midnight air, he beheld a fiery meteor, which
      shot athwart the sky, and suddenly vanished. Julian was convinced
      that he had seen the menacing countenance of the god of war; 91
      the council which he summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices, 92
      unanimously pronounced that he should abstain from action; but on
      this occasion, necessity and reason were more prevalent than
      superstition; and the trumpets sounded at the break of day. The
      army marched through a hilly country; and the hills had been
      secretly occupied by the Persians. Julian led the van with the
      skill and attention of a consummate general; he was alarmed by
      the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked. The heat of
      the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but he
      snatched a shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with
      a sufficient reenforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A
      similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the
      front; and, as he galloped through the columns, the centre of the
      left was attacked, and almost overpowered by the furious charge
      of the Persian cavalry and elephants. This huge body was soon
      defeated, by the well-timed evolution of the light infantry, who
      aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, against the backs
      of the horsemen, and the legs of the elephants. The Barbarians
      fled; and Julian, who was foremost in every danger, animated the
      pursuit with his voice and gestures. His trembling guards,
      scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and
      enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without
      armor; and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending
      ruin. As they exclaimed, 93 a cloud of darts and arrows was
      discharged from the flying squadrons; and a javelin, after razing
      the skin of his arm, transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the
      inferior part of the liver. Julian attempted to draw the deadly
      weapon from his side; but his fingers were cut by the sharpness
      of the steel, and he fell senseless from his horse. His guards
      flew to his relief; and the wounded emperor was gently raised
      from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle
      into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy event passed
      from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inspired them with
      invincible valor, and the desire of revenge. The bloody and
      obstinate conflict was maintained by the two armies, till they
      were separated by the total darkness of the night. The Persians
      derived some honor from the advantage which they obtained against
      the left wing, where Anatolius, master of the offices, was slain,
      and the præfect Sallust very narrowly escaped. But the event of
      the day was adverse to the Barbarians. They abandoned the field;
      their two generals, Meranes and Nohordates, 94 fifty nobles or
      satraps, and a multitude of their bravest soldiers; and the
      success of the Romans, if Julian had survived, might have been
      improved into a decisive and useful victory.

      The first words that Julian uttered, after his recovery from the
      fainting fit into which he had been thrown by loss of blood, were
      expressive of his martial spirit. He called for his horse and
      arms, and was impatient to rush into the battle. His remaining
      strength was exhausted by the painful effort; and the surgeons,
      who examined his wound, discovered the symptoms of approaching
      death. He employed the awful moments with the firm temper of a
      hero and a sage; the philosophers who had accompanied him in this
      fatal expedition, compared the tent of Julian with the prison of
      Socrates; and the spectators, whom duty, or friendship, or
      curiosity, had assembled round his couch, listened with
      respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor.
      95 “Friends and fellow-soldiers, the seasonable period of my
      departure is now arrived, and I discharge, with the cheerfulness
      of a ready debtor, the demands of nature. I have learned from
      philosophy, how much the soul is more excellent than the body;
      and that the separation of the nobler substance should be the
      subject of joy, rather than of affliction. I have learned from
      religion, that an early death has often been the reward of piety;
      96 and I accept, as a favor of the gods, the mortal stroke that
      secures me from the danger of disgracing a character, which has
      hitherto been supported by virtue and fortitude. I die without
      remorse, as I have lived without guilt. I am pleased to reflect
      on the innocence of my private life; and I can affirm with
      confidence, that the supreme authority, that emanation of the
      Divine Power, has been preserved in my hands pure and immaculate.
      Detesting the corrupt and destructive maxims of despotism, I have
      considered the happiness of the people as the end of government.
      Submitting my actions to the laws of prudence, of justice, and of
      moderation, I have trusted the event to the care of Providence.
      Peace was the object of my counsels, as long as peace was
      consistent with the public welfare; but when the imperious voice
      of my country summoned me to arms, I exposed my person to the
      dangers of war, with the clear foreknowledge (which I had
      acquired from the art of divination) that I was destined to fall
      by the sword. I now offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal
      Being, who has not suffered me to perish by the cruelty of a
      tyrant, by the secret dagger of conspiracy, or by the slow
      tortures of lingering disease. He has given me, in the midst of
      an honorable career, a splendid and glorious departure from this
      world; and I hold it equally absurd, equally base, to solicit, or
      to decline, the stroke of fate. This much I have attempted to
      say; but my strength fails me, and I feel the approach of death.
      I shall cautiously refrain from any word that may tend to
      influence your suffrages in the election of an emperor. My choice
      might be imprudent or injudicious; and if it should not be
      ratified by the consent of the army, it might be fatal to the
      person whom I should recommend. I shall only, as a good citizen,
      express my hopes, that the Romans may be blessed with the
      government of a virtuous sovereign.” After this discourse, which
      Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone of voice, he
      distributed, by a military testament, 97 the remains of his
      private fortune; and making some inquiry why Anatolius was not
      present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that
      Anatolius was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency,
      the loss of his friend. At the same time he reproved the
      immoderate grief of the spectators; and conjured them not to
      disgrace, by unmanly tears, the fate of a prince, who in a few
      moments would be united with heaven, and with the stars. 98 The
      spectators were silent; and Julian entered into a metaphysical
      argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus, on the nature
      of the soul. The efforts which he made, of mind as well as body,
      most probably hastened his death. His wound began to bleed with
      fresh violence; his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling
      of the veins; he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon
      as he had drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of
      midnight. Such was the end of that extraordinary man, in the
      thirty-second year of his age, after a reign of one year and
      about eight months, from the death of Constantius. In his last
      moments he displayed, perhaps with some ostentation, the love of
      virtue and of fame, which had been the ruling passions of his
      life. 99

      observations. Divine Legation, vol ii. p. 199-216.]

      99 (return) [ The whole relation of the death of Julian is given
      by Ammianus, (xxv. 3,) an intelligent spectator. Libanius, who
      turns with horror from the scene, has supplied some
      circumstances, (Orat. Parental. c 136-140, p. 359-362.) The
      calumnies of Gregory, and the legends of more recent saints, may
      now be _silently_ despised. * Note: A very remarkable fragment of
      Eunapius describes, not without spirit, the struggle between the
      terror of the army on account of their perilous situation, and
      their grief for the death of Julian. “Even the vulgar felt that
      they would soon provide a general, but such a general as Julian
      they would never find, even though a god in the form of
      man—Julian, who, with a mind equal to the divinity, triumphed
      over the evil propensities of human nature,—* * who held commerce
      with immaterial beings while yet in the material body—who
      condescended to rule because a ruler was necessary to the welfare
      of mankind.” Mai, Nov. Coll. ii. 261. Eunapius in Niebuhr, 69.]

      The triumph of Christianity, and the calamities of the empire,
      may, in some measure, be ascribed to Julian himself, who had
      neglected to secure the future execution of his designs, by the
      timely and judicious nomination of an associate and successor.
      But the royal race of Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own
      person; and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing
      with the purple the most worthy among the Romans, he was diverted
      from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice, the jealousy
      of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural presumption of
      health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death left
      the empire without a master, and without an heir, in a state of
      perplexity and danger, which, in the space of fourscore years,
      had never been experienced, since the election of Diocletian. In
      a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure
      and noble blood, the superiority of birth was of little moment;
      the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious; and
      the candidates, who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne
      could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit,
      or by the hopes of popular favor. But the situation of a famished
      army, encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians, shortened
      the moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of terror
      and distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his
      own directions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day,
      the generals convened a military senate, at which the commanders
      of the legions, and the officers both of cavalry and infantry,
      were invited to assist. Three or four hours of the night had not
      passed away without some secret cabals; and when the election of
      an emperor was proposed, the spirit of faction began to agitate
      the assembly. Victor and Arinthæus collected the remains of the
      court of Constantius; the friends of Julian attached themselves
      to the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the most fatal
      consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two
      factions, so opposite in their character and interest, in their
      maxims of government, and perhaps in their religious principles.
      The superior virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their
      divisions, and unite their suffrages; and the venerable præfect
      would immediately have been declared the successor of Julian, if
      he himself, with sincere and modest firmness, had not alleged his
      age and infirmities, so unequal to the weight of the diadem. The
      generals, who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal, showed
      some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior
      officer, 100 that they should act as they would have acted in the
      absence of the emperor; that they should exert their abilities to
      extricate the army from the present distress; and, if they were
      fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia, they
      should proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the
      election of a lawful sovereign. While they debated, a few voices
      saluted Jovian, who was no more than _first_ 101 of the
      domestics, with the names of Emperor and Augustus. The tumultuary
      acclamation 10111 was instantly repeated by the guards who
      surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the
      extremities of the line. The new prince, astonished with his own
      fortune was hastily invested with the Imperial ornaments, and
      received an oath of fidelity from the generals, whose favor and
      protection he so lately solicited. The strongest recommendation
      of Jovian was the merit of his father, Count Varronian, who
      enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit of his long services.
      In the obscure freedom of a private station, the son indulged his
      taste for wine and women; yet he supported, with credit, the
      character of a Christian 102 and a soldier. Without being
      conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite
      the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian,
      his cheerful temper, and familiar wit, had gained the affection
      of his fellow-soldiers; and the generals of both parties
      acquiesced in a popular election, which had not been conducted by
      the arts of their enemies. The pride of this unexpected elevation
      was moderated by the just apprehension, that the same day might
      terminate the life and reign of the new emperor. The pressing
      voice of necessity was obeyed without delay; and the first orders
      issued by Jovian, a few hours after his predecessor had expired,
      were to prosecute a march, which could alone extricate the Romans
      from their actual distress. 103

      reign; and piously suppose that he refused the purple, till the
      whole army unanimously exclaimed that they were Christians.

      Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.—Part V.


      The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears;
      and the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with
      which he celebrates his deliverance. The welcome news of the
      death of Julian, which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor,
      inspired the desponding monarch with a sudden confidence of
      victory. He immediately detached the royal cavalry, perhaps the
      ten thousand _Immortals_, 104 to second and support the pursuit;
      and discharged the whole weight of his united forces on the
      rear-guard of the Romans. The rear-guard was thrown into
      disorder; the renowned legions, which derived their titles from
      Diocletian, and his warlike colleague, were broke and trampled
      down by the elephants; and three tribunes lost their lives in
      attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers. The battle was
      at length restored by the persevering valor of the Romans; the
      Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and
      elephants; and the army, after marching and fighting a long
      summer’s day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the banks of
      the Tigris, about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon. 105 On the
      ensuing day, the Barbarians, instead of harassing the march,
      attacked the camp, of Jovian; which had been seated in a deep and
      sequestered valley. From the hills, the archers of Persia
      insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries; and a body of
      cavalry, which had penetrated with desperate courage through the
      Prætorian gate, was cut in pieces, after a doubtful conflict,
      near the Imperial tent. In the succeeding night, the camp of
      Carche was protected by the lofty dikes of the river; and the
      Roman army, though incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit
      of the Saracens, pitched their tents near the city of Dura, 106
      four days after the death of Julian. The Tigris was still on
      their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and
      the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves that
      the frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their
      new sovereign, that they might be permitted to hazard the passage
      of the river. With the assistance of his wisest officers, Jovian
      endeavored to check their rashness; by representing, that if they
      possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a
      deep and rapid stream, they would only deliver themselves naked
      and defenceless to the Barbarians, who had occupied the opposite
      banks, Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities, he
      consented, with reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans,
      accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and
      Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve
      either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the
      army. In the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris,
      surprised an unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the
      dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune. The
      success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the
      promises of his architects, who propose to construct a floating
      bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and goats, covered
      with a floor of earth and fascines. 107 Two important days were
      spent in the ineffectual labor; and the Romans, who already
      endured the miseries of famine, cast a look of despair on the
      Tigris, and upon the Barbarians; whose numbers and obstinacy
      increased with the distress of the Imperial army. 108

      incline us to suspect that Ammianus had been too jealous of the
      honor of the Roman arms.]

      In this hopeless condition, the fainting spirits of the Romans
      were revived by the sound of peace. The transient presumption of
      Sapor had vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in
      the repetition of doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful
      and intrepid nobles, his bravest troops, and the greatest part of
      his train of elephants: and the experienced monarch feared to
      provoke the resistance of despair, the vicissitudes of fortune,
      and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire; which might soon
      advance to elieve, or to revenge, the successor of Julian. The
      Surenas himself, accompanied by another satrap, appeared in the
      camp of Jovian; 109 and declared, that the clemency of his
      sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he
      would consent to spare and to dismiss the Cæsar with the relics
      of his captive army. 10911 The hopes of safety subdued the
      firmness of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice
      of his council, and the cries of his soldiers, to embrace the
      offer of peace; 10912 and the præfect Sallust was immediately
      sent, with the general Arinthæus, to understand the pleasure of
      the Great King. The crafty Persian delayed, under various
      pretenses, the conclusion of the agreement; started difficulties,
      required explanations, suggested expedients, receded from his
      concessions, increased his demands, and wasted four days in the
      arts of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions
      which yet remained in the camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been
      capable of executing a bold and prudent measure, he would have
      continued his march, with unremitting diligence; the progress of
      the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the Barbarians;
      and, before the expiration of the fourth day, he might have
      safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at the distance
      only of one hundred miles. 110 The irresolute emperor, instead of
      breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected his fate with
      patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of
      peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse. The five
      provinces beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the
      grandfather of Sapor, were restored to the Persian monarchy. He
      acquired, by a single article, the impregnable city of Nisibis;
      which had sustained, in three successive sieges, the effort of
      his arms. Singara, and the castle of the Moors, one of the
      strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise dismembered from
      the empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that the
      inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with
      their effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted, that the
      Romans should forever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia.
      11011 A peace, or rather a long truce, of thirty years, was
      stipulated between the hostile nations; the faith of the treaty
      was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies; and
      hostages of distinguished rank were reciprocally delivered to
      secure the performance of the conditions. 111

      The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of
      his hero in the feeble hand of a Christian successor, professes
      to admire the moderation of Sapor, in contenting himself with so
      small a portion of the Roman empire. If he had stretched as far
      as the Euphrates the claims of his ambition, he might have been
      secure, says Libanius, of not meeting with a refusal. If he had
      fixed, as the boundary of Persia, the Orontes, the Cydnus, the
      Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus, flatterers would not
      have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid
      monarch, that his remaining provinces would still afford the most
      ample gratifications of power and luxury. 112 Without adopting in
      its full force this malicious insinuation, we must acknowledge,
      that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by
      the private ambition of Jovian. The obscure domestic, exalted to
      the throne by fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to
      escape from the hands of the Persians, that he might prevent the
      designs of Procopius, who commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and
      establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which
      were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the
      camp beyond the Tigris. 113 In the neighborhood of the same
      river, at no very considerable distance from the fatal station of
      Dura, 114 the ten thousand Greeks, without generals, or guides,
      or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred miles from
      their native country, to the resentment of a victorious monarch.
      The difference of _their_ conduct and success depended much more
      on their character than on their situation. Instead of tamely
      resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private
      views of a single person, the united councils of the Greeks were
      inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly; where
      the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory, the
      pride of freedom, and the contempt of death. Conscious of their
      superiority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline, they
      disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every obstacle
      was surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill;
      and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and
      insulted the weakness of the Persian monarchy. 115

      As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might
      perhaps have stipulated, that the camp of the hungry Romans
      should be plentifully supplied; 116 and that they should be
      permitted to pass the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed
      by the hands of the Persians. But, if Jovian presumed to solicit
      those equitable terms, they were sternly refused by the haughty
      tyrant of the East, whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of
      his country. The Saracens sometimes intercepted the stragglers of
      the march; but the generals and troops of Sapor respected the
      cessation of arms; and Jovian was suffered to explore the most
      convenient place for the passage of the river. The small vessels,
      which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet,
      performed the most essential service. They first conveyed the
      emperor and his favorites; and afterwards transported, in many
      successive voyages, a great part of the army. But, as every man
      was anxious for his personal safety, and apprehensive of being
      left on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were too impatient
      to wait the slow returns of the boats, boldly ventured themselves
      on light hurdles, or inflated skins; and, drawing after them
      their horses, attempted, with various success, to swim across the
      river. Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the
      waves; many others, who were carried along by the violence of the
      stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild
      Arabs: and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of
      the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle.
      As soon as the Romans were landed on the western bank, they were
      delivered from the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians; but, in a
      laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of
      Mesopotamia, they endured the last extremities of thirst and
      hunger. They were obliged to traverse the sandy desert, which, in
      the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a single blade of
      sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water; and the rest of
      the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of
      friends or enemies. Whenever a small measure of flour could be
      discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily
      purchased with ten pieces of gold: 117 the beasts of burden were
      slaughtered and devoured; and the desert was strewed with the
      arms and baggage of the Roman soldiers, whose tattered garments
      and meagre countenances displayed their past sufferings and
      actual misery. A small convoy of provisions advanced to meet the
      army as far as the castle of Ur; and the supply was the more
      grateful, since it declared the fidelity of Sebastian and
      Procopius. At Thilsaphata, 118 the emperor most graciously
      received the generals of Mesopotamia; and the remains of a once
      flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls of
      Nisibis. The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed, in the
      language of flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return;
      and the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to
      secure the allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe, by
      placing the military command in the hands of those officers, who,
      from motives of interest, or inclination, would firmly support
      the cause of their benefactor. 119

      The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of
      his expedition. They entertained a fond persuasion that the
      temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the
      East; that Persia would be reduced to the humble state of a
      tributary province, governed by the laws and magistrates of Rome;
      that the Barbarians would adopt the dress, and manners, and
      language of their conquerors; and that the youth of Ecbatana and
      Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters. 120
      The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication
      with the empire; and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris,
      his affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes
      of their prince. Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was
      disturbed by the melancholy rumor of his death; and they
      persisted to doubt, after they could no longer deny, the truth of
      that fatal event. 121 The messengers of Jovian promulgated the
      specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace; the voice of
      fame, louder and more sincere, revealed the disgrace of the
      emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious treaty. The minds
      of the people were filled with astonishment and grief, with
      indignation and terror, when they were informed, that the
      unworthy successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces
      which had been acquired by the victory of Galerius; and that he
      shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the important city of
      Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the East. 122
      The deep and dangerous question, how far the public faith should
      be observed, when it becomes incompatible with the public safety,
      was freely agitated in popular conversation; and some hopes were
      entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous
      behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy. The inflexible
      spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal
      conditions which were extorted from the distress of their captive
      armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor,
      by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the
      Barbarians, the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would
      have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times. 123

      intelligence, cast his eye on his sword; but he recollected that
      Plato had condemned suicide, and that he must live to compose the
      Panegyric of Julian, (Libanius de Vita sua, tom. ii. p. 45, 46.)]

      was not bound to execute his promise; since he _could not_
      dismember the empire, nor alienate, without their consent, the
      allegiance of his people. I have never found much delight or
      instruction in such political metaphysics.]

      But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his
      constitutional authority, was the absolute master of the laws and
      arms of the state; and the same motives which had forced him to
      subscribe, now pressed him to execute, the treaty of peace. He
      was impatient to secure an empire at the expense of a few
      provinces; and the respectable names of religion and honor
      concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian.
      Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants,
      decency, as well as prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the
      palace of Nisibis; but the next morning after his arrival,
      Bineses, the ambassador of Persia, entered the place, displayed
      from the citadel the standard of the Great King, and proclaimed,
      in his name, the cruel alternative of exile or servitude. The
      principal citizens of Nisibis, who, till that fatal moment, had
      confided in the protection of their sovereign, threw themselves
      at his feet. They conjured him not to abandon, or, at least, not
      to deliver, a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant,
      exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had
      experienced under the walls of Nisibis. They still possessed arms
      and courage to repel the invaders of their country: they
      requested only the permission of using them in their own defence;
      and, as soon as they had asserted their independence, they should
      implore the favor of being again admitted into the ranks of his
      subjects. Their arguments, their eloquence, their tears, were
      ineffectual. Jovian alleged, with some confusion, the sanctity of
      oaths; and, as the reluctance with which he accepted the present
      of a crown of gold, convinced the citizens of their hopeless
      condition, the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim, “O
      emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your
      dominions!” Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of
      a prince, 124 was displeased with freedom, and offended with
      truth: and as he reasonably supposed, that the discontent of the
      people might incline them to submit to the Persian government, he
      published an edict, under pain of death, that they should leave
      the city within the term of three days. Ammianus has delineated
      in lively colors the scene of universal despair, which he seems
      to have viewed with an eye of compassion. 125 The martial youth
      deserted, with indignant grief, the walls which they had so
      gloriously defended: the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear
      over the tomb of a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by
      the rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the aged citizen kissed
      the threshold, and clung to the doors, of the house where he had
      passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy. The highways
      were crowded with a trembling multitude: the distinctions of
      rank, and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity. Every
      one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his
      fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate service of
      an adequate number of horses or wagons, they were obliged to
      leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.
      The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the
      hardships of these unhappy fugitives. They were seated, however,
      in a new-built quarter of Amida; and that rising city, with the
      reenforcement of a very considerable colony, soon recovered its
      former splendor, and became the capital of Mesopotamia. 126
      Similar orders were despatched by the emperor for the evacuation
      of Singara and the castle of the Moors; and for the restitution
      of the five provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor enjoyed the glory
      and the fruits of his victory; and this ignominious peace has
      justly been considered as a memorable æra in the decline and fall
      of the Roman empire. The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes
      relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces;
      but, since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the
      god Terminus, who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had
      never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy. 127

      124 (return) [ At Nisibis he performed a _royal_ act. A brave
      officer, his namesake, who had been thought worthy of the purple,

      general position must be applied and interpreted with some
      caution.]

      After Jovian had performed those engagements which the voice of
      his people might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away
      from the scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole
      court to enjoy the luxury of Antioch. 128 Without consulting the
      dictates of religious zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and
      gratitude, to bestow the last honors on the remains of his
      deceased sovereign: 129 and Procopius, who sincerely bewailed the
      loss of his kinsman, was removed from the command of the army,
      under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral. The corpse
      of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus, in a slow march
      of fifteen days; and, as it passed through the cities of the
      East, was saluted by the hostile factions, with mournful
      lamentations and clamorous insults. The Pagans already placed
      their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had
      restored; while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul
      of the Apostate to hell, and his body to the grave. 130 One party
      lamented the approaching ruin of their altars; the other
      celebrated the marvellous deliverance of their church. The
      Christians applauded, in lofty and ambiguous strains, the stroke
      of divine vengeance, which had been so long suspended over the
      guilty head of Julian. They acknowledge, that the death of the
      tyrant, at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris, was
      _revealed_ to the saints of Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia; 131 and
      instead of suffering him to fall by the Persian darts, their
      indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some
      mortal or immortal champion of the faith. 132 Such imprudent
      declarations were eagerly adopted by the malice, or credulity, of
      their adversaries; 133 who darkly insinuated, or confidently
      asserted, that the governors of the church had instigated and
      directed the fanaticism of a domestic assassin. 134 Above sixteen
      years after the death of Julian, the charge was solemnly and
      vehemently urged, in a public oration, addressed by Libanius to
      the emperor Theodosius. His suspicions are unsupported by fact or
      argument; and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the sophist
      of Antioch for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend. 135

      fatal javelin, might be ignorant of its effect; or he might be
      slain in the same action. Ammianus neither feels nor inspires a
      suspicion.]

      134 (return) [ This dark and ambiguous expression may point to
      Athanasius, the first, without a rival, of the Christian clergy,

      the Huns to the criminal neglect of revenging Julian’s death.]

      It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the
      triumphs, of the Romans, that the voice of praise should be
      corrected by that of satire and ridicule; and that, in the midst
      of the splendid pageants, which displayed the glory of the living
      or of the dead, their imperfections should not be concealed from
      the eyes of the world. 136 This custom was practised in the
      funeral of Julian. The comedians, who resented his contempt and
      aversion for the theatre, exhibited, with the applause of a
      Christian audience, the lively and exaggerated representation of
      the faults and follies of the deceased emperor. His various
      character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for
      pleasantry and ridicule. 137 In the exercise of his uncommon
      talents, he often descended below the majesty of his rank.
      Alexander was transformed into Diogenes; the philosopher was
      degraded into a priest. The purity of his virtue was sullied by
      excessive vanity; his superstition disturbed the peace, and
      endangered the safety, of a mighty empire; and his irregular
      sallies were the less entitled to indulgence, as they appeared to
      be the laborious efforts of art, or even of affectation. The
      remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia; but his
      stately tomb, which arose in that city, on the banks of the cold
      and limpid Cydnus, 138 was displeasing to the faithful friends,
      who loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man. The
      philosopher expressed a very reasonable wish, that the disciple
      of Plato might have reposed amidst the groves of the academy; 139
      while the soldier exclaimed, in bolder accents, that the ashes of
      Julian should have been mingled with those of Cæsar, in the field
      of Mars, and among the ancient monuments of Roman virtue. 140 The
      history of princes does not very frequently renew the examples of
      a similar competition.

      The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in
      a very doubtful and dangerous situation. The Roman army was saved
      by an inglorious, perhaps a necessary treaty; 1 and the first
      moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore
      the domestic tranquility of the church and state. The
      indiscretion of his predecessor, instead of reconciling, had
      artfully fomented the religious war: and the balance which he
      affected to preserve between the hostile factions, served only to
      perpetuate the contest, by the vicissitudes of hope and fear, by
      the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favor. The
      Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel; and the Pagans
      had imbibed the spirit of the church. In private families, the
      sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal
      and revenge: the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the
      cities of the East were stained with blood; and the most
      implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their
      country. Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity;
      and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch, the banner of the
      Cross, the Labarum of Constantine, which was again displayed at
      the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of
      their new emperor. As soon as he ascended the throne, he
      transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces;
      in which he confessed the divine truth, and secured the legal
      establishment, of the Christian religion. The insidious edicts of
      Julian were abolished; the ecclesiastical immunities were
      restored and enlarged; and Jovian condescended to lament, that
      the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of
      charitable distributions. 2 The Christians were unanimous in the
      loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious
      successor of Julian. But they were still ignorant what creed, or
      what synod, he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy; and
      the peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes
      which had been suspended during the season of persecution. The
      episcopal leaders of the contending sects, convinced, from
      experience, how much their fate would depend on the earliest
      impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier,
      hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch. The highways of the
      East were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and Semi-Arian, and
      Eunomian bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other in the
      holy race: the apartments of the palace resounded with their
      clamors; and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps
      astonished, by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and
      passionate invective. 3 The moderation of Jovian, who recommended
      concord and charity, and referred the disputants to the sentence
      of a future council, was interpreted as a symptom of
      indifference: but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at
      length discovered and declared, by the reverence which he
      expressed for the _celestial_ 4 virtues of the great Athanasius.
      The intrepid veteran of the faith, at the age of seventy, had
      issued from his retreat on the first intelligence of the tyrant’s
      death. The acclamations of the people seated him once more on the
      archiepiscopal throne; and he wisely accepted, or anticipated,
      the invitation of Jovian. The venerable figure of Athanasius, his
      calm courage, and insinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation
      which he had already acquired in the courts of four successive
      princes. 5 As soon as he had gained the confidence, and secured
      the faith, of the Christian emperor, he returned in triumph to
      his diocese, and continued, with mature counsels and undiminished
      vigor, to direct, ten years longer, 6 the ecclesiastical
      government of Alexandria, Egypt, and the Catholic church. Before
      his departure from Antioch, he assured Jovian that his orthodox
      devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign.
      Athanasius, had reason to hope, that he should be allowed either
      the merit of a successful prediction, or the excuse of a grateful
      though ineffectual prayer. 7

      comprehensive expression, (Philostorgius, l. viii. c. 5, with

      law which condemned the rape or marriage of nuns (Cod. Theod. l.
      ix. tit. xxv. leg. 2) is exaggerated by Sozomen; who supposes,
      that an amorous glance, the adultery of the heart, was punished
      with death by the evangelic legislator.]

      and extravagant flattery of the emperor to the archbishop. (See

      and Athanasius. The primate’s journey was advised by the Egyptian

      the emperor, the primate of Egypt, and the Arian deputies. The
      Abbé is not satisfied with the coarse pleasantry of Jovian; but
      his partiality for Athanasius assumes, in _his_ eyes, the
      character of justice.]

      6 (return) [ The true area of his death is perplexed with some
      difficulties, (Tillemont, Mém. Eccles. tom. viii. p. 719-723.)
      But the date (A. D. 373, May 2) which seems the most consistent
      with history and reason, is ratified by his authentic life,
      (Maffei Osservazioni Letterarie, tom. iii. p. 81.)]

      7 (return) [ See the observations of Valesius and Jortin (Remarks
      on Ecclesiastical History, vol. iv. p. 38) on the original letter
      of Athanasius; which is preserved by Theodoret, (l. iv. c. 3.) In
      some Mss. this indiscreet promise is omitted; perhaps by the
      Catholics, jealous of the prophetic fame of their leader.]

      The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the
      natural descent of its object, operates with irresistible weight;
      and Jovian had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions
      which were supported by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and
      numbers of the most powerful sect. 8 Under his reign,
      Christianity obtained an easy and lasting victory; and as soon as
      the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn, the genius of
      Paganism, which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts
      of Julian, sunk irrecoverably in the. In many cities, the temples
      were shut or deserted: the philosophers who had abused their
      transient favor, thought it prudent to shave their beards, and
      disguise their profession; and the Christians rejoiced, that they
      were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries
      which they had suffered under the preceding reign. 9 The
      consternation of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and
      gracious edict of toleration; in which Jovian explicitly
      declared, that although he should severely punish the
      sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might exercise, with
      freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient worship. The
      memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius,
      who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople to express their
      royal devotion for the new emperor. Themistius expatiates on the
      clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the
      rights of conscience, and the independence of the mind; and, with
      some eloquence, inculcates the principles of philosophical
      toleration; whose aid Superstition herself, in the hour of her
      distress, is not ashamed to implore. He justly observes, that in
      the recent changes, both religions had been alternately disgraced
      by the seeming acquisition of worthless proselytes, of those
      votaries of the reigning purple, who could pass, without a
      reason, and without a blush, from the church to the temple, and
      from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians.

      Paris, 1684. The Abbé de la Bleterie judiciously remarks, (Hist.
      de Jovien, tom. i. p. 199,) that Sozomen has forgot the general
      toleration; and Themistius the establishment of the Catholic
      religion. Each of them turned away from the object which he
      disliked, and wished to suppress the part of the edict the least
      honorable, in his opinion, to the emperor.]

      In the space of seven months, the Roman troops, who were now
      returned to Antioch, had performed a march of fifteen hundred
      miles; in which they had endured all the hardships of war, of
      famine, and of climate. Notwithstanding their services, their
      fatigues, and the approach of winter, the timid and impatient
      Jovian allowed only, to the men and horses, a respite of six
      weeks. The emperor could not sustain the indiscreet and malicious
      raillery of the people of Antioch. 11 He was impatient to possess
      the palace of Constantinople; and to prevent the ambition of some
      competitor, who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe. But
      he soon received the grateful intelligence, that his authority
      was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic
      Ocean. By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of
      Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and
      Illyricum to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation
      of the Franks; and to his father-in-law, Count Lucillian, who had
      formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of
      Nisibis. Malarich had declined an office to which he thought
      himself unequal; and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims, in an
      accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts. 12 But the moderation
      of Jovinus, master-general of the cavalry, who forgave the
      intention of his disgrace, soon appeased the tumult, and
      confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers. The oath of
      fidelity was administered and taken, with loyal acclamations; and
      the deputies of the Western armies 13 saluted their new sovereign
      as he descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in
      Cappadocia. From Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra,
      capital of the province of Galatia; where Jovian assumed, with
      his infant son, the name and ensigns of the consulship. 14
      Dadastana, 15 an obscure town, almost at an equal distance
      between Ancyra and Nice, was marked for the fatal term of his
      journey and life. After indulging himself with a plentiful,
      perhaps an intemperate, supper, he retired to rest; and the next
      morning the emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed. The cause
      of this sudden death was variously understood. By some it was
      ascribed to the consequences of an indigestion, occasioned either
      by the quantity of the wine, or the quality of the mushrooms,
      which he had swallowed in the evening. According to others, he
      was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor of charcoal, which
      extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome
      moisture of the fresh plaster. 16 But the want of a regular
      inquiry into the death of a prince, whose reign and person were
      soon forgotten, appears to have been the only circumstance which
      countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt.
      17 The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople, to be interred
      with his predecessors, and the sad procession was met on the road
      by his wife Charito, the daughter of Count Lucillian; who still
      wept the recent death of her father, and was hastening to dry her
      tears in the embraces of an Imperial husband. Her disappointment
      and grief were imbittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness.
      Six weeks before the death of Jovian, his infant son had been
      placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of
      _Nobilissimus_, and the vain ensigns of the consulship.
      Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his
      grandfather, assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by
      the jealousy of the government, that he was the son of an
      emperor. Sixteen years afterwards he was still alive, but he had
      already been deprived of an eye; and his afflicted mother
      expected every hour, that the innocent victim would be torn from
      her arms, to appease, with his blood, the suspicions of the
      reigning prince. 18

      (including the Cæsar Gallus) who had reigned in his time, only
      two (Constantine and Constantius) died a natural death. Such
      vague consolations have never wiped away a single tear.]

      After the death of Jovian, the throne of the Roman world remained
      ten days, 19 without a master. The ministers and generals still
      continued to meet in council; to exercise their respective
      functions; to maintain the public order; and peaceably to conduct
      the army to the city of Nice in Bithynia, which was chosen for
      the place of the election. 20 In a solemn assembly of the civil
      and military powers of the empire, the diadem was again
      unanimously offered to the præfect Sallust. He enjoyed the glory
      of a second refusal: and when the virtues of the father were
      alleged in favor of his son, the præfect, with the firmness of a
      disinterested patriot, declared to the electors, that the feeble
      age of the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were
      equally incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several
      candidates were proposed; and, after weighing the objections of
      character or situation, they were successively rejected; but, as
      soon as the name of Valentinian was pronounced, the merit of that
      officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly, and obtained
      the sincere approbation of Sallust himself. Valentinian 21 was
      the son of Count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, in Pannonia, who
      from an obscure condition had raised himself, by matchless
      strength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and
      Britain; from which he retired with an ample fortune and
      suspicious integrity. The rank and services of Gratian
      contributed, however, to smooth the first steps of the promotion
      of his son; and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying
      those solid and useful qualifications, which raised his character
      above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers. The person of
      Valentinian was tall, graceful, and majestic. His manly
      countenance, deeply marked with the impression of sense and
      spirit, inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear;
      and to second the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of
      Gratian had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy
      constitution. By the habits of chastity and temperance, which
      restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties, Valentinian
      preserved his own and the public esteem. The avocations of a
      military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of
      literature; 2111 he was ignorant of the Greek language, and the
      arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never
      disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the
      occasion prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with
      bold and ready elocution. The laws of martial discipline were the
      only laws that he had studied; and he was soon distinguished by
      the laborious diligence, and inflexible severity, with which he
      discharged and enforced the duties of the camp. In the time of
      Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace, by the contempt which
      he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; 22 and it should
      seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and
      unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military
      spirit, rather than of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however,
      and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit; 23 and in
      the various events of the Persian war, he improved the reputation
      which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine. The
      celerity and success with which he executed an important
      commission, recommended him to the favor of Jovian; and to the
      honorable command of the second _school_, or company, of
      Targetiers, of the domestic guards. In the march from Antioch, he
      had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly
      summoned, without guilt and without intrigue, to assume, in the
      forty-third year of his age, the absolute government of the Roman
      empire.

      The invitation of the ministers and generals at Nice was of
      little moment, unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army.

      The aged Sallust, who had long observed the irregular
      fluctuations of popular assemblies, proposed, under pain of
      death, that none of those persons, whose rank in the service
      might excite a party in their favor, should appear in public on
      the day of the inauguration. Yet such was the prevalence of
      ancient superstition, that a whole day was voluntarily added to
      this dangerous interval, because it happened to be the
      intercalation of the Bissextile. 24 At length, when the hour was
      supposed to be propitious, Valentinian showed himself from a
      lofty tribunal; the judicious choice was applauded; and the new
      prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple,
      amidst the acclamation of the troops, who were disposed in
      martial order round the tribunal. But when he stretched forth his
      hand to address the armed multitude, a busy whisper was
      accidentally started in the ranks, and insensibly swelled into a
      loud and imperious clamor, that he should name, without delay, a
      colleague in the empire. The intrepid calmness of Valentinian
      obtained silence, and commanded respect; and he thus addressed
      the assembly: “A few minutes since it was in _your_ power,
      fellow-soldiers, to have left me in the obscurity of a private
      station. Judging, from the testimony of my past life, that I
      deserved to reign, you have placed me on the throne. It is now
      _my_ duty to consult the safety and interest of the republic. The
      weight of the universe is undoubtedly too great for the hands of
      a feeble mortal. I am conscious of the limits of my abilities,
      and the uncertainty of my life; and far from declining, I am
      anxious to solicit, the assistance of a worthy colleague. But,
      where discord may be fatal, the choice of a faithful friend
      requires mature and serious deliberation. That deliberation shall
      be _my_ care. Let _your_ conduct be dutiful and consistent.
      Retire to your quarters; refresh your minds and bodies; and
      expect the accustomed donative on the accession of a new
      emperor.” 25 The astonished troops, with a mixture of pride, of
      satisfaction, and of terror, confessed the voice of their master.

      Their angry clamors subsided into silent reverence; and
      Valentinian, encompassed with the eagles of the legions, and the
      various banners of the cavalry and infantry, was conducted, in
      warlike pomp, to the palace of Nice. As he was sensible, however,
      of the importance of preventing some rash declaration of the
      soldiers, he consulted the assembly of the chiefs; and their real
      sentiments were concisely expressed by the generous freedom of
      Dagalaiphus. “Most excellent prince,” said that officer, “if you
      consider only your family, you have a brother; if you love the
      republic, look round for the most deserving of the Romans.” 26
      The emperor, who suppressed his displeasure, without altering his
      intention, slowly proceeded from Nice to Nicomedia and
      Constantinople. In one of the suburbs of that capital, 27 thirty
      days after his own elevation, he bestowed the title of Augustus
      on his brother Valens; 2711 and as the boldest patriots were
      convinced, that their opposition, without being serviceable to
      their country, would be fatal to themselves, the declaration of
      his absolute will was received with silent submission. Valens was
      now in the thirty-sixth year of his age; but his abilities had
      never been exercised in any employment, military or civil; and
      his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine
      expectations. He possessed, however, one quality, which
      recommended him to Valentinian, and preserved the domestic peace
      of the empire; devout and grateful attachment to his benefactor,
      whose superiority of genius, as well as of authority, Valens
      humbly and cheerfully acknowledged in every action of his life.

      Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The
      Empire.—Part II.


      Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he reformed the
      administration of the empire. All ranks of subjects, who had been
      injured or oppressed under the reign of Julian, were invited to
      support their public accusations. The silence of mankind attested
      the spotless integrity of the præfect Sallust; 29 and his own
      pressing solicitations, that he might be permitted to retire from
      the business of the state, were rejected by Valentinian with the
      most honorable expressions of friendship and esteem. But among
      the favorites of the late emperor, there were many who had abused
      his credulity or superstition; and who could no longer hope to be
      protected either by favor or justice. 30 The greater part of the
      ministers of the palace, and the governors of the provinces, were
      removed from their respective stations; yet the eminent merit of
      some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd; and,
      notwithstanding the opposite clamors of zeal and resentment, the
      whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been
      conducted with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation. 31
      The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious
      interruption from the sudden illness of the two princes; but as
      soon as their health was restored, they left Constantinople in
      the beginning of the spring. In the castle, or palace, of
      Mediana, only three miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn
      and final division of the Roman empire. 32 Valentinian bestowed
      on his brother the rich præfecture of the _East_, from the Lower
      Danube to the confines of Persia; whilst he reserved for his
      immediate government the warlike 3211 præfectures of _Illyricum,
      Italy_, and _Gaul_, from the extremity of Greece to the
      Caledonian rampart, and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot
      of Mount Atlas. The provincial administration remained on its
      former basis; but a double supply of generals and magistrates was
      required for two councils, and two courts: the division was made
      with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation, and
      seven master-generals were soon created, either of the cavalry or
      infantry. When this important business had been amicably
      transacted, Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time.
      The emperor of the West established his temporary residence at
      Milan; and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople, to
      assume the dominion of fifty provinces, of whose language he was
      totally ignorant. 33

      The tranquility of the East was soon disturbed by rebellion; and
      the throne of Valens was threatened by the daring attempts of a
      rival whose affinity to the emperor Julian 34 was his sole merit,
      and had been his only crime. Procopius had been hastily promoted
      from the obscure station of a tribune, and a notary, to the joint
      command of the army of Mesopotamia; the public opinion already
      named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of
      natural heirs; and a vain rumor was propagated by his friends, or
      his enemies, that Julian, before the altar of the Moon at Carrhæ,
      had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple. 35 He
      endeavored, by his dutiful and submissive behavior, to disarm the
      jealousy of Jovian; resigned, without a contest, his military
      command; and retired, with his wife and family, to cultivate the
      ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of Cappadocia.
      These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the
      appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers, who, in the
      name of his new sovereigns, Valentinian and Valens, was
      despatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either to a
      perpetual prison or an ignominious death. His presence of mind
      procured him a longer respite, and a more splendid fate. Without
      presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he requested the
      indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family; and
      while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful
      entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the sea-coast of the
      Euxine, from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus.
      In that sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to
      the hardships of exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy
      temper brooding over his misfortunes, and his mind agitated by
      the just apprehension, that, if any accident should discover his
      name, the faithless Barbarians would violate, without much
      scruple, the laws of hospitality. In a moment of impatience and
      despair, Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel, which made sail
      for Constantinople; and boldly aspired to the rank of a
      sovereign, because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a
      subject. At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia,
      continually changing his habitation and his disguise. 36 By
      degrees he ventured into the capital, trusted his life and
      fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a senator and a eunuch,
      and conceived some hopes of success, from the intelligence which
      he obtained of the actual state of public affairs. The body of
      the people was infected with a spirit of discontent: they
      regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who had been
      imprudently dismissed from the præfecture of the East. They
      despised the character of Valens, which was rude without vigor,
      and feeble without mildness. They dreaded the influence of his
      father-in-law, the patrician Petronius, a cruel and rapacious
      minister, who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that
      might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian. The
      circumstances were propitious to the designs of a usurper. The
      hostile measures of the Persians required the presence of Valens
      in Syria: from the Danube to the Euphrates the troops were in
      motion; and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers
      who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus. Two cohorts of
      Gaul were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the
      conspirators; which were recommended by the promise of a liberal
      donative; and, as they still revered the memory of Julian, they
      easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his
      proscribed kinsman. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near
      the baths of Anastasia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple
      garment, more suitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared,
      as if he rose from the dead, in the midst of Constantinople. The
      soldiers, who were prepared for his reception, saluted their
      trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity. Their
      numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy peasants,
      collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, shielded by
      the arms of his adherents, was successively conducted to the
      tribunal, the senate, and the palace. During the first moments of
      his tumultuous reign, he was astonished and terrified by the
      gloomy silence of the people; who were either ignorant of the
      cause, or apprehensive of the event. But his military strength
      was superior to any actual resistance: the malcontents flocked to
      the standard of rebellion; the poor were excited by the hopes,
      and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage;
      and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more
      deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution. The
      magistrates were seized; the prisons and arsenals broke open; the
      gates, and the entrance of the harbor, were diligently occupied;
      and, in a few hours, Procopius became the absolute, though
      precarious, master of the Imperial city. 3611 The usurper
      improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and
      dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumors and opinions the
      most favorable to his interest; while he deluded the populace by
      giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors of
      distant nations. The large bodies of troops stationed in the
      cities of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube, were
      gradually involved in the guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic
      princes consented to supply the sovereign of Constantinople with
      the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries. His
      generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued, without an effort,
      the unarmed, but wealthy provinces of Bithynia and Asia. After an
      honorable defence, the city and island of Cyzicus yielded to his
      power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculeans
      embraced the cause of the usurper, whom they were ordered to
      crush; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new
      levies, he soon appeared at the head of an army, whose valor, as
      well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatness of the
      contest. The son of Hormisdas, 37 a youth of spirit and ability,
      condescended to draw his sword against the lawful emperor of the
      East; and the Persian prince was immediately invested with the
      ancient and extraordinary powers of a Roman Proconsul. The
      alliance of Faustina, the widow of the emperor Constantius, who
      intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of the usurper,
      added dignity and reputation to his cause. The princess
      Constantia, who was then about five years of age, accompanied, in
      a litter, the march of the army. She was shown to the multitude
      in the arms of her adopted father; and, as often as she passed
      through the ranks, the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed
      into martial fury: 38 they recollected the glories of the house
      of Constantine, and they declared, with loyal acclamation, that
      they would shed the last drop of their blood in the defence of
      the royal infant. 39

      In the mean while Valentinian was alarmed and perplexed by the
      doubtful intelligence of the revolt of the East. 3911 The
      difficulties of a German war forced him to confine his immediate
      care to the safety of his own dominions; and, as every channel of
      communication was stopped or corrupted, he listened, with
      doubtful anxiety, to the rumors which were industriously spread,
      that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius sole
      master of the Eastern provinces. Valens was not dead: but on the
      news of the rebellion, which he received at Cæsarea, he basely
      despaired of his life and fortune; proposed to negotiate with the
      usurper, and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the
      Imperial purple. The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and
      ruin by the firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon
      decided in his favor the event of the civil war. In a season of
      tranquillity, Sallust had resigned without a murmur; but as soon
      as the public safety was attacked, he ambitiously solicited the
      preëminence of toil and danger; and the restoration of that
      virtuous minister to the præfecture of the East, was the first
      step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and satisfied the
      minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently
      supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces. But many of
      the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been
      urged, either by motives of duty or interest, to withdraw
      themselves from the guilty scene; or to watch the moment of
      betraying, and deserting, the cause of the usurper. Lupicinus
      advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the
      aid of Valens. Arintheus, who, in strength, beauty, and valor,
      excelled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a
      superior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the
      soldiers who had served under his banner, he commanded them, with
      a loud voice, to seize and deliver up their pretended leader; and
      such was the ascendant of his genius, that this extraordinary
      order was instantly obeyed. 40 Arbetio, a respectable veteran of
      the great Constantine, who had been distinguished by the honors
      of the consulship, was persuaded to leave his retirement, and
      once more to conduct an army into the field. In the heat of
      action, calmly taking off his helmet, he showed his gray hairs
      and venerable countenance: saluted the soldiers of Procopius by
      the endearing names of children and companions, and exhorted them
      no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible
      tyrant; but to follow their old commander, who had so often led
      them to honor and victory. In the two engagements of Thyatira 41
      and Nacolia, the unfortunate Procopius was deserted by his
      troops, who were seduced by the instructions and example of their
      perfidious officers. After wandering some time among the woods
      and mountains of Phyrgia, he was betrayed by his desponding
      followers, conducted to the Imperial camp, and immediately
      beheaded. He suffered the ordinary fate of an unsuccessful
      usurper; but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by the
      conqueror, under the forms of legal justice, excited the pity and
      indignation of mankind. 42

      Such indeed are the common and natural fruits of despotism and
      rebellion. But the inquisition into the crime of magic, 4211
      which, under the reign of the two brothers, was so rigorously
      prosecuted both at Rome and Antioch, was interpreted as the fatal
      symptom, either of the displeasure of Heaven, or of the depravity
      of mankind. 43 Let us not hesitate to indulge a liberal pride,
      that, in the present age, the enlightened part of Europe has
      abolished 44 a cruel and odious prejudice, which reigned in every
      climate of the globe, and adhered to every system of religious
      opinions. 45 The nations, and the sects, of the Roman world,
      admitted with equal credulity, and similar abhorrence, the
      reality of that infernal art, 46 which was able to control the
      eternal order of the planets, and the voluntary operations of the
      human mind. They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and
      incantations, of potent herbs, and execrable rites; which could
      extinguish or recall life, inflame the passions of the soul,
      blast the works of creation, and extort from the reluctant dæmons
      the secrets of futurity. They believed, with the wildest
      inconsistency, that this preternatural dominion of the air, of
      earth, and of hell, was exercised, from the vilest motives of
      malice or gain, by some wrinkled hags and itinerant sorcerers,
      who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt. 47 The
      arts of magic were equally condemned by the public opinion, and
      by the laws of Rome; but as they tended to gratify the most
      imperious passions of the heart of man, they were continually
      proscribed, and continually practised. 48 An imaginary cause was
      capable of producing the most serious and mischievous effects.
      The dark predictions of the death of an emperor, or the success
      of a conspiracy, were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of
      ambition, and to dissolve the ties of fidelity; and the
      intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the actual crimes of
      treason and sacrilege. 49 Such vain terrors disturbed the peace
      of society, and the happiness of individuals; and the harmless
      flame which insensibly melted a waxen image, might derive a
      powerful and pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the
      person whom it was maliciously designed to represent. 50 From the
      infusion of those herbs, which were supposed to possess a
      supernatural influence, it was an easy step to the use of more
      substantial poison; and the folly of mankind sometimes became the
      instrument, and the mask, of the most atrocious crimes. As soon
      as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the ministers of
      Valens and Valentinian, they could not refuse to listen to
      another charge, too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic
      guilt; a charge of a softer and less malignant nature, for which
      the pious, though excessive, rigor of Constantine had recently
      decreed the punishment of death. 51 This deadly and incoherent
      mixture of treason and magic, of poison and adultery, afforded
      infinite gradations of guilt and innocence, of excuse and
      aggravation, which in these proceedings appear to have been
      confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges. They
      easily discovered that the degree of their industry and
      discernment was estimated, by the Imperial court, according to
      the number of executions that were furnished from the respective
      tribunals. It was not without extreme reluctance that they
      pronounced a sentence of acquittal; but they eagerly admitted
      such evidence as was stained with perjury, or procured by
      torture, to prove the most improbable charges against the most
      respectable characters. The progress of the inquiry continually
      opened new subjects of criminal prosecution; the audacious
      informer, whose falsehood was detected, retired with impunity;
      but the wretched victim, who discovered his real or pretended
      accomplices, were seldom permitted to receive the price of his
      infamy. From the extremity of Italy and Asia, the young, and the
      aged, were dragged in chains to the tribunals of Rome and
      Antioch. Senators, matrons, and philosophers, expired in
      ignominious and cruel tortures. The soldiers, who were appointed
      to guard the prisons, declared, with a murmur of pity and
      indignation, that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the
      flight, or resistance, of the multitude of captives. The
      wealthiest families were ruined by fines and confiscations; the
      most innocent citizens trembled for their safety; and we may form
      some notion of the magnitude of the evil, from the extravagant
      assertion of an ancient writer, that, in the obnoxious provinces,
      the prisoners, the exiles, and the fugitives, formed the greatest
      part of the inhabitants. 52

      When Tacitus describes the deaths of the innocent and illustrious
      Romans, who were sacrificed to the cruelty of the first Cæsars,
      the art of the historian, or the merit of the sufferers, excites
      in our breast the most lively sensations of terror, of
      admiration, and of pity. The coarse and undistinguishing pencil
      of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and
      disgusting accuracy. But as our attention is no longer engaged by
      the contrast of freedom and servitude, of recent greatness and of
      actual misery, we should turn with horror from the frequent
      executions, which disgraced, both at Rome and Antioch, the reign
      of the two brothers. 53 Valens was of a timid, 54 and Valentinian
      of a choleric, disposition. 55 An anxious regard to his personal
      safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens.
      In the condition of a subject, he had kissed, with trembling awe,
      the hand of the oppressor; and when he ascended the throne, he
      reasonably expected, that the same fears, which had subdued his
      own mind, would secure the patient submission of his people. The
      favorites of Valens obtained, by the privilege of rapine and
      confiscation, the wealth which his economy would have refused. 56
      They urged, with persuasive eloquence, _that_, in all cases of
      treason, suspicion is equivalent to proof; _that_ the power
      supposes the intention, of mischief; _that_ the intention is not
      less criminal than the act; and _that_ a subject no longer
      deserves to live, if his life may threaten the safety, or disturb
      the repose, of his sovereign. The judgment of Valentinian was
      sometimes deceived, and his confidence abused; but he would have
      silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile, had they
      presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger. They
      praised his inflexible love of justice; and, in the pursuit of
      justice, the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a
      weakness, and passion as a virtue. As long as he wrestled with
      his equals, in the bold competition of an active and ambitious
      life, Valentinian was seldom injured, and never insulted, with
      impunity: if his prudence was arraigned, his spirit was
      applauded; and the proudest and most powerful generals were
      apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier.
      After he became master of the world, he unfortunately forgot,
      that where no resistance can be made, no courage can be exerted;
      and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity,
      he indulged the furious emotions of his temper, at a time when
      they were disgraceful to himself, and fatal to the defenceless
      objects of his displeasure. In the government of his household,
      or of his empire, slight, or even imaginary, offences—a hasty
      word, a casual omission, an involuntary delay—were chastised by a
      sentence of immediate death. The expressions which issued the
      most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were,
      “Strike off his head;” “Burn him alive;” “Let him be beaten with
      clubs till he expires;” 57 and his most favored ministers soon
      understood, that, by a rash attempt to dispute, or suspend, the
      execution of his sanguinary commands, they might involve
      themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience. The
      repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind
      of Valentinian against pity and remorse; and the sallies of
      passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty. 58 He could
      behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture
      and death; he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants
      whose temper was the most congenial to his own. The merit of
      Maximin, who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome, was
      rewarded with the royal approbation, and the præfecture of Gaul.

      Two fierce and enormous bears, distinguished by the appellations
      of _Innocence_, and _Mica Aurea_, could alone deserve to share
      the favor of Maximin. The cages of those trusty guards were
      always placed near the bed-chamber of Valentinian, who frequently
      amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear
      and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were
      abandoned to their rage. Their diet and exercises were carefully
      inspected by the Roman emperor; and when _Innocence_ had earned
      her discharge, by a long course of meritorious service, the
      faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her native
      woods. 59

      But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of Valens
      was not agitated by fear, or that of Valentinian by rage, the
      tyrant resumed the sentiments, or at least the conduct, of the
      father of his country. The dispassionate judgment of the Western
      emperor could clearly perceive, and accurately pursue, his own
      and the public interest; and the sovereign of the East, who
      imitated with equal docility the various examples which he
      received from his elder brother, was sometimes guided by the
      wisdom and virtue of the præfect Sallust. Both princes invariably
      retained, in the purple, the chaste and temperate simplicity
      which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the
      pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh.
      They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of
      Constantius; judiciously adopted and improved the designs of
      Julian and his successor; and displayed a style and spirit of
      legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favorable
      opinion of their character and government. It is not from the
      master of _Innocence_, that we should expect the tender regard
      for the welfare of his subjects, which prompted Valentinian to
      condemn the exposition of new-born infants; 60 and to establish
      fourteen skilful physicians, with stipends and privileges, in the
      fourteen quarters of Rome. The good sense of an illiterate
      soldier founded a useful and liberal institution for the
      education of youth, and the support of declining science. 61 It
      was his intention, that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should
      be taught in the Greek and Latin languages, in the metropolis of
      every province; and as the size and dignity of the school was
      usually proportioned to the importance of the city, the academies
      of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular
      preëminence. The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian
      imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople, which was
      gradually improved by subsequent regulations. That school
      consisted of thirty-one professors in different branches of
      learning. One philosopher, and two lawyers; five sophists, and
      ten grammarians for the Greek, and three orators, and ten
      grammarians for the Latin tongue; besides seven scribes, or, as
      they were then styled, antiquarians, whose laborious pens
      supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the
      classic writers. The rule of conduct, which was prescribed to the
      students, is the more curious, as it affords the first outlines
      of the form and discipline of a modern university. It was
      required, that they should bring proper certificates from the
      magistrates of their native province. Their names, professions,
      and places of abode, were regularly entered in a public register.

      education was limited to the age of twenty. The præfect of the
      city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes
      or expulsion; and he was directed to make an annual report to the
      master of the offices, that the knowledge and abilities of the
      scholars might be usefully applied to the public service. The
      institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of
      peace and plenty; and the cities were guarded by the
      establishment of the _Defensors;_ 62 freely elected as the
      tribunes and advocates of the people, to support their rights,
      and to expose their grievances, before the tribunals of the civil
      magistrates, or even at the foot of the Imperial throne. The
      finances were diligently administered by two princes, who had
      been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private
      fortune; but in the receipt and application of the revenue, a
      discerning eye might observe some difference between the
      government of the East and of the West. Valens was persuaded,
      that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression,
      and his ambition never aspired to secure, by their actual
      distress, the future strength and prosperity of his people.
      Instead of increasing the weight of taxes, which, in the space of
      forty years, had been gradually doubled, he reduced, in the first
      years of his reign, one fourth of the tribute of the East. 63
      Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious
      to relieve the burdens of his people. He might reform the abuses
      of the fiscal administration; but he exacted, without scruple, a
      very large share of the private property; as he was convinced,
      that the revenues, which supported the luxury of individuals,
      would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and
      improvement of the state. The subjects of the East, who enjoyed
      the present benefit, applauded the indulgence of their prince.
      The solid but less splendid, merit of Valentinian was felt and
      acknowledged by the subsequent generation. 64

      But the most honorable circumstance of the character of
      Valentinian, is the firm and temperate impartiality which he
      uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention. His strong
      sense, unenlightened, but uncorrupted, by study, declined, with
      respectful indifference, the subtle questions of theological
      debate. The government of the _Earth_ claimed his vigilance, and
      satisfied his ambition; and while he remembered that he was the
      disciple of the church, he never forgot that he was the sovereign
      of the clergy. Under the reign of an apostate, he had signalized
      his zeal for the honor of Christianity: he allowed to his
      subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself; and they
      might accept, with gratitude and confidence, the general
      toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion, but
      incapable of fear or of disguise. 65 The Pagans, the Jews, and
      all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of
      Christ, were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or
      popular insult; nor was any mode of worship prohibited by
      Valentinian, except those secret and criminal practices, which
      abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and
      disorder. The art of magic, as it was more cruelly punished, was
      more strictly proscribed: but the emperor admitted a formal
      distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which
      were approved by the senate, and exercised by the Tuscan
      haruspices. He had condemned, with the consent of the most
      rational Pagans, the license of nocturnal sacrifices; but he
      immediately admitted the petition of Prætextatus, proconsul of
      Achaia, who represented, that the life of the Greeks would become
      dreary and comfortless, if they were deprived of the invaluable
      blessing of the Eleusinian mysteries. Philosophy alone can boast,
      (and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy,) that
      her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the
      latent and deadly principle of fanaticism. But this truce of
      twelve years, which was enforced by the wise and vigorous
      government of Valentinian, by suspending the repetition of mutual
      injuries, contributed to soften the manners, and abate the
      prejudices, of the religious factions.

      declaration of Valentinian, we may add the various testimonies of
      Ammianus, (xxx. 9,) Zosimus, (l. iv. p. 204,) and Sozomen, (l.
      vi. c. 7, 21.) Baronius would naturally blame such rational

      3, 4.) ——Comme il s’était prescrit pour règle de ne point se

      The friend of toleration was unfortunately placed at a distance
      from the scene of the fiercest controversies. As soon as the
      Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares
      of the creed of Rimini, they happily relapsed into the slumber of
      orthodoxy; and the small remains of the Arian party, that still
      subsisted at Sirmium or Milan, might be considered rather as
      objects of contempt than of resentment. But in the provinces of
      the East, from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais, the
      strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally
      balanced; and this equality, instead of recommending the counsels
      of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war.
      The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives;
      and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows. Athanasius
      still reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of Constantinople and
      Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates, and every episcopal
      vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult. The Homoousians
      were fortified by the reconciliation of fifty-nine Macelonian, or
      Semi-Arian, bishops; but their secret reluctance to embrace the
      divinity of the Holy Ghost, clouded the splendor of the triumph;
      and the declaration of Valens, who, in the first years of his
      reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother, was an
      important victory on the side of Arianism. The two brothers had
      passed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but
      the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of
      baptism, before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic
      war. He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus, 66 6611 bishop of
      the Imperial city; and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by
      that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology, his
      misfortune, rather than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence
      of his erroneous choice. Whatever had been the determination of
      the emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his
      Christian subjects; as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of
      the Arians believed, that, if they were not suffered to reign,
      they were most cruelly injured and oppressed. After he had taken
      this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to
      preserve either the virtue, or the reputation of impartiality. He
      never aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound
      theologian; but as he had received with simplicity and respect
      the tenets of Euxodus, Valens resigned his conscience to the
      direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by the
      influence of his authority, the reunion of the _Athanasian
      heretics_ to the body of the Catholic church. At first, he pitied
      their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy;
      and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object
      of hatred. 67 The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the
      persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or
      imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily
      granted in a despotic court. Such punishments were frequently
      inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party; and the
      misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople, who,
      perhaps accidentally, were burned on shipboard, was imputed to
      the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor, and his Arian
      ministers. In every contest, the Catholics (if we may anticipate
      that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults,
      and of those of their adversaries. In every election, the claims
      of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and if they were
      opposed by the majority of the people, he was usually supported
      by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors
      of a military force. The enemies of Athanasius attempted to
      disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his temporary
      retreat to his father’s sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth
      exile. But the zeal of a great people, who instantly flew to
      arms, intimidated the præfect: and the archbishop was permitted
      to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of
      forty-seven years. The death of Athanasius was the signal of the
      persecution of Egypt; and the Pagan minister of Valens, who
      forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal
      throne, purchased the favor of the reigning party, by the blood
      and sufferings of their Christian brethren. The free toleration
      of the heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented, as a
      circumstance which aggravated the misery of the Catholics, and
      the guilt of the impious tyrant of the East. 68

      (particularly tom. vi. viii. and ix.)]

      The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of
      persecution on the memory of Valens; and the character of a
      prince who derived his virtues, as well as his vices, from a
      feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper, scarcely
      deserves the labor of an apology. Yet candor may discover some
      reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of Valens
      often exceeded the orders, or even the intentions, of their
      master; and that the real measure of facts has been very
      liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy
      credulity of his antagonists. 69 1. The silence of Valentinian
      may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities,
      which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague,
      amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from
      the established system of religious toleration: and the judicious
      historian, who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother,
      has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of
      the West with the cruel persecution of the East. 70 2. Whatever
      credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports, the
      character, or at least the behavior, of Valens, may be most
      distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent
      Basil, archbishop of Cæsarea, who had succeeded Athanasius in the
      management of the Trinitarian cause. 71 The circumstantial
      narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil;
      and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and
      miracle, we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the
      Arian tyrant, who admired the firmness of his character, or was
      apprehensive, if he employed violence, of a general revolt in the
      province of Cappadocia. The archbishop, who asserted, with
      inflexible pride, 72 the truth of his opinions, and the dignity
      of his rank, was left in the free possession of his conscience
      and his throne. The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn
      service of the cathedral; and, instead of a sentence of
      banishment, subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the
      use of a hospital, which Basil had lately founded in the
      neighborhood of Cæsarea. 73 3. I am not able to discover, that
      any law (such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the
      Arians) was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries;
      and the edict which excited the most violent clamors, may not
      appear so extremely reprehensible. The emperor had observed, that
      several of his subjects, gratifying their lazy disposition under
      the pretence of religion, had associated themselves with the
      monks of Egypt; and he directed the count of the East to drag
      them from their solitude; and to compel these deserters of
      society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their
      temporal possessions, or of discharging the public duties of men
      and citizens. 74 The ministers of Valens seem to have extended
      the sense of this penal statute, since they claimed a right of
      enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the Imperial armies.
      A detachment of cavalry and infantry, consisting of three
      thousand men, marched from Alexandria into the adjacent desert of
      Nitria, 75 which was peopled by five thousand monks. The soldiers
      were conducted by Arian priests; and it is reported, that a
      considerable slaughter was made in the monasteries which
      disobeyed the commands of their sovereign. 76

      The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of
      modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the
      clergy, may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor
      Valentinian. His edict, 77 addressed to Damasus, bishop of Rome,
      was publicly read in the churches of the city. He admonished the
      ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and
      virgins; and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of
      the civil judge. The director was no longer permitted to receive
      any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his
      spiritual-daughter: every testament contrary to this edict was
      declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confiscated
      for the use of the treasury. By a subsequent regulation, it
      should seem, that the same provisions were extended to nuns and
      bishops; and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were
      rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts, and
      strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance.
      As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue, Valentinian
      applied this severe remedy to the growing evil. In the capital of
      the empire, the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a
      very ample share of independent property: and many of those
      devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity, not
      only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the
      warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion.
      They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced,
      for the praise of chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal
      society. Some ecclesiastic, of real or apparent sanctity, was
      chosen to direct their timorous conscience, and to amuse the
      vacant tenderness of their heart: and the unbounded confidence,
      which they hastily bestowed, was often abused by knaves and
      enthusiasts; who hastened from the extremities of the East, to
      enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic
      profession. By their contempt of the world, they insensibly
      acquired its most desirable advantages; the lively attachment,
      perhaps of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an
      opulent household, and the respectful homage of the slaves, the
      freedmen, and the clients of a senatorial family. The immense
      fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish
      alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had
      assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole place, in the
      testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed to declare,
      with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that _he_ was only the
      instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor. The
      lucrative, but disgraceful, trade, 78 which was exercised by the
      clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs, had
      provoked the indignation of a superstitious age: and two of the
      most respectable of the Latin fathers very honestly confess, that
      the ignominious edict of Valentinian was just and necessary; and
      that the Christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege,
      which was still enjoyed by comedians, charioteers, and the
      ministers of idols. But the wisdom and authority of the
      legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant
      dexterity of private interest; and Jerom, or Ambrose, might
      patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary
      law. If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal
      emolument, they would exert a more laudable industry to increase
      the wealth of the church; and dignify their covetousness with the
      specious names of piety and patriotism. 79

      Damasus, bishop of Rome, who was constrained to stigmatize the
      avarice of his clergy by the publication of the law of
      Valentinian, had the good sense, or the good fortune, to engage
      in his service the zeal and abilities of the learned Jerom; and
      the grateful saint has celebrated the merit and purity of a very
      ambiguous character. 80 But the splendid vices of the church of
      Rome, under the reign of Valentinian and Damasus, have been
      curiously observed by the historian Ammianus, who delivers his
      impartial sense in these expressive words: “The præfecture of
      Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty, but the
      tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody
      sedition of the distracted people. The ardor of Damasus and
      Ursinus, to seize the episcopal seat, surpassed the ordinary
      measure of human ambition. They contended with the rage of party;
      the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their
      followers; and the præfect, unable to resist or appease the
      tumult, was constrained, by superior violence, to retire into the
      suburbs. Damasus prevailed: the well-disputed victory remained on
      the side of his faction; one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies
      81 were found in the _Basilica_ of Sicininus, 82 where the
      Christians hold their religious assemblies; and it was long
      before the angry minds of the people resumed their accustomed
      tranquillity. When I consider the splendor of the capital, I am
      not astonished that so valuable a prize should inflame the
      desires of ambitious men, and produce the fiercest and most
      obstinate contests. The successful candidate is secure, that he
      will be enriched by the offerings of matrons; 83 that, as soon as
      his dress is composed with becoming care and elegance, he may
      proceed, in his chariot, through the streets of Rome; 84 and that
      the sumptuousness of the Imperial table will not equal the
      profuse and delicate entertainments provided by the taste, and at
      the expense, of the Roman pontiffs. How much more rationally
      (continues the honest Pagan) would those pontiffs consult their
      true happiness, if, instead of alleging the greatness of the city
      as an excuse for their manners, they would imitate the exemplary
      life of some provincial bishops, whose temperance and sobriety,
      whose mean apparel and downcast looks, recommend their pure and
      modest virtue to the Deity and his true worshippers!” 85 The
      schism of Damasus and Ursinus was extinguished by the exile of
      the latter; and the wisdom of the præfect Prætextatus 86 restored
      the tranquillity of the city. Prætextatus was a philosophic
      Pagan, a man of learning, of taste, and politeness; who disguised
      a reproach in the form of a jest, when he assured Damasus, that
      if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome, he himself would
      immediately embrace the Christian religion. 87 This lively
      picture of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth
      century becomes the more curious, as it represents the
      intermediate degree between the humble poverty of the apostolic
      fishermen, and the royal state of a temporal prince, whose
      dominions extend from the confines of Naples to the banks of the
      Po.

      Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The
      Empire.—Part IV.


      When the suffrage of the generals and of the army committed the
      sceptre of the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian, his
      reputation in arms, his military skill and experience, and his
      rigid attachment to the forms, as well as spirit, of ancient
      discipline, were the principal motives of their judicious choice.

      The eagerness of the troops, who pressed him to nominate his
      colleague, was justified by the dangerous situation of public
      affairs; and Valentinian himself was conscious, that the
      abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of
      the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy. As soon as the
      death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of
      his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited
      the nations of the East, of the North, and of the South. Their
      inroads were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable; but,
      during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian, his firmness
      and vigilance protected his own dominions; and his powerful
      genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his
      brother. Perhaps the method of annals would more forcibly express
      the urgent and divided cares of the two emperors; but the
      attention of the reader, likewise, would be distracted by a
      tedious and desultory narrative. A separate view of the five
      great theatres of war; I. Germany; II. Britain; III. Africa; IV.
      The East; and, V. The Danube; will impress a more distinct image
      of the military state of the empire under the reigns of
      Valentinian and Valens.

      I. The ambassadors of the Alemanni had been offended by the harsh
      and haughty behavior of Ursacius, master of the offices; 88 who
      by an act of unseasonable parsimony, had diminished the value, as
      well as the quantity, of the presents to which they were
      entitled, either from custom or treaty, on the accession of a new
      emperor. They expressed, and they communicated to their
      countrymen, their strong sense of the national affront. The
      irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion
      of contempt; and the martial youth crowded to their standard.
      Before Valentinian could pass the Alps, the villages of Gaul were
      in flames; before his general Degalaiphus could encounter the
      Alemanni, they had secured the captives and the spoil in the
      forests of Germany. In the beginning of the ensuing year, the
      military force of the whole nation, in deep and solid columns,
      broke through the barrier of the Rhine, during the severity of a
      northern winter. Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally
      wounded; and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into
      the hands of the conquerors, who displayed, with insulting shouts
      and menaces, the trophy of their victory. The standard was
      recovered; but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their
      disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge. It was the
      opinion of Valentinian, that his soldiers must learn to fear
      their commander, before they could cease to fear the enemy. The
      troops were solemnly assembled; and the trembling Batavians were
      enclosed within the circle of the Imperial army. Valentinian then
      ascended his tribunal; and, as if he disdained to punish
      cowardice with death, he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy
      on the officers, whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to
      be the first occasion of the defeat. The Batavians were degraded
      from their rank, stripped of their arms, and condemned to be sold
      for slaves to the highest bidder. At this tremendous sentence,
      the troops fell prostrate on the ground, deprecated the
      indignation of their sovereign, and protested, that, if he would
      indulge them in another trial, they would approve themselves not
      unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his soldiers. Valentinian,
      with affected reluctance, yielded to their entreaties; the
      Batavians resumed their arms, and with their arms, the invincible
      resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the
      Alemanni. 89 The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus;
      and that experienced general, who had represented, perhaps with
      too much prudence, the extreme difficulties of the undertaking,
      had the mortification, before the end of the campaign, of seeing
      his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive
      advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians. At the
      head of a well-disciplined army of cavalry, infantry, and light
      troops, Jovinus advanced, with cautious and rapid steps, to
      Scarponna, 90 9011 in the territory of Metz, where he surprised a
      large division of the Alemanni, before they had time to run to
      their arms; and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an
      easy and bloodless victory. Another division, or rather army, of
      the enemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent
      country, reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle.
      Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general,
      made a silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he
      could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans.
      Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were
      combing their long and flaxen hair; others again were swallowing
      large draughts of rich and delicious wine. On a sudden they heard
      the sound of the Roman trumpet; they saw the enemy in their camp.
      Astonishment produced disorder; disorder was followed by flight
      and dismay; and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors
      was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and
      auxiliaries. The fugitives escaped to the third, and most
      considerable, camp, in the Catalonian plains, near Châlons in
      Champagne: the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to
      their standard; and the Barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished
      by the fate of their companions, prepared to encounter, in a
      decisive battle, the victorious forces of the lieutenant of
      Valentinian. The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole
      summer’s day, with equal valor, and with alternate success. The
      Romans at length prevailed, with the loss of about twelve hundred
      men. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four thousand were
      wounded; and the brave Jovinus, after chasing the flying remnant
      of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine, returned to
      Paris, to receive the applause of his sovereign, and the ensigns
      of the consulship for the ensuing year. 91 The triumph of the
      Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king,
      whom they hung on a gibbet, without the knowledge of their
      indignant general. This disgraceful act of cruelty, which might
      be imputed to the fury of the troops, was followed by the
      deliberate murder of Withicab, the son of Vadomair; a German
      prince, of a weak and sickly constitution, but of a daring and
      formidable spirit. The domestic assassin was instigated and
      protected by the Romans; 92 and the violation of the laws of
      humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the
      weakness of the declining empire. The use of the dagger is seldom
      adopted in public councils, as long as they retain any confidence
      in the power of the sword.

      While the Alemanni appeared to be humbled by their recent
      calamities, the pride of Valentinian was mortified by the
      unexpected surprisal of Moguntiacum, or Mentz, the principal city
      of the Upper Germany. In the unsuspicious moment of a Christian
      festival, 9211 Rando, a bold and artful chieftain, who had long
      meditated his attempt, suddenly passed the Rhine; entered the
      defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of captives of
      either sex. Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on
      the whole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, with the bands of
      Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, most
      probably on the side of Rhætia. The emperor in person,
      accompanied by his son Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of a
      formidable army, which was supported on both flanks by Jovinus
      and Severus, the two masters-general of the cavalry and infantry
      of the West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devastation of
      their villages, fixed their camp on a lofty, and almost
      inaccessible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and
      resolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The life of
      Valentinian was exposed to imminent danger by the intrepid
      curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and
      unguarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rose from their
      ambuscade: and the emperor, who vigorously spurred his horse down
      a steep and slippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his
      armor-bearer, and his helmet, magnificently enriched with gold
      and precious stones. At the signal of the general assault, the
      Roman troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of Solicinium
      on three different sides. 9212 Every step which they gained,
      increased their ardor, and abated the resistance of the enemy:
      and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the
      hill, they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern
      descent, where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept their
      retreat. After this signal victory, Valentinian returned to his
      winter quarters at Treves; where he indulged the public joy by
      the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games. 93 But the wise
      monarch, instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany, confined
      his attention to the important and laborious defence of the
      Gallic frontier, against an enemy whose strength was renewed by a
      stream of daring volunteers, which incessantly flowed from the
      most distant tribes of the North. 94 The banks of the Rhine 9411
      from its source to the straits of the ocean, were closely planted
      with strong castles and convenient towers; new works, and new
      arms, were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled
      in the mechanical arts; and his numerous levies of Roman and
      Barbarian youth were severely trained in all the exercises of
      war. The progress of the work, which was sometimes opposed by
      modest representations, and sometimes by hostile attempts,
      secured the tranquillity of Gaul during the nine subsequent years
      of the administration of Valentinian. 95

      fecundity of the Alemanni to their easy adoption of strangers.
      ——Note: “This explanation,” says Mr. Malthus, “only removes the
      difficulty a little farther off. It makes the earth rest upon the
      tortoise, but does not tell us on what the tortoise rests. We may
      still ask what northern reservoir supplied this incessant stream
      of daring adventurers. Montesquieu’s solution of the problem
      will, I think, hardly be admitted, (Grandeur et Décadence des
      Romains, c. 16, p. 187.) * * * The whole difficulty, however, is
      at once removed, if we apply to the German nations, at that time,
      a fact which is so generally known to have occurred in America,
      and suppose that, when not checked by wars and famine, they
      increased at a rate that would double their numbers in
      twenty-five or thirty years. The propriety, and even the
      necessity, of applying this rate of increase to the inhabitants
      of ancient Germany, will strikingly appear from that most
      valuable picture of their manners which has been left us by
      Tacitus, (Tac. de Mor. Germ. 16 to 20.) * * * With these manners,
      and a habit of enterprise and emigration, which would naturally
      remove all fears about providing for a family, it is difficult to
      conceive a society with a stronger principle of increase in it,
      and we see at once that prolific source of armies and colonies
      against which the force of the Roman empire so long struggled
      with difficulty, and under which it ultimately sunk. It is not
      probable that, for two periods together, or even for one, the
      population within the confines of Germany ever doubled itself in
      twenty-five years. Their perpetual wars, the rude state of
      agriculture, and particularly the very strange custom adopted by
      most of the tribes of marking their barriers by extensive
      deserts, would prevent any very great actual increase of numbers.

      it was often redundant in population. * * * Instead of clearing
      their forests, draining their swamps, and rendering their soil
      fit to support an extended population, they found it more
      congenial to their martial habits and impatient dispositions to
      go in quest of food, of plunder, or of glory, into other

      That prudent emperor, who diligently practised the wise maxims of
      Diocletian, was studious to foment and excite the intestine
      divisions of the tribes of Germany. About the middle of the
      fourth century, the countries, perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia,
      on either side of the Elbe, were occupied by the vague dominion
      of the Burgundians; a warlike and numerous people, 9511 of the
      Vandal race, 96 whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a
      powerful kingdom, and has finally settled on a flourishing
      province. The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners
      of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their
      civil and ecclesiastical constitution. The appellation of
      _Hendinos_ was given to the king or general, and the title of
      _Sinistus_ to the high priest, of the nation. The person of the
      priest was sacred, and his dignity perpetual; but the temporal
      government was held by a very precarious tenure. If the events of
      war accuses the courage or conduct of the king, he was
      immediately deposed; and the injustice of his subjects made him
      responsible for the fertility of the earth, and the regularity of
      the seasons, which seemed to fall more properly within the
      sacerdotal department. 97 The disputed possession of some
      salt-pits 98 engaged the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent
      contests: the latter were easily tempted, by the secret
      solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor; and their
      fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers, who had formerly been
      left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus, was admitted with
      mutual credulity, as it was conducive to mutual interest. 99 An
      army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks
      of the Rhine; and impatiently required the support and subsidies
      which Valentinian had promised: but they were amused with excuses
      and delays, till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they
      were compelled to retire. The arms and fortifications of the
      Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment; and
      their massacre of the captives served to imbitter the hereditary
      feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni. The inconstancy of a
      wise prince may, perhaps, be explained by some alteration of
      circumstances; and perhaps it was the original design of
      Valentinian to intimidate, rather than to destroy; as the balance
      of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of
      either of the German nations. Among the princes of the Alemanni,
      Macrianus, who, with a Roman name, had assumed the arts of a
      soldier and a statesman, deserved his hatred and esteem. The
      emperor himself, with a light and unencumbered band, condescended
      to pass the Rhine, marched fifty miles into the country, and
      would infallibly have seized the object of his pursuit, if his
      judicious measures had not been defeated by the impatience of the
      troops. Macrianus was afterwards admitted to the honor of a
      personal conference with the emperor; and the favors which he
      received, fixed him, till the hour of his death, a steady and
      sincere friend of the republic. 100

      The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian; but
      the sea-coast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredations
      of the Saxons. That celebrated name, in which we have a dear and
      domestic interest, escaped the notice of Tacitus; and in the maps
      of Ptolemy, it faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric
      peninsula, and three small islands towards the mouth of the Elbe.
      101 This contracted territory, the present duchy of Sleswig, or
      perhaps of Holstein, was incapable of pouring forth the
      inexhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the ocean, who
      filled the British island with their language, their laws, and
      their colonies; and who so long defended the liberty of the North
      against the arms of Charlemagne. 102 The solution of this
      difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners, and loose
      constitution, of the tribes of Germany; which were blended with
      each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship. The
      situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the
      hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates; and the success
      of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of
      their bravest countrymen, who were impatient of the gloomy
      solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float
      down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and
      intrepid associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect
      of the ocean, and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown
      worlds. It should seem probable, however, that the most numerous
      auxiliaries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt
      along the shores of the Baltic. They possessed arms and ships,
      the art of navigation, and the habits of naval war; but the
      difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules
      103 (which, during several months of the year, are obstructed
      with ice) confined their skill and courage within the limits of a
      spacious lake. The rumor of the successful armaments which sailed
      from the mouth of the Elbe, would soon provoke them to cross the
      narrow isthmus of Sleswig, and to launch their vessels on the
      great sea. The various troops of pirates and adventurers, who
      fought under the same standard, were insensibly united in a
      permanent society, at first of rapine, and afterwards of
      government. A military confederation was gradually moulded into a
      national body, by the gentle operation of marriage and
      consanguinity; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the
      alliance, accepted the name and laws, of the Saxons. If the fact
      were not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we
      should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers, by the
      description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to
      sport in the waves of the German Ocean, the British Channel, and
      the Bay of Biscay. The keel of their large flat-bottomed boats
      were framed of light timber, but the sides and upper works
      consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides. 104 In
      the course of their slow and distant navigations, they must
      always have been exposed to the danger, and very frequently to
      the misfortune, of shipwreck; and the naval annals of the Saxons
      were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which
      they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul. But the daring
      spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of
      the shore: their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise;
      the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an
      oar, of rearing a sail, or of conducting a vessel, and the Saxons
      rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which concealed their
      design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy. 105 After they had
      acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the
      West, they extended the scene of their depredations, and the most
      sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security.
      The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily
      proceed fourscore or a hundred miles up the great rivers; their
      weight was so inconsiderable, that they were transported on
      wagons from one river to another; and the pirates who had entered
      the mouth of the Seine, or of the Rhine, might descend, with the
      rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterranean. Under the
      reign of Valentinian, the maritime provinces of Gaul were
      afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was stationed for the
      defence of the sea-coast, or Armorican limit; and that officer,
      who found his strength, or his abilities, unequal to the task,
      implored the assistance of Severus, master-general of the
      infantry. The Saxons, surrounded and outnumbered, were forced to
      relinquish their spoil, and to yield a select band of their tall
      and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies. They stipulated
      only a safe and honorable retreat; and the condition was readily
      granted by the Roman general, who meditated an act of perfidy,
      106 imprudent as it was inhuman, while a Saxon remained alive,
      and in arms, to revenge the fate of their countrymen. The
      premature eagerness of the infantry, who were secretly posted in
      a deep valley, betrayed the ambuscade; and they would perhaps
      have fallen the victims of their own treachery, if a large body
      of cuirassiers, alarmed by the noise of the combat, had not
      hastily advanced to extricate their companions, and to overwhelm
      the undaunted valor of the Saxons. Some of the prisoners were
      saved from the edge of the sword, to shed their blood in the
      amphitheatre; and the orator Symmachus complains, that
      twenty-nine of those desperate savages, by strangling themselves
      with their own hands, had disappointed the amusement of the
      public. Yet the polite and philosophic citizens of Rome were
      impressed with the deepest horror, when they were informed, that
      the Saxons consecrated to the gods the tithe of their _human_
      spoil; and that they ascertained by lot the objects of the
      barbarous sacrifice. 107

      II. The fabulous colonies of Egyptians and Trojans, of
      Scandinavians and Spaniards, which flattered the pride, and
      amused the credulity, of our rude ancestors, have insensibly
      vanished in the light of science and philosophy. 108 The present
      age is satisfied with the simple and rational opinion, that the
      islands of Great Britain and Ireland were gradually peopled from
      the adjacent continent of Gaul. From the coast of Kent, to the
      extremity of Caithness and Ulster, the memory of a Celtic origin
      was distinctly preserved, in the perpetual resemblance of
      language, of religion, and of manners; and the peculiar
      characters of the British tribes might be naturally ascribed to
      the influence of accidental and local circumstances. 109 The
      Roman Province was reduced to the state of civilized and peaceful
      servitude; the rights of savage freedom were contracted to the
      narrow limits of Caledonia. The inhabitants of that northern
      region were divided, as early as the reign of Constantine,
      between the two great tribes of the Scots and of the Picts, 110
      who have since experienced a very different fortune. The power,
      and almost the memory, of the Picts have been extinguished by
      their successful rivals; and the Scots, after maintaining for
      ages the dignity of an independent kingdom, have multiplied, by
      an equal and voluntary union, the honors of the English name. The
      hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinctions
      of the Scots and Picts. The former were the men of the hills, and
      the latter those of the plain. The eastern coast of Caledonia may
      be considered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a
      rude state of tillage, was capable of producing a considerable
      quantity of corn; and the epithet of _cruitnich_, or
      wheat-eaters, expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous
      highlander. The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more
      accurate separation of property, and the habits of a sedentary
      life; but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling
      passion of the Picts; and their warriors, who stripped themselves
      for a day of battle, were distinguished, in the eyes of the
      Romans, by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies
      with gaudy colors and fantastic figures. The western part of
      Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills, which
      scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most
      profitably used for the pasture of cattle. The highlanders were
      condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters; and, as
      they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired
      the expressive name of Scots, which, in the Celtic tongue, is
      said to be equivalent to that of _wanderers_, or _vagrants_. The
      inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of
      food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which intersect their
      country, are plentifully supplied with fish; and they gradually
      ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean. The
      vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattered along the
      western coast of Scotland, tempted their curiosity, and improved
      their skill; and they acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or
      rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea,
      and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the
      well-known stars. The two bold headlands of Caledonia almost
      touch the shores of a spacious island, which obtained, from its
      luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of _Green;_ and has preserved,
      with a slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland.
      It is _probable_, that in some remote period of antiquity, the
      fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots; and
      that the strangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the
      arms of the legions, spread their conquests over the savage and
      unwarlike natives of a solitary island. It is _certain_, that, in
      the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and
      the Isle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots, and that the
      kindred tribes, who were often associated in military enterprise,
      were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual
      fortunes. They long cherished the lively tradition of their
      common name and origin; and the missionaries of the Isle of
      Saints, who diffused the light of Christianity over North
      Britain, established the vain opinion, that their Irish
      countrymen were the natural, as well as spiritual, fathers of the
      Scottish race. The loose and obscure tradition has been preserved
      by the venerable Bede, who scattered some rays of light over the
      darkness of the eighth century. On this slight foundation, a huge
      superstructure of fable was gradually reared, by the bards and
      the monks; two orders of men, who equally abused the privilege of
      fiction. The Scottish nation, with mistaken pride, adopted their
      Irish genealogy; and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings
      have been adorned by the fancy of Boethius, and the classic
      elegance of Buchanan. 111

      authors do not afford any hints of their emigration from another
      country. 2. _That_ all the accounts of such emigrations, which
      have been asserted or received, by Irish bards, Scotch
      historians, or English antiquaries, (Buchanan, Camden, Usher,
      Stillingfleet, &c.,) are totally fabulous. 3. _That_ three of the
      Irish tribes, which are mentioned by Ptolemy, (A.D. 150,) were of

      Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The
      Empire.—Part V.


      Six years after the death of Constantine, the destructive inroads
      of the Scots and Picts required the presence of his youngest son,
      who reigned in the Western empire. Constans visited his British
      dominions: but we may form some estimate of the importance of his
      achievements, by the language of panegyric, which celebrates only
      his triumph over the elements or, in other words, the good
      fortune of a safe and easy passage from the port of Boulogne to
      the harbor of Sandwich. 112 The calamities which the afflicted
      provincials continued to experience, from foreign war and
      domestic tyranny, were aggravated by the feeble and corrupt
      administration of the eunuchs of Constantius; and the transient
      relief which they might obtain from the virtues of Julian, was
      soon lost by the absence and death of their benefactor. The sums
      of gold and silver, which had been painfully collected, or
      liberally transmitted, for the payment of the troops, were
      intercepted by the avarice of the commanders; discharges, or, at
      least, exemptions, from the military service, were publicly sold;
      the distress of the soldiers, who were injuriously deprived of
      their legal and scanty subsistence, provoked them to frequent
      desertion; the nerves of discipline were relaxed, and the
      highways were infested with robbers. 113 The oppression of the
      good, and the impunity of the wicked, equally contributed to
      diffuse through the island a spirit of discontent and revolt; and
      every ambitious subject, every desperate exile, might entertain a
      reasonable hope of subverting the weak and distracted government
      of Britain. The hostile tribes of the North, who detested the
      pride and power of the King of the World, suspended their
      domestic feuds; and the Barbarians of the land and sea, the
      Scots, the Picts, and the Saxons, spread themselves with rapid
      and irresistible fury, from the wall of Antoninus to the shores
      of Kent. Every production of art and nature, every object of
      convenience and luxury, which they were incapable of creating by
      labor or procuring by trade, was accumulated in the rich and
      fruitful province of Britain. 114 A philosopher may deplore the
      eternal discords of the human race, but he will confess, that the
      desire of spoil is a more rational provocation than the vanity of
      conquest. From the age of Constantine to the Plantagenets, this
      rapacious spirit continued to instigate the poor and hardy
      Caledonians; but the same people, whose generous humanity seems
      to inspire the songs of Ossian, was disgraced by a savage
      ignorance of the virtues of peace, and of the laws of war. Their
      southern neighbors have felt, and perhaps exaggerated, the cruel
      depredations of the Scots and Picts; 115 and a valiant tribe of
      Caledonia, the Attacotti, 116 the enemies, and afterwards the
      soldiers, of Valentinian, are accused, by an eye-witness, of
      delighting in the taste of human flesh. When they hunted the
      woods for prey, it is said, that they attacked the shepherd
      rather than his flock; and that they curiously selected the most
      delicate and brawny parts, both of males and females, which they
      prepared for their horrid repasts. 117 If, in the neighborhood of
      the commercial and literary town of Glasgow, a race of cannibals
      has really existed, we may contemplate, in the period of the
      Scottish history, the opposite extremes of savage and civilized
      life. Such reflections tend to enlarge the circle of our ideas;
      and to encourage the pleasing hope, that New Zealand may produce,
      in some future age, the Hume of the Southern Hemisphere.

      abscindere; et has solas ciborum delicias arbitrari. Such is the
      evidence of Jerom, (tom. ii. p. 75,) whose veracity I find no
      reason to question. * Note: See Dr. Parr’s works, iii. 93, where
      he questions the propriety of Gibbon’s translation of this
      passage. The learned doctor approves of the version proposed by a
      Mr. Gaches, who would make out that it was the delicate parts of
      the swine and the cattle, which were eaten by these ancestors of
      the Scotch nation. I confess that even to acquit them of this
      charge. I cannot agree to the new version, which, in my opinion,
      is directly contrary both to the meaning of the words, and the
      general sense of the passage. But I would suggest, did Jerom, as
      a boy, accompany these savages in any of their hunting
      expeditions? If he did not, how could he be an eye-witness of
      this practice? The Attacotti in Gaul must have been in the
      service of Rome. Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal
      propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the
      shepherds of the provinces? These sanguinary trophies of plunder
      would scarce’y have been publicly exhibited in a Roman city or a
      Roman camp. I must leave the hereditary pride of our northern
      neighbors at issue with the veracity of St. Jerom.—M.]

      Every messenger who escaped across the British Channel, conveyed
      the most melancholy and alarming tidings to the ears of
      Valentinian; and the emperor was soon informed that the two
      military commanders of the province had been surprised and cut
      off by the Barbarians. Severus, count of the domestics, was
      hastily despatched, and as suddenly recalled, by the court of
      Treves. The representations of Jovinus served only to indicate
      the greatness of the evil; and, after a long and serious
      consultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of Britain was
      intrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius. The exploits
      of that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been
      celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age:
      but his real merit deserved their applause; and his nomination
      was received, by the army and province, as a sure presage of
      approaching victory. He seized the favorable moment of
      navigation, and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of
      the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians and the Victors. In his
      march from Sandwich to London, Theodosius defeated several
      parties of the Barbarians, released a multitude of captives, and,
      after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil,
      established the fame of disinterested justice, by the restitution
      of the remainder to the rightful proprietors. The citizens of
      London, who had almost despaired of their safety, threw open
      their gates; and as soon as Theodosius had obtained from the
      court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant, and a
      civil governor, he executed, with wisdom and vigor, the laborious
      task of the deliverance of Britain. The vagrant soldiers were
      recalled to their standard; an edict of amnesty dispelled the
      public apprehensions; and his cheerful example alleviated the
      rigor of martial discipline. The scattered and desultory warfare
      of the Barbarians, who infested the land and sea, deprived him of
      the glory of a signal victory; but the prudent spirit, and
      consummate art, of the Roman general, were displayed in the
      operations of two campaigns, which successively rescued every
      part of the province from the hands of a cruel and rapacious
      enemy. The splendor of the cities, and the security of the
      fortifications, were diligently restored, by the paternal care of
      Theodosius; who with a strong hand confined the trembling
      Caledonians to the northern angle of the island; and perpetuated,
      by the name and settlement of the new province of _Valentia_, the
      glories of the reign of Valentinian. 118 The voice of poetry and
      panegyric may add, perhaps with some degree of truth, that the
      unknown regions of Thule were stained with the blood of the
      Picts; that the oars of Theodosius dashed the waves of the
      Hyperborean ocean; and that the distant Orkneys were the scene of
      his naval victory over the Saxon pirates. 119 He left the
      province with a fair, as well as splendid, reputation; and was
      immediately promoted to the rank of master-general of the
      cavalry, by a prince who could applaud, without envy, the merit
      of his servants. In the important station of the Upper Danube,
      the conqueror of Britain checked and defeated the armies of the
      Alemanni, before he was chosen to suppress the revolt of Africa.

      III. The prince who refuses to be the judge, instructs the people
      to consider him as the accomplice, of his ministers. The military
      command of Africa had been long exercised by Count Romanus, and
      his abilities were not inadequate to his station; but, as sordid
      interest was the sole motive of his conduct, he acted, on most
      occasions, as if he had been the enemy of the province, and the
      friend of the Barbarians of the desert. The three flourishing
      cities of Oea, Leptis, and Sobrata, which, under the name of
      Tripoli, had long constituted a federal union, 120 were obliged,
      for the first time, to shut their gates against a hostile
      invasion; several of their most honorable citizens were surprised
      and massacred; the villages, and even the suburbs, were pillaged;
      and the vines and fruit trees of that rich territory were
      extirpated by the malicious savages of Getulia. The unhappy
      provincials implored the protection of Romanus; but they soon
      found that their military governor was not less cruel and
      rapacious than the Barbarians. As they were incapable of
      furnishing the four thousand camels, and the exorbitant present,
      which he required, before he would march to the assistance of
      Tripoli; his demand was equivalent to a refusal, and he might
      justly be accused as the author of the public calamity. In the
      annual assembly of the three cities, they nominated two deputies,
      to lay at the feet of Valentinian the customary offering of a
      gold victory; and to accompany this tribute of duty, rather than
      of gratitude, with their humble complaint, that they were ruined
      by the enemy, and betrayed by their governor. If the severity of
      Valentinian had been rightly directed, it would have fallen on
      the guilty head of Romanus. But the count, long exercised in the
      arts of corruption, had despatched a swift and trusty messenger
      to secure the venal friendship of Remigius, master of the
      offices. The wisdom of the Imperial council was deceived by
      artifice; and their honest indignation was cooled by delay. At
      length, when the repetition of complaint had been justified by
      the repetition of public misfortunes, the notary Palladius was
      sent from the court of Treves, to examine the state of Africa,
      and the conduct of Romanus. The rigid impartiality of Palladius
      was easily disarmed: he was tempted to reserve for himself a part
      of the public treasure, which he brought with him for the payment
      of the troops; and from the moment that he was conscious of his
      own guilt, he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and
      merit of the count. The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to
      be false and frivolous; and Palladius himself was sent back from
      Treves to Africa, with a special commission to discover and
      prosecute the authors of this impious conspiracy against the
      representatives of the sovereign. His inquiries were managed with
      so much dexterity and success, that he compelled the citizens of
      Leptis, who had sustained a recent siege of eight days, to
      contradict the truth of their own decrees, and to censure the
      behavior of their own deputies. A bloody sentence was pronounced,
      without hesitation, by the rash and headstrong cruelty of
      Valentinian. The president of Tripoli, who had presumed to pity
      the distress of the province, was publicly executed at Utica;
      four distinguished citizens were put to death, as the accomplices
      of the imaginary fraud; and the tongues of two others were cut
      out, by the express order of the emperor. Romanus, elated by
      impunity, and irritated by resistance, was still continued in the
      military command; till the Africans were provoked, by his
      avarice, to join the rebellious standard of Firmus, the Moor. 121

      His father Nabal was one of the richest and most powerful of the
      Moorish princes, who acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. But as
      he left, either by his wives or concubines, a very numerous
      posterity, the wealthy inheritance was eagerly disputed; and
      Zamma, one of his sons, was slain in a domestic quarrel by his
      brother Firmus. The implacable zeal, with which Romanus
      prosecuted the legal revenge of this murder, could be ascribed
      only to a motive of avarice, or personal hatred; but, on this
      occasion, his claims were just; his influence was weighty; and
      Firmus clearly understood, that he must either present his neck
      to the executioner, or appeal from the sentence of the Imperial
      consistory, to his sword, and to the people. 122 He was received
      as the deliverer of his country; and, as soon as it appeared that
      Romanus was formidable only to a submissive province, the tyrant
      of Africa became the object of universal contempt. The ruin of
      Cæsarea, which was plundered and burnt by the licentious
      Barbarians, convinced the refractory cities of the danger of
      resistance; the power of Firmus was established, at least in the
      provinces of Mauritania and Numidia; and it seemed to be his only
      doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king, or
      the purple of a Roman emperor. But the imprudent and unhappy
      Africans soon discovered, that, in this rash insurrection, they
      had not sufficiently consulted their own strength, or the
      abilities of their leader. Before he could procure any certain
      intelligence, that the emperor of the West had fixed the choice
      of a general, or that a fleet of transports was collected at the
      mouth of the Rhone, he was suddenly informed that the great
      Theodosius, with a small band of veterans, had landed near
      Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on the African coast; and the timid usurper
      sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius. Though
      Firmus possessed arms and treasures, his despair of victory
      immediately reduced him to the use of those arts, which, in the
      same country, and in a similar situation, had formerly been
      practised by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an
      apparent submission, the vigilance of the Roman general; to
      seduce the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the duration
      of the war, by successively engaging the independent tribes of
      Africa to espouse his quarrel, or to protect his flight.
      Theodosius imitated the example, and obtained the success, of his
      predecessor Metellus. When Firmus, in the character of a
      suppliant, accused his own rashness, and humbly solicited the
      clemency of the emperor, the lieutenant of Valentinian received
      and dismissed him with a friendly embrace: but he diligently
      required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere
      repentance; nor could he be persuaded, by the assurances of
      peace, to suspend, for an instant, the operations of an active
      war. A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of
      Theodosius; and he satisfied, without much reluctance, the public
      indignation, which he had secretly excited. Several of the guilty
      accomplices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient
      custom, to the tumult of a military execution; many more, by the
      amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an
      instructive spectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was
      accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Roman soldiers was
      mingled with respectful admiration. Amidst the boundless plains
      of Getulia, and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas, it was
      impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus; and if the usurper
      could have tired the patience of his antagonist, he would have
      secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude, and
      expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was subdued by the
      perseverance of Theodosius; who had formed an inflexible
      determination, that the war should end only by the death of the
      tyrant; and that every nation of Africa, which presumed to
      support his cause, should be involved in his ruin. At the head of
      a small body of troops, which seldom exceeded three thousand five
      hundred men, the Roman general advanced, with a steady prudence,
      devoid of rashness or of fear, into the heart of a country, where
      he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors. The
      boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians; they
      were disconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats; they
      were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military
      art; and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was
      assumed by the leader of a civilized nation. When Theodosius
      entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen, king of the
      Isaflenses, the haughty savage required, in words of defiance,
      his name, and the object of his expedition. “I am,” replied the
      stern and disdainful count, “I am the general of Valentinian, the
      lord of the world; who has sent me hither to pursue and punish a
      desperate robber. Deliver him instantly into my hands; and be
      assured, that if thou dost not obey the commands of my invincible
      sovereign, thou, and the people over whom thou reignest, shall be
      utterly extirpated.” 12211 As soon as Igmazen was satisfied, that
      his enemy had strength and resolution to execute the fatal
      menace, he consented to purchase a necessary peace by the
      sacrifice of a guilty fugitive. The guards that were placed to
      secure the person of Firmus deprived him of the hopes of escape;
      and the Moorish tyrant, after wine had extinguished the sense of
      danger, disappointed the insulting triumph of the Romans, by
      strangling himself in the night. His dead body, the only present
      which Igmazen could offer to the conqueror, was carelessly thrown
      upon a camel; and Theodosius, leading back his victorious troops
      to Sitifi, was saluted by the warmest acclamations of joy and
      loyalty. 123

      Africa had been lost by the vices of Romanus; it was restored by
      the virtues of Theodosius; and our curiosity may be usefully
      directed to the inquiry of the respective treatment which the two
      generals received from the Imperial court. The authority of Count
      Romanus had been suspended by the master-general of the cavalry;
      and he was committed to safe and honorable custody till the end
      of the war. His crimes were proved by the most authentic
      evidence; and the public expected, with some impatience, the
      decree of severe justice. But the partial and powerful favor of
      Mellobaudes encouraged him to challenge his legal judges, to
      obtain repeated delays for the purpose of procuring a crowd of
      friendly witnesses, and, finally, to cover his guilty conduct, by
      the additional guilt of fraud and forgery. About the same time,
      the restorer of Britain and Africa, on a vague suspicion that his
      name and services were superior to the rank of a subject, was
      ignominiously beheaded at Carthage. Valentinian no longer
      reigned; and the death of Theodosius, as well as the impunity of
      Romanus, may justly be imputed to the arts of the ministers, who
      abused the confidence, and deceived the inexperienced youth, of
      his sons. 124

      If the geographical accuracy of Ammianus had been fortunately
      bestowed on the British exploits of Theodosius, we should have
      traced, with eager curiosity, the distinct and domestic footsteps
      of his march. But the tedious enumeration of the unknown and
      uninteresting tribes of Africa may be reduced to the general
      remark, that they were all of the swarthy race of the Moors; that
      they inhabited the back settlements of the Mauritanian and
      Numidian province, the country, as they have since been termed by
      the Arabs, of dates and of locusts; 125 and that, as the Roman
      power declined in Africa, the boundary of civilized manners and
      cultivated land was insensibly contracted. Beyond the utmost
      limits of the Moors, the vast and inhospitable desert of the
      South extends above a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger.
      The ancients, who had a very faint and imperfect knowledge of the
      great peninsula of Africa, were sometimes tempted to believe,
      that the torrid zone must ever remain destitute of inhabitants;
      126 and they sometimes amused their fancy by filling the vacant
      space with headless men, or rather monsters; 127 with horned and
      cloven-footed satyrs; 128 with fabulous centaurs; 129 and with
      human pygmies, who waged a bold and doubtful warfare against the
      cranes. 130 Carthage would have trembled at the strange
      intelligence that the countries on either side of the equator
      were filled with innumerable nations, who differed only in their
      color from the ordinary appearance of the human species: and the
      subjects of the Roman empire might have anxiously expected, that
      the swarms of Barbarians, which issued from the North, would soon
      be encountered from the South by new swarms of Barbarians,
      equally fierce and equally formidable. These gloomy terrors would
      indeed have been dispelled by a more intimate acquaintance with
      the character of their African enemies. The inaction of the
      negroes does not seem to be the effect either of their virtue or
      of their pusillanimity. They indulge, like the rest of mankind,
      their passions and appetites; and the adjacent tribes are engaged
      in frequent acts of hostility. 131 But their rude ignorance has
      never invented any effectual weapons of defence, or of
      destruction; they appear incapable of forming any extensive plans
      of government, or conquest; and the obvious inferiority of their
      mental faculties has been discovered and abused by the nations of
      the temperate zone. Sixty thousand blacks are annually embarked
      from the coast of Guinea, never to return to their native
      country; but they are embarked in chains; 132 and this constant
      emigration, which, in the space of two centuries, might have
      furnished armies to overrun the globe, accuses the guilt of
      Europe, and the weakness of Africa.

      Empire.—Part VI.


      IV. The ignominious treaty, which saved the army of Jovian, had
      been faithfully executed on the side of the Romans; and as they
      had solemnly renounced the sovereignty and alliance of Armenia
      and Iberia, those tributary kingdoms were exposed, without
      protection, to the arms of the Persian monarch. 133 Sapor entered
      the Armenian territories at the head of a formidable host of
      cuirassiers, of archers, and of mercenary foot; but it was the
      invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negotiation, and to
      consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments
      of regal policy. He affected to praise the prudent and moderate
      conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unsuspicious Tiranus was
      persuaded, by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship, to
      deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy.
      In the midst of a splendid entertainment, he was bound in chains
      of silver, as an honor due to the blood of the Arsacides; and,
      after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana,
      he was released from the miseries of life, either by his own
      dagger, or by that of an assassin. 13311 The kingdom of Armenia
      was reduced to the state of a Persian province; the
      administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a
      favorite eunuch; and Sapor marched, without delay, to subdue the
      martial spirit of the Iberians. Sauromaces, who reigned in that
      country by the permission of the emperors, was expelled by a
      superior force; and, as an insult on the majesty of Rome, the
      king of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal
      Aspacuras. The city of Artogerassa 134 was the only place of
      Armenia 13411 which presumed to resist the efforts of his arms.
      The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the
      avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the wife or widow
      of the Armenian king, excited the public compassion, and animated
      the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers. 13412 The
      Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of
      Artogerassa, by a bold and well-concerted sally of the besieged.
      But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased;
      the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted; the strength
      of the walls yielded to the assault; and the proud conqueror,
      after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword, led away
      captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more auspicious hour, had
      been the destined bride of the son of Constantine. 135 Yet if
      Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent
      kingdoms, he soon felt, that a country is unsubdued as long as
      the minds of the people are actuated by a hostile and
      contumacious spirit. The satraps, whom he was obliged to trust,
      embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of
      their countrymen, and of signalizing their immortal hatred to the
      Persian name. Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians,
      these nations considered the Christians as the favorites, and the
      Magians as the adversaries, of the Supreme Being: the influence
      of the clergy, over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted
      in the cause of Rome; and as long as the successors of
      Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of
      the intermediate provinces, the religious connection always threw
      a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire. A numerous and
      active party acknowledged Para, the son of Tiranus, as the lawful
      sovereign of Armenia, and his title to the throne was deeply
      rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years. By the
      unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally
      divided between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his
      diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his
      regard for his children, who were detained as hostages by the
      tyrant, was the only consideration which prevented him from
      openly renouncing the alliance of Persia. The emperor Valens, who
      respected the obligations of the treaty, and who was apprehensive
      of involving the East in a dangerous war, ventured, with slow and
      cautious measures, to support the Roman party in the kingdoms of
      Iberia and Armenia. 13511 Twelve legions established the
      authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates
      was protected by the valor of Arintheus. A powerful army, under
      the command of Count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the
      Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia. But they
      were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities, which
      might be understood as a breach of the treaty: and such was the
      implicit obedience of the Roman general, that they retreated,
      with exemplary patience, under a shower of Persian arrows till
      they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and
      legitimate victory. Yet these appearances of war insensibly
      subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation. The contending
      parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy
      and ambition; and it should seem, that the original treaty was
      expressed in very obscure terms, since they were reduced to the
      necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial
      testimony of the generals of the two nations, who had assisted at
      the negotiations. 136 The invasion of the Goths and Huns which
      soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire,
      exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor. But the
      declining age, and perhaps the infirmities, of the monarch
      suggested new maxims of tranquillity and moderation. His death,
      which happened in the full maturity of a reign of seventy years,
      changed in a moment the court and councils of Persia; and their
      attention was most probably engaged by domestic troubles, and the
      distant efforts of a Carmanian war. 137 The remembrance of
      ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace. The kingdoms
      of Armenia and Iberia were permitted, by the mutual,though tacit
      consent of both empires, to resume their doubtful neutrality. In
      the first years of the reign of Theodosius, a Persian embassy
      arrived at Constantinople, to excuse the unjustifiable measures
      of the former reign; and to offer, as the tribute of friendship,
      or even of respect, a splendid present of gems, of silk, and of
      Indian elephants. 138

      were defeated by Vasag, the high constable of the kingdom. (See
      M. St. Martin.) But after four years’ courageous defence of his
      kingdom, Arsaces was abandoned by his nobles, and obliged to
      accept the perfidious hospitality of Sapor. He was blinded and
      imprisoned in the “Castle of Oblivion;” his brave general Vasag
      was flayed alive; his skin stuffed and placed near the king in
      his lonely prison. It was not till many years after (A.D. 371)
      that he stabbed himself, according to the romantic story, (St. M.
      iii. 387, 389,) in a paroxysm of excitement at his restoration to

      for fourteen months, till famine and disease had left few
      survivors out of 11,000 soldiers and 6000 women who had taken
      refuge in the fortress. She then threw open the gates with her
      own hand. M. St. Martin adds, what even the horrors of Oriental
      warfare will scarcely permit us to credit, that she was exposed
      by Sapor on a public scaffold to the brutal lusts of his
      soldiery, and afterwards empaled, iii. 373, &c.—M.]

      In the general picture of the affairs of the East under the reign
      of Valens, the adventures of Para form one of the most striking
      and singular objects. The noble youth, by the persuasion of his
      mother Olympias, had escaped through the Persian host that
      besieged Artogerassa, and implored the protection of the emperor
      of the East. By his timid councils, Para was alternately
      supported, and recalled, and restored, and betrayed. The hopes of
      the Armenians were sometimes raised by the presence of their
      natural sovereign, 13811 and the ministers of Valens were
      satisfied, that they preserved the integrity of the public faith,
      if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title
      of King. But they soon repented of their own rashness. They were
      confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Persian monarch.
      They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of
      Para himself; who sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the
      lives of his most faithful servants, and held a secret and
      disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father and
      the enemy of his country. Under the specious pretence of
      consulting with the emperor on the subject of their common
      interest, Para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of
      Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his
      independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court.
      The king of Armenia, for such he appeared in his own eyes and in
      those of his nation, was received with due honors by the
      governors of the provinces through which he passed; but when he
      arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progress was stopped under
      various pretences; his motions were watched with respectful
      vigilance, and he gradually discovered, that he was a prisoner in
      the hands of the Romans. Para suppressed his indignation,
      dissembled his fears, and after secretly preparing his escape,
      mounted on horseback with three hundred of his faithful
      followers. The officer stationed at the door of his apartment
      immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia,
      who overtook him in the suburbs, and endeavored without success,
      to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design. A
      legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive; but the pursuit
      of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light
      cavalry; and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged
      into the air, they retreated with precipitation to the gates of
      Tarsus. After an incessant march of two days and two nights, Para
      and his Armenians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the
      passage of the river which they were obliged to swim, 13812 was
      attended with some delay and some loss. The country was alarmed;
      and the two roads, which were only separated by an interval of
      three miles had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback,
      under the command of a count and a tribune. Para must have
      yielded to superior force, if the accidental arrival of a
      friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of
      escape. A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the
      Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him
      the count and the tribune, while they patiently expected his
      approach along the public highways. They returned to the Imperial
      court to excuse their want of diligence or success; and seriously
      alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a skilful magician,
      had transformed himself and his followers, and passed before
      their eyes under a borrowed shape. 13813 After his return to his
      native kingdom, Para still continued to profess himself the
      friend and ally of the Romans: but the Romans had injured him too
      deeply ever to forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was
      signed in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed
      was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had
      the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the
      credulous prince, that he might find an opportunity of stabbing
      him to the heart Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had
      been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East; the
      hall resounded with cheerful music, and the company was already
      heated with wine; when the count retired for an instant, drew his
      sword, and gave the signal of the murder. A robust and desperate
      Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia; and though he
      bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance
      offered to his hand, the table of the Imperial general was
      stained with the royal blood of a guest, and an ally. Such were
      the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman administration, that, to
      attain a doubtful object of political interest the laws of
      nations, and the sacred rights of hospitality were inhumanly
      violated in the face of the world. 139

      king, (l. iii. c 21, &c., p. 253, &c.) * Note: This note is a
      tissue of mistakes. Tiridates and Para are two totally different
      persons. Tiridates was the father of Gnel first husband of

      V. During a peaceful interval of thirty years, the Romans secured
      their frontiers, and the Goths extended their dominions. The
      victories of the great Hermanric, 140 king of the Ostrogoths, and
      the most noble of the race of the Amali, have been compared, by
      the enthusiasm of his countrymen, to the exploits of Alexander;
      with this singular, and almost incredible, difference, that the
      martial spirit of the Gothic hero, instead of being supported by
      the vigor of youth, was displayed with glory and success in the
      extreme period of human life, between the age of fourscore and
      one hundred and ten years. The independent tribes were persuaded,
      or compelled, to acknowledge the king of the Ostrogoths as the
      sovereign of the Gothic nation: the chiefs of the Visigoths, or
      Thervingi, renounced the royal title, and assumed the more humble
      appellation of _Judges;_ and, among those judges, Athanaric,
      Fritigern, and Alavivus, were the most illustrious, by their
      personal merit, as well as by their vicinity to the Roman
      provinces. These domestic conquests, which increased the military
      power of Hermanric, enlarged his ambitious designs. He invaded
      the adjacent countries of the North; and twelve considerable
      nations, whose names and limits cannot be accurately defined,
      successively yielded to the superiority of the Gothic arms. 141
      The Heruli, who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake Mæotis,
      were renowned for their strength and agility; and the assistance
      of their light infantry was eagerly solicited, and highly
      esteemed, in all the wars of the Barbarians. But the active
      spirit of the Heruli was subdued by the slow and steady
      perseverance of the Goths; and, after a bloody action, in which
      the king was slain, the remains of that warlike tribe became a
      useful accession to the camp of Hermanric.

      He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled in the use of arms,
      and formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide
      extent of the plains of modern Poland. The victorious Goths, who
      were not inferior in numbers, prevailed in the contest, by the
      decisive advantages of exercise and discipline. After the
      submission of the Venedi, the conqueror advanced, without
      resistance, as far as the confines of the Æstii; 142 an ancient
      people, whose name is still preserved in the province of
      Esthonia. Those distant inhabitants of the Baltic coast were
      supported by the labors of agriculture, enriched by the trade of
      amber, and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of
      the Gods. But the scarcity of iron obliged the Æstian warriors to
      content themselves with wooden clubs; and the reduction of that
      wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence, rather than to the
      arms, of Hermanric. His dominions, which extended from the Danube
      to the Baltic, included the native seats, and the recent
      acquisitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the greatest part
      of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror, and
      sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant. But he reigned over a
      part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the
      glory of its heroes. The name of Hermanric is almost buried in
      oblivion; his exploits are imperfectly known; and the Romans
      themselves appeared unconscious of the progress of an aspiring
      power which threatened the liberty of the North, and the peace of
      the empire. 143

      The Goths had contracted an hereditary attachment for the
      Imperial house of Constantine, of whose power and liberality they
      had received so many signal proofs. They respected the public
      peace; and if a hostile band sometimes presumed to pass the Roman
      limit, their irregular conduct was candidly ascribed to the
      ungovernable spirit of the Barbarian youth. Their contempt for
      two new and obscure princes, who had been raised to the throne by
      a popular election, inspired the Goths with bolder hopes; and,
      while they agitated some design of marching their confederate
      force under the national standard, 144 they were easily tempted
      to embrace the party of Procopius; and to foment, by their
      dangerous aid, the civil discord of the Romans. The public treaty
      might stipulate no more than ten thousand auxiliaries; but the
      design was so zealously adopted by the chiefs of the Visigoths,
      that the army which passed the Danube amounted to the number of
      thirty thousand men. 145 They marched with the proud confidence,
      that their invincible valor would decide the fate of the Roman
      empire; and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of
      the Barbarians, who displayed the insolence of masters and the
      licentiousness of enemies. But the intemperance which gratified
      their appetites, retarded their progress; and before the Goths
      could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of
      Procopius, they perceived, by the hostile state of the country,
      that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful
      rival. A chain of posts and fortifications, skilfully disposed by
      Valens, or the generals of Valens, resisted their march,
      prevented their retreat, and intercepted their subsistence. The
      fierceness of the Barbarians was tamed and suspended by hunger;
      they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the
      conqueror, who offered them food and chains: the numerous
      captives were distributed in all the cities of the East; and the
      provincials, who were soon familiarized with their savage
      appearance, ventured, by degrees, to measure their own strength
      with these formidable adversaries, whose name had so long been
      the object of their terror. The king of Scythia (and Hermanric
      alone could deserve so lofty a title) was grieved and exasperated
      by this national calamity. His ambassadors loudly complained, at
      the court of Valens, of the infraction of the ancient and solemn
      alliance, which had so long subsisted between the Romans and the
      Goths. They alleged, that they had fulfilled the duty of allies,
      by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian;
      they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives;
      and they urged a very singular claim, that the Gothic generals
      marching in arms, and in hostile array, were entitled to the
      sacred character and privileges of ambassadors. The decent, but
      peremptory, refusal of these extravagant demands, was signified
      to the Barbarians by Victor, master-general of the cavalry; who
      expressed, with force and dignity, the just complaints of the
      emperor of the East. 146 The negotiation was interrupted; and the
      manly exhortations of Valentinian encouraged his timid brother to
      vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire. 147

      The splendor and magnitude of this Gothic war are celebrated by a
      contemporary historian: 148 but the events scarcely deserve the
      attention of posterity, except as the preliminary steps of the
      approaching decline and fall of the empire. Instead of leading
      the nations of Germany and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or
      even to the gates of Constantinople, the aged monarch of the
      Goths resigned to the brave Athanaric the danger and glory of a
      defensive war, against an enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand
      the powers of a mighty state. A bridge of boats was established
      upon the Danube; the presence of Valens animated his troops; and
      his ignorance of the art of war was compensated by personal
      bravery, and a wise deference to the advice of Victor and
      Arintheus, his masters-general of the cavalry and infantry. The
      operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and
      experience; but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths
      from their strong posts in the mountains; and the devastation of
      the plains obliged the Romans themselves to repass the Danube on
      the approach of winter. The incessant rains, which swelled the
      waters of the river, produced a tacit suspension of arms, and
      confined the emperor Valens, during the whole course of the
      ensuing summer, to his camp of Marcianopolis. The third year of
      the war was more favorable to the Romans, and more pernicious to
      the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of
      the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the
      necessaries of life; and the desolation of a very extensive tract
      of country threatened them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric
      was provoked, or compelled, to risk a battle, which he lost, in
      the plains; and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel
      precaution of the victorious generals, who had promised a large
      reward for the head of every Goth that was brought into the
      Imperial camp. The submission of the Barbarians appeased the
      resentment of Valens and his council: the emperor listened with
      satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the
      senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the first time, a
      share in the public deliberations; and the same generals, Victor
      and Arintheus, who had successfully directed the conduct of the
      war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace. The
      freedom of trade, which the Goths had hitherto enjoyed, was
      restricted to two cities on the Danube; the rashness of their
      leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their
      pensions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated
      in favor of Athanaric alone, was more advantageous than honorable
      to the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occasion,
      appears to have consulted his private interest, without expecting
      the orders of his sovereign, supported his own dignity, and that
      of his tribe, in the personal interview which was proposed by the
      ministers of Valens. He persisted in his declaration, that it was
      impossible for him, without incurring the guilt of perjury, ever
      to set his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more
      than probable, that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was
      confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery.
      The Danube, which separated the dominions of the two independent
      nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference. The emperor
      of the East, and the Judge of the Visigoths, accompanied by an
      equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective
      barges to the middle of the stream. After the ratification of the
      treaty, and the delivery of hostages, Valens returned in triumph
      to Constantinople; and the Goths remained in a state of
      tranquillity about six years; till they were violently impelled
      against the Roman empire by an innumerable host of Scythians, who
      appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the North. 149

      Constantinople to congratulate the victorious emperor; and his
      servile eloquence compares Valens on the Danube to Achilles in
      the Scamander. Jornandes forgets a war peculiar to the
      _Visi_-Goths, and inglorious to the Gothic name, (Mascon’s Hist.
      of the Germans, vii. 3.)]

      The emperor of the West, who had resigned to his brother the
      command of the Lower Danube, reserved for his immediate care the
      defence of the Rhætian and Illyrian provinces, which spread so
      many hundred miles along the greatest of the European rivers. The
      active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding
      new fortifications to the security of the frontier: but the abuse
      of this policy provoked the just resentment of the Barbarians.
      The Quadi complained, that the ground for an intended fortress
      had been marked out on their territories; and their complaints
      were urged with so much reason and moderation, that Equitius,
      master-general of Illyricum, consented to suspend the prosecution
      of the work, till he should be more clearly informed of the will
      of his sovereign. This fair occasion of injuring a rival, and of
      advancing the fortune of his son, was eagerly embraced by the
      inhuman Maximin, the præfect, or rather tyrant, of Gaul. The
      passions of Valentinian were impatient of control; and he
      credulously listened to the assurances of his favorite, that if
      the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were
      intrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus, the emperor should
      no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the
      Barbarians. The subjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany,
      were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister,
      who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his
      superior merit. He affected, however, to receive the modest
      application of Gabinius, king of the Quadi, with some attention
      and regard: but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody
      design, and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the
      pressing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a loss how to vary
      the narrative of similar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the
      course of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire, the
      inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was stained with the
      royal blood of two guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their
      order, and in their presence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para,
      was the same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented
      in a very different manner by the servile temper of the
      Armenians, and the free and daring spirit of the Germans. The
      Quadi were much declined from that formidable power, which, in
      the time of Marcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates of
      Rome. But they still possessed arms and courage; their courage
      was animated by despair, and they obtained the usual
      reenforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies. So
      improvident was the assassin Marcellinus, that he chose the
      moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away, to suppress
      the revolt of Firmus; and the whole province was exposed, with a
      very feeble defence, to the rage of the exasperated Barbarians.
      They invaded Pannonia in the season of harvest; unmercifully
      destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily
      transport; and either disregarded, or demolished, the empty
      fortifications. The princess Constantia, the daughter of the
      emperor Constantius, and the granddaughter of the great
      Constantine, very narrowly escaped. That royal maid, who had
      innocently supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the
      destined wife of the heir of the Western empire. She traversed
      the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train. Her
      person was saved from danger, and the republic from disgrace, by
      the active zeal of Messala, governor of the provinces. As soon as
      he was informed that the village, where she stopped only to dine,
      was almost encompassed by the Barbarians, he hastily placed her
      in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the
      gates of Sirmium, which were at the distance of six-and-twenty
      miles. Even Sirmium might not have been secure, if the Quadi and
      Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general
      consternation of the magistrates and people. Their delay allowed
      Probus, the Prætorian præfect, sufficient time to recover his own
      spirits, and to revive the courage of the citizens. He skilfully
      directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the
      decayed fortifications; and procured the seasonable and effectual
      assistance of a company of archers, to protect the capital of the
      Illyrian provinces. Disappointed in their attempts against the
      walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms
      against the master general of the frontier, to whom they unjustly
      attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring into
      the field no more than two legions; but they contained the
      veteran strength of the Mæsian and Pannonian bands. The obstinacy
      with which they disputed the vain honors of rank and precedency,
      was the cause of their destruction; and while they acted with
      separate forces and divided councils, they were surprised and
      slaughtered by the active vigor of the Sarmatian horse. The
      success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering
      tribes; and the province of Mæsia would infallibly have been
      lost, if young Theodosius, the duke, or military commander, of
      the frontier, had not signalized, in the defeat of the public
      enemy, an intrepid genius, worthy of his illustrious father, and
      of his future greatness. 150

      Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The
      Empire.—Part VII.


      The mind of Valentinian, who then resided at Treves, was deeply
      affected by the calamities of Illyricum; but the lateness of the
      season suspended the execution of his designs till the ensuing
      spring. He marched in person, with a considerable part of the
      forces of Gaul, from the banks of the Moselle: and to the
      suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians, who met him on the way,
      he returned a doubtful answer, that, as soon as he reached the
      scene of action, he should examine, and pronounce. When he
      arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of the
      Illyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity
      under the auspicious government of Probus, his Prætorian præfect.
      151 Valentinian, who was flattered by these demonstrations of
      their loyalty and gratitude, imprudently asked the deputy of
      Epirus, a Cynic philosopher of intrepid sincerity, 152 whether he
      was freely sent by the wishes of the province. “With tears and
      groans am I sent,” replied Iphicles, “by a reluctant people.” The
      emperor paused: but the impunity of his ministers established the
      pernicious maxim, that they might oppress his subjects, without
      injuring his service. A strict inquiry into their conduct would
      have relieved the public discontent. The severe condemnation of
      the murder of Gabinius, was the only measure which could restore
      the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honor of the
      Roman name. But the haughty monarch was incapable of the
      magnanimity which dares to acknowledge a fault. He forgot the
      provocation, remembered only the injury, and advanced into the
      country of the Quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood and
      revenge. The extreme devastation, and promiscuous massacre, of a
      savage war, were justified, in the eyes of the emperor, and
      perhaps in those of the world, by the cruel equity of
      retaliation: 153 and such was the discipline of the Romans, and
      the consternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed the
      Danube without the loss of a single man. As he had resolved to
      complete the destruction of the Quadi by a second campaign, he
      fixed his winter quarters at Bregetio, on the Danube, near the
      Hungarian city of Presburg. While the operations of war were
      suspended by the severity of the weather, the Quadi made an
      humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror; and, at
      the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were
      introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne
      with bended bodies and dejected countenances; and without daring
      to complain of the murder of their king, they affirmed, with
      solemn oaths, that the late invasion was the crime of some
      irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation
      condemned and abhorred. The answer of the emperor left them but
      little to hope from his clemency or compassion. He reviled, in
      the most intemperate language, their baseness, their ingratitude,
      their insolence. His eyes, his voice, his color, his gestures,
      expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury; and while his
      whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion, a large blood
      vessel suddenly burst in his body; and Valentinian fell
      speechless into the arms of his attendants. Their pious care
      immediately concealed his situation from the crowd; but, in a few
      minutes, the emperor of the West expired in an agony of pain,
      retaining his senses till the last; and struggling, without
      success, to declare his intentions to the generals and ministers,
      who surrounded the royal couch. Valentinian was about fifty-four
      years of age; and he wanted only one hundred days to accomplish
      the twelve years of his reign. 154

      Heliodor.) There is much variety of circumstances among them; and
      Ammianus is so eloquent, that he writes nonsense.]

      The polygamy of Valentinian is seriously attested by an
      ecclesiastical historian. 155 “The empress Severa (I relate the
      fable) admitted into her familiar society the lovely Justina, the
      daughter of an Italian governor: her admiration of those naked
      charms, which she had often seen in the bath, was expressed with
      such lavish and imprudent praise, that the emperor was tempted to
      introduce a second wife into his bed; and his public edict
      extended to all the subjects of the empire the same domestic
      privilege which he had assumed for himself.” But we may be
      assured, from the evidence of reason as well as history, that the
      two marriages of Valentinian, with Severa, and with Justina, were
      _successively_ contracted; and that he used the ancient
      permission of divorce, which was still allowed by the laws,
      though it was condemned by the church. Severa was the mother of
      Gratian, who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him
      to the undoubted succession of the Western empire. He was the
      eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the
      free and honorable choice of his fellow-soldiers. Before he had
      attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from
      the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem,
      with the title of Augustus; the election was solemnly ratified by
      the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul; 156 and the name
      of Gratian was added to the names of Valentinian and Valens, in
      all the legal transactions of the Roman government. By his
      marriage with the granddaughter of Constantine, the son of
      Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights of the Flavian
      family; which, in a series of three Imperial generations, were
      sanctified by time, religion, and the reverence of the people. At
      the death of his father, the royal youth was in the seventeenth
      year of his age; and his virtues already justified the favorable
      opinion of the army and the people. But Gratian resided, without
      apprehension, in the palace of Treves; whilst, at the distance of
      many hundred miles, Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of
      Bregetio. The passions, which had been so long suppressed by the
      presence of a master, immediately revived in the Imperial
      council; and the ambitious design of reigning in the name of an
      infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius, who
      commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands. They
      contrived the most honorable pretences to remove the popular
      leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the
      claims of the lawful successor; they suggested the necessity of
      extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies, by a
      bold and decisive measure. The empress Justina, who had been left
      in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio, was
      respectively invited to appear in the camp, with the son of the
      deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death of
      Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only
      four years old, was shown, in the arms of his mother, to the
      legions; and solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the
      titles and ensigns of supreme power. The impending dangers of a
      civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate
      conduct of the emperor Gratian. He cheerfully accepted the choice
      of the army; declared that he should always consider the son of
      Justina as a brother, not as a rival; and advised the empress,
      with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at Milan, in the
      fair and peaceful province of Italy; while he assumed the more
      arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps. Gratian
      dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish, or
      disgrace, the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly
      behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he
      gradually confounded, in the administration of the Western
      empire, the office of a guardian with the authority of a
      sovereign. The government of the Roman world was exercised in the
      united names of Valens and his two nephews; but the feeble
      emperor of the East, who succeeded to the rank of his elder
      brother, never obtained any weight or influence in the councils
      of the West. 157

      In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the
      morning of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the
      Roman world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake.
      The impression was communicated to the waters; the shores of the
      Mediterranean were left dry, by the sudden retreat of the sea;
      great quantities of fish were caught with the hand; large vessels
      were stranded on the mud; and a curious spectator 1 amused his
      eye, or rather his fancy, by contemplating the various appearance
      of valleys and mountains, which had never, since the formation of
      the globe, been exposed to the sun. But the tide soon returned,
      with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge, which was
      severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece,
      and of Egypt: large boats were transported, and lodged on the
      roofs of houses, or at the distance of two miles from the shore;
      the people, with their habitations, were swept away by the
      waters; and the city of Alexandria annually commemorated the
      fatal day, on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives
      in the inundation. This calamity, the report of which was
      magnified from one province to another, astonished and terrified
      the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged
      the real extent of a momentary evil. They recollected the
      preceding earthquakes, which had subverted the cities of
      Palestine and Bithynia: they considered these alarming strokes as
      the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities, and their
      fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a
      declining empire and a sinking world. 2 It was the fashion of the
      times to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will
      of the Deity; the alterations of nature were connected, by an
      invisible chain, with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the
      human mind; and the most sagacious divines could distinguish,
      according to the color of their respective prejudices, that the
      establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake; or that
      a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin
      and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of
      these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself with
      an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that
      man has much more to fear from the passions of his
      fellow-creatures, than from the convulsions of the elements. 3
      The mischievous effects of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane,
      or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very inconsiderable portion
      to the ordinary calamities of war, as they are now moderated by
      the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amuse
      their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their subjects, in
      the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of
      modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished
      soldier; and the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain,
      that his life, or even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of
      war. In the disastrous period of the fall of the Roman empire,
      which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happiness
      and security of each individual were personally attacked; and the
      arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of
      Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the Huns precipitated on the
      provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which advanced, in less
      than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and opened a
      way, by the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many
      hostile tribes, more savage than themselves. The original
      principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the
      North; and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the
      Scythians, 4 or Tartars, 5 will illustrate the latent cause of
      these destructive emigrations.

      The different characters that mark the civilized nations of the
      globe, may be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason;
      which so variously shapes, and so artificially composes, the
      manners and opinions of a European, or a Chinese. But the
      operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of
      reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a
      quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage
      tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of
      animals, preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to
      each other. The uniform stability of their manners is the natural
      consequence of the imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a
      similar situation, their wants, their desires, their enjoyments,
      still continue the same: and the influence of food or climate,
      which, in a more improved state of society, is suspended, or
      subdued, by so many moral causes, most powerfully contributes to
      form, and to maintain, the national character of Barbarians. In
      every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary, have been
      inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose
      indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless
      spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life. In every
      age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their
      invincible courage and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have
      been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North; and
      their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most
      fertile and warlike countries of Europe. 6 On this occasion, as
      well as on many others, the sober historian is forcibly awakened
      from a pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some reluctance,
      to confess, that the pastoral manners, which have been adorned
      with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much
      better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life.
      To illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a
      nation of shepherds and of warriors, in the three important
      articles of, I. Their diet; II. Their habitations; and, III.
      Their exercises. The narratives of antiquity are justified by the
      experience of modern times; 7 and the banks of the Borysthenes,
      of the Volga, or of the Selinga, will indifferently present the
      same uniform spectacle of similar and native manners. 8

      I. The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and
      wholesome food of a civilized people, can be obtained only by the
      patient toil of the husbandman. Some of the happy savages, who
      dwell between the tropics, are plentifully nourished by the
      liberality of nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation
      of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds. The skilful
      practitioners of the medical art will determine (if they are able
      to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be
      affected by the use of animal, or of vegetable, food; and whether
      the common association of carniverous and cruel deserves to be
      considered in any other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a
      salutary, prejudice of humanity. 9 Yet, if it be true, that the
      sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight
      and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe, that the horrid
      objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement,
      are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in
      the tent of a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are
      slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to
      receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are served, with
      very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling
      murderer. In the military profession, and especially in the
      conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of animal food
      appears to be productive of the most solid advantages. Corn is a
      bulky and perishable commodity; and the large magazines, which
      are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops,
      must be slowly transported by the labor of men or horses. But the
      flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars,
      afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far
      greater part of the uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the
      grass is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places so
      extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find
      some tolerable pasture.

      The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing
      appetite, and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They
      indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been
      killed for the table, or have died of disease. Horseflesh, which
      in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilized
      nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with peculiar greediness;
      and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military
      operations. The active cavalry of Scythia is always followed, in
      their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate number of
      spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble
      the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are
      the resources of courage and poverty. When the forage round a
      camp of Tartars is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest
      part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked, or
      dried in the sun. On the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they
      provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of
      cheese, or rather of hard curd, which they occasionally dissolve
      in water; and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many
      days, the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior. But
      this extraordinary abstinence, which the Stoic would approve, and
      the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the most
      voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate
      are the most grateful present, or the most valuable commodity,
      that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their
      industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mare’s
      milk a fermented liquor, which possesses a very strong power of
      intoxication. Like the animals of prey, the savages, both of the
      old and new world, experience the alternate vicissitudes of
      famine and plenty; and their stomach is inured to sustain,
      without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger and
      of intemperance.

      II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of
      soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an
      extensive and cultivated country; and some time must elapse
      before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be assembled
      under the same standard, either to defend their own confines, or
      to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes. The progress of
      manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude
      within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no longer
      soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil
      society, corrupt the habits of the military life. The pastoral
      manners of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages
      of simplicity and refinement. The individuals of the same tribe
      are constantly assembled, but they are assembled in a camp; and
      the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by
      mutual support and emulation. The houses of the Tartars are no
      more than small tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and
      dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of both sexes. The
      palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a size that
      they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons, and drawn by a
      team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds,
      after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the
      approach of night, within the protection of the camp. The
      necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion, in such a
      perpetual concourse of men and animals, must gradually introduce,
      in the distribution, the order, and the guard, of the encampment,
      the rudiments of the military art. As soon as the forage of a
      certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of
      shepherds, makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and thus
      acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life, the
      practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult
      operations of war. The choice of stations is regulated by the
      difference of the seasons: in the summer, the Tartars advance
      towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river,
      or, at least, in the neighborhood of a running stream. But in the
      winter, they return to the South, and shelter their camp, behind
      some convenient eminence, against the winds, which are chilled in
      their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. These
      manners are admirably adapted to diffuse, among the wandering
      tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest. The connection
      between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture,
      that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and
      not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within
      the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his
      property, are always included; and, in the most distant marches,
      he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear, or
      valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the
      fear, or the resentment of injury, the impatience of servitude,
      have, in every age, been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of
      Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries, where they
      might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less
      formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently
      determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile
      nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove,
      and been driven, from the confines of China to those of Germany.
      10 These great emigrations, which have been sometimes executed
      with almost incredible diligence, were rendered more easy by the
      peculiar nature of the climate. It is well known that the cold of
      Tartary is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate
      zone might reasonably be expected; this uncommon rigor is
      attributed to the height of the plains, which rise, especially
      towards the East, more than half a mile above the level of the
      sea; and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is
      deeply impregnated. 11 In the winter season, the broad and rapid
      rivers, that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian,
      or the Icy Sea, are strongly frozen; the fields are covered with
      a bed of snow; and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may
      securely traverse, with their families, their wagons, and their
      cattle, the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain.

      Montesquieu, who has used, and abused, the relations of
      travellers, deduces the revolutions of Asia from this important
      circumstance, that heat and cold, weakness and strength, touch
      each other without any temperate zone, (Esprit des Loix, l. xvii.
      c. 3.)]

      III. The pastoral life, compared with the labors of agriculture
      and manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the
      most honorable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their
      captives the domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure
      is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares. But this
      leisure, instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love
      and harmony, is usefully spent in the violent and sanguinary
      exercise of the chase. The plains of Tartary are filled with a
      strong and serviceable breed of horses, which are easily trained
      for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of every age
      have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant
      practice had seated them so firmly on horseback, that they were
      supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil
      life, to eat, to drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting
      from their steeds. They excel in the dexterous management of the
      lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the
      weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and
      irresistible force. These arrows are often pointed against the
      harmless animals of the desert, which increase and multiply in
      the absence of their most formidable enemy; the hare, the goat,
      the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the
      antelope. The vigor and patience, both of the men and horses, are
      continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase; and the
      plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence, and even
      luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of
      Scythia are not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious
      beasts; they boldly encounter the angry wild boar, when he turns
      against his pursuers, excite the sluggish courage of the bear,
      and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he slumbers in the thicket.
      Where there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode of
      hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor,
      may justly be considered as the image, and as the school, of war.
      The general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar
      princes, compose an instructive exercise for their numerous
      cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to
      encompass the game of an extensive district; and the troops that
      form the circle regularly advance towards a common centre; where
      the captive animals, surrounded on every side, are abandoned to
      the darts of the hunters. In this march, which frequently
      continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills,
      to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without
      interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They
      acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a
      remote object; of preserving their intervals of suspending or
      accelerating their pace, according to the motions of the troops
      on their right and left; and of watching and repeating the
      signals of their leaders. Their leaders study, in this practical
      school, the most important lesson of the military art; the prompt
      and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time. To
      employ against a human enemy the same patience and valor, the
      same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which is
      required in real war; and the amusements of the chase serve as a
      prelude to the conquest of an empire. 12

      The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance
      of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors. The tribes of
      Scythia, distinguished by the modern appellation of _Hords_,
      assume the form of a numerous and increasing family; which, in
      the course of successive generations, has been propagated from
      the same original stock. The meanest, and most ignorant, of the
      Tartars, preserve, with conscious pride, the inestimable treasure
      of their genealogy; and whatever distinctions of rank may have
      been introduced, by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth,
      they mutually respect themselves, and each other, as the
      descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The custom, which
      still prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the
      captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion, that this
      extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and
      fictitious. But the useful prejudice, which has obtained the
      sanction of time and opinion, produces the effects of truth; the
      haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to
      the head of their blood; and their chief, or _mursa_, as the
      representative of their great father, exercises the authority of
      a judge in peace, and of a leader in war. In the original state
      of the pastoral world, each of the _mursas_ (if we may continue
      to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a
      large and separate family; and the limits of their peculiar
      territories were gradually fixed by superior force, or mutual
      consent. But the constant operation of various and permanent
      causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national
      communities, under the command of a supreme head. The weak were
      desirous of support, and the strong were ambitious of dominion;
      the power, which is the result of union, oppressed and collected
      the divided force of the adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquished
      were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory, the most
      valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers
      under the formidable standard of a confederate nation. The most
      successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command, to
      which he was entitled by the superiority, either of merit or of
      power. He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his
      equals; and the title of _Khan_ expresses, in the language of the
      North of Asia, the full extent of the regal dignity. The right of
      hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the
      founder of the monarchy; and at this moment all the Khans, who
      reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the lineal
      descendants of the renowned Zingis. 13 But, as it is the
      indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike
      subjects into the field, the claims of an infant are often
      disregarded; and some royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and
      valor, is intrusted with the sword and sceptre of his
      predecessor. Two distinct and regular taxes are levied on the
      tribes, to support the dignity of the national monarch, and of
      their peculiar chief; and each of those contributions amounts to
      the tithe, both of their property, and of their spoil. A Tartar
      sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and
      as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much
      larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic
      splendor of his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most
      favored of his followers, and to obtain, from the gentle
      influence of corruption, the obedience which might be sometimes
      refused to the stern mandates of authority. The manners of his
      subjects, accustomed, like himself, to blood and rapine, might
      excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of tyranny, as would
      excite the horror of a civilized people; but the power of a
      despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The
      immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits
      of his own tribe; and the exercise of his royal prerogative has
      been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council.
      The Coroulai, 14 or Diet, of the Tartars, was regularly held in
      the spring and autumn, in the midst of a plain; where the princes
      of the reigning family, and the mursas of the respective tribes,
      may conveniently assemble on horseback, with their martial and
      numerous trains; and the ambitious monarch, who reviewed the
      strength, must consult the inclination of an armed people. The
      rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in the
      constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations; but the perpetual
      conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the
      establishment of a powerful and despotic empire. The victor,
      enriched by the tribute, and fortified by the arms of dependent
      kings, has spread his conquests over Europe or Asia: the
      successful shepherds of the North have submitted to the
      confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and the introduction
      of luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people, has
      undermined the foundations of the throne. 15

      The memory of past events cannot long be preserved in the
      frequent and remote emigrations of illiterate Barbarians. The
      modern Tartars are ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors;
      16 and our knowledge of the history of the Scythians is derived
      from their intercourse with the learned and civilized nations of
      the South, the Greeks, the Persians, and the Chinese. The Greeks,
      who navigated the Euxine, and planted their colonies along the
      sea-coast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery of Scythia;
      from the Danube, and the confines of Thrace, as far as the frozen
      Mæotis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which, in
      the language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of
      the earth. They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of
      the pastoral life: 17 they entertained a more rational
      apprehension of the strength and numbers of the warlike
      Barbarians, 18 who contemptuously baffled the immense armament of
      Darius, the son of Hystaspes. 19 The Persian monarchs had
      extended their western conquests to the banks of the Danube, and
      the limits of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of their
      empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia; the wild
      inhabitants of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes, two
      mighty rivers, which direct their course towards the Caspian Sea.
      The long and memorable quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the
      theme of history or romance: the famous, perhaps the fabulous,
      valor of the Persian heroes, Rustan and Asfendiar, was
      signalized, in the defence of their country, against the
      Afrasiabs of the North; 20 and the invincible spirit of the same
      Barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of
      Cyrus and Alexander. 21 In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians,
      the real geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East, by the
      mountains of Imaus, or Caf; and their distant prospect of the
      extreme and inaccessible parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance,
      or perplexed by fiction. But those inaccessible regions are the
      ancient residence of a powerful and civilized nation, 22 which
      ascends, by a probable tradition, above forty centuries; 23 and
      which is able to verify a series of near two thousand years, by
      the perpetual testimony of accurate and contemporary historians.
      24 The annals of China 25 illustrate the state and revolutions of
      the pastoral tribes, which may still be distinguished by the
      vague appellation of Scythians, or Tartars; the vassals, the
      enemies, and sometimes the conquerors, of a great empire; whose
      policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous valor of the
      Barbarians of the North. From the mouth of the Danube to the Sea
      of Japan, the whole longitude of Scythia is about one hundred and
      ten degrees, which, in that parallel, are equal to more than five
      thousand miles. The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be
      so easily, or so accurately, measured; but, from the fortieth
      degree, which touches the wall of China, we may securely advance
      above a thousand miles to the northward, till our progress is
      stopped by the excessive cold of Siberia. In that dreary climate,
      instead of the animated picture of a Tartar camp, the smoke that
      issues from the earth, or rather from the snow, betrays the
      subterraneous dwellings of the Tongouses, and the Samoides: the
      want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the use of
      reindeer, and of large dogs; and the conquerors of the earth
      insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and diminutive
      savages, who tremble at the sound of arms. 26

      Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.—Part II.


      The Huns, who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of
      Rome, had been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the
      empire of China. 27 Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat
      was an extensive, though dry and barren, tract of country,
      immediately on the north side of the great wall. Their place is
      at present occupied by the forty-nine Hords or Banners of the
      Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about two hundred
      thousand families. 28 But the valor of the Huns had extended the
      narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who
      assumed the appellation of _Tanjou_, gradually became the
      conquerors, and the sovereigns of a formidable empire. Towards
      the East, their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean;
      and the tribes, which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and
      the extreme peninsula of Corea, adhered, with reluctance, to the
      standard of the Huns. On the West, near the head of the Irtish,
      in the valleys of Imaus, they found a more ample space, and more
      numerous enemies. One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued,
      in a single expedition, twenty-six nations; the Igours, 29
      distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters, were
      in the number of his vassals; and, by the strange connection of
      human events, the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled
      the victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria. 30 On the
      side of the North, the ocean was assigned as the limit of the
      power of the Huns. Without enemies to resist their progress, or
      witnesses to contradict their vanity, they might securely achieve
      a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia.
      The _Northern Sea_ was fixed as the remote boundary of their
      empire. But the name of that sea, on whose shores the patriot
      Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile, 31 may be
      transferred, with much more probability, to the Baikal, a
      capacious basin, above three hundred miles in length, which
      disdains the modest appellation of a lake 32 and which actually
      communicates with the seas of the North, by the long course of
      the Angara, the Tongusha, and the Jenissea. The submission of so
      many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but
      the valor of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of
      the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South. In the third
      century 3211 before the Christian æra, a wall of fifteen hundred
      miles in length was constructed, to defend the frontiers of China
      against the inroads of the Huns; 33 but this stupendous work,
      which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world, has
      never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people. The
      cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three
      hundred thousand men, formidable by the matchless dexterity with
      which they managed their bows and their horses: by their hardy
      patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather; and by the
      incredible speed of their march, which was seldom checked by
      torrents, or precipices, by the deepest rivers, or by the most
      lofty mountains. They spread themselves at once over the face of
      the country; and their rapid impetuosity surprised, astonished,
      and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese
      army. The emperor Kaoti, 34 a soldier of fortune, whose personal
      merit had raised him to the throne, marched against the Huns with
      those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of
      China. But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians; and, after a
      siege of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was reduced
      to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation. The
      successors of Kaoti, whose lives were dedicated to the arts of
      peace, or the luxury of the palace, submitted to a more permanent
      disgrace. They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms
      and fortifications. They were too easily convinced, that while
      the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the
      Huns, the Chinese troops, who slept with the helmet on their
      head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the
      incessant labor of ineffectual marches. 35 A regular payment of
      money, and silk, was stipulated as the condition of a temporary
      and precarious peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a
      real tribute, under the names of a gift or subsidy, was practised
      by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome. But there
      still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute, which
      violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature. The
      hardships of the savage life, which destroy in their infancy the
      children who are born with a less healthy and robust
      constitution, introduced a remarkable disproportion between the
      numbers of the two sexes. The Tartars are an ugly and even
      deformed race; and while they consider their own women as the
      instruments of domestic labor, their desires, or rather their
      appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty.
      A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually
      devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns; 36 and the alliance of
      the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the
      genuine, or adopted, daughters of the Imperial family, which
      vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution. The
      situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of
      a Chinese princess, who laments that she had been condemned by
      her parents to a distant exile, under a Barbarian husband; who
      complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her only
      food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in a strain of
      pathetic simplicity, the natural wish, that she were transformed
      into a bird, to fly back to her dear country; the object of her
      tender and perpetual regret. 37

      27 (return) [ M. de Guignes (tom. ii. p. 1—124) has given the
      original history of the ancient Hiong-nou, or Huns. The Chinese
      geography of their country (tom. i. part. p. lv.—lxiii.) seems to
      comprise a part of their conquests. * Note: The theory of De
      Guignes on the early history of the Huns is, in general, rejected
      by modern writers. De Guignes advanced no valid proof of the
      identity of the Hioung-nou of the Chinese writers with the Huns,
      except the similarity of name. Schlozer, (Allgemeine Nordische
      Geschichte, p. 252,) Klaproth, (Tableaux Historiques de l’Asie,
      p. 246,) St. Martin, iv. 61, and A. Remusat, (Recherches sur les
      Langues Tartares, D. P. xlvi, and p. 328; though in the latter
      passage he considers the theory of De Guignes not absolutely
      disproved,) concur in considering the Huns as belonging to the
      Finnish stock, distinct from the Moguls the Mandscheus, and the
      Turks. The Hiong-nou, according to Klaproth, were Turks. The
      names of the Hunnish chiefs could not be pronounced by a Turk;
      and, according to the same author, the Hioung-nou, which is
      explained in Chinese as _detestable slaves_, as early as the year
      91 J. C., were dispersed by the Chinese, and assumed the name of
      Yue-po or Yue-pan. M. St. Martin does not consider it impossible
      that the appellation of Hioung-nou may have belonged to the Huns.
      But all agree in considering the Madjar or Magyar of modern
      Hungary the descendants of the Huns. Their language (compare
      Gibbon, c. lv. n. 22) is nearly related to the Lapponian and
      Vogoul. The noble forms of the modern Hungarians, so strongly
      contrasted with the hideous pictures which the fears and the
      hatred of the Romans give of the Huns, M. Klaproth accounts for
      by the intermingling with other races, Turkish and Slavonian. The
      present state of the question is thus stated in the last edition
      of Malte Brun, and a new and ingenious hypothesis suggested to
      resolve all the difficulties of the question.
          Were the Huns Finns? This obscure question has not been
          debated till very recently, and is yet very far from being
          decided. We are of opinion that it will be so hereafter in
          the same manner as that with regard to the Scythians. We
          shall trace in the portrait of Attila a dominant tribe or
          Mongols, or Kalmucks, with all the hereditary ugliness of
          that race; but in the mass of the Hunnish army and nation
          will be recognized the Chuni and the Ounni of the Greek
          Geography. the Kuns of the Hungarians, the European Huns, and
          a race in close relationship with the Flemish stock. Malte

          developed, p. 743. Whoever has seen the emperor of Austria’s

      The conquest of China has been twice achieved by the pastoral
      tribes of the North: the forces of the Huns were not inferior to
      those of the Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux; and their ambition
      might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success. But their
      pride was humbled, and their progress was checked, by the arms
      and policy of Vouti, 38 the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty
      of the Han. In his long reign of fifty- four years, the
      Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and
      manners of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were
      enlarged, from the great river of Kiang, to the port of Canton.
      Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a
      defensive war, his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into
      the country of the Huns. In those boundless deserts, where it is
      impossible to form magazines, and difficult to transport a
      sufficient supply of provisions, the armies of Vouti were
      repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of one hundred
      and forty thousand soldiers, who marched against the Barbarians,
      thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their
      master. These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and
      decisive success. The Chinese generals improved the superiority
      which they derived from the temper of their arms, their chariots
      of war, and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries. The camp of
      the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance;
      and, though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through
      the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thousand of his
      subjects on the field of battle. Yet this signal victory, which
      was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed
      much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the
      effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary
      nations from their obedience. Intimidated by the arms, or allured
      by the promises, of Vouti and his successors, the most
      considerable tribes, both of the East and of the West, disclaimed
      the authority of the Tanjou. While some acknowledged themselves
      the allies or vassals of the empire, they all became the
      implacable enemies of the Huns; and the numbers of that haughty
      people, as soon as they were reduced to their native strength,
      might, perhaps, have been contained within the walls of one of
      the great and populous cities of China. 39 The desertion of his
      subjects, and the perplexity of a civil war, at length compelled
      the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an independent
      sovereign, and the freedom of a warlike and high-spirited nation.
      He was received at Sigan, the capital of the monarchy, by the
      troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with all the
      honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese
      vanity. 40 A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception;
      his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family;
      and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the
      ceremonies of a banquet, which consisted of eight courses of
      meat, and of nine solemn pieces of music. But he performed, on
      his knees, the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of
      China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his
      successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted
      a seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence.
      After this humiliating submission, the Tanjous sometimes departed
      from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and
      rapine; but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined, till it
      was broken, by civil dissension, into two hostile and separate
      kingdoms. One of the princes of the nation was urged, by fear and
      ambition, to retire towards the South with eight hords, which
      composed between forty and fifty thousand families. He obtained,
      with the title of Tanjou, a convenient territory on the verge of
      the Chinese provinces; and his constant attachment to the service
      of the empire was secured by weakness, and the desire of revenge.
      From the time of this fatal schism, the Huns of the North
      continued to languish about fifty years; till they were oppressed
      on every side by their foreign and domestic enemies. The proud
      inscription 41 of a column, erected on a lofty mountain,
      announced to posterity, that a Chinese army had marched seven
      hundred miles into the heart of their country. The Sienpi, 42 a
      tribe of Oriental Tartars, retaliated the injuries which they had
      formerly sustained; and the power of the Tanjous, after a reign
      of thirteen hundred years, was utterly destroyed before the end
      of the first century of the Christian æra. 43

      123.)]

      The fate of the vanquished Huns was diversified by the various
      influence of character and situation. 44 Above one hundred
      thousand persons, the poorest, indeed, and the most pusillanimous
      of the people, were contented to remain in their native country,
      to renounce their peculiar name and origin, and to mingle with
      the victorious nation of the Sienpi. Fifty-eight hords, about two
      hundred thousand men, ambitious of a more honorable servitude,
      retired towards the South; implored the protection of the
      emperors of China; and were permitted to inhabit, and to guard,
      the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and the territory
      of Ortous. But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns
      maintained, in their adverse fortune, the undaunted spirit of
      their ancestors. The Western world was open to their valor; and
      they resolved, under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains,
      to conquer and subdue some remote country, which was still
      inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi, and to the laws of China.
      45 The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the
      mountains of Imaus, and the limits of the Chinese geography; but
      _we_ are able to distinguish the two great divisions of these
      formidable exiles, which directed their march towards the Oxus,
      and towards the Volga. The first of these colonies established
      their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana,
      on the eastern side of the Caspian; where they preserved the name
      of Huns, with the epithet of Euthalites, or Nepthalites. 4511
      Their manners were softened, and even their features were
      insensibly improved, by the mildness of the climate, and their
      long residence in a flourishing province, 46 which might still
      retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece. 47 The _white_
      Huns, a name which they derived from the change of their
      complexions, soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia. Gorgo,
      which, under the appellation of Carizme, has since enjoyed a
      temporary splendor, was the residence of the king, who exercised
      a legal authority over an obedient people. Their luxury was
      maintained by the labor of the Sogdians; and the only vestige of
      their ancient barbarism, was the custom which obliged all the
      companions, perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the
      liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same
      grave. 48 The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia,
      involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of
      that monarchy. But they respected, in peace, the faith of
      treaties; in war, the dictates of humanity; and their memorable
      victory over Peroses, or Firuz, displayed the moderation, as well
      as the valor, of the Barbarians. The _second_ division of their
      countrymen, the Huns, who gradually advanced towards the
      North-west, were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate,
      and a more laborious march. Necessity compelled them to exchange
      the silks of China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect
      rudiments of civilized life were obliterated; and the native
      fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with
      the savage tribes, who were compared, with some propriety, to the
      wild beasts of the desert. Their independent spirit soon rejected
      the hereditary succession of the Tanjous; and while each horde
      was governed by its peculiar mursa, their tumultuary council
      directed the public measures of the whole nation. As late as the
      thirteenth century, their transient residence on the eastern
      banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary. 49
      In the winter, they descended with their flocks and herds towards
      the mouth of that mighty river; and their summer excursions
      reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the
      conflux of the Kama. Such at least were the recent limits of the
      black Calmucks, 50 who remained about a century under the
      protection of Russia; and who have since returned to their native
      seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire. The march, and the
      return, of those wandering Tartars, whose united camp consists of
      fifty thousand tents or families, illustrate the distant
      emigrations of the ancient Huns. 51

      It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time, which
      elapsed, after the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the
      Chinese, and before they showed themselves to those of the
      Romans. There is some reason, however, to apprehend, that the
      same force which had driven them from their native seats, still
      continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe.
      The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies, which extended
      above three thousand miles from East to West, 52 must have
      gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable
      neighborhood; and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would
      inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the
      territories, of the Huns. The harsh and obscure appellations of
      those tribes would offend the ear, without informing the
      understanding, of the reader; but I cannot suppress the very
      natural suspicion, _that_ the Huns of the North derived a
      considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the
      South, which, in the course of the third century, submitted to
      the dominion of China; _that_ the bravest warriors marched away
      in search of their free and adventurous countrymen; _and_ that,
      as they had been divided by prosperity, they were easily reunited
      by the common hardships of their adverse fortune. 53 The Huns,
      with their flocks and herds, their wives and children, their
      dependents and allies, were transported to the west of the Volga,
      and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani, a
      pastoral people, who occupied, or wasted, an extensive tract of
      the deserts of Scythia. The plains between the Volga and the
      Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name
      and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their
      conquests; and the painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni
      were confounded among their vassals. Towards the North, they
      penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the savages
      who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taste of
      human flesh; and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the
      confines of Persia and India. The mixture of Samartic and German
      blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani, 5311
      to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with
      a yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tartar race. They
      were less deformed in their persons, less brutish in their
      manners, than the Huns; but they did not yield to those
      formidable Barbarians in their martial and independent spirit; in
      the love of freedom, which rejected even the use of domestic
      slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war and rapine
      as the pleasure and the glory of mankind. A naked cimeter, fixed
      in the ground, was the only object of their religious worship;
      the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their
      horses; and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the
      pusillanimous warriors, who patiently expected the infirmities of
      age, and the tortures of lingering disease. 54 On the banks of
      the Tanais, the military power of the Huns and the Alani
      encountered each other with equal valor, but with unequal
      success. The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest; the king of
      the Alani was slain; and the remains of the vanquished nation
      were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or
      submission. 55 A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the
      mountains of Caucasus, between the Euxine and the Caspian, where
      they still preserve their name and their independence. Another
      colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores
      of the Baltic; associated themselves with the Northern tribes of
      Germany; and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and
      Spain. But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced
      the offers of an honorable and advantageous union; and the Huns,
      who esteemed the valor of their less fortunate enemies,
      proceeded, with an increase of numbers and confidence, to invade
      the limits of the Gothic empire.

      The great Hermanric, whose dominions extended from the Baltic to
      the Euxine, enjoyed, in the full maturity of age and reputation,
      the fruit of his victories, when he was alarmed by the formidable
      approach of a host of unknown enemies, 56 on whom his barbarous
      subjects might, without injustice, bestow the epithet of
      Barbarians. The numbers, the strength, the rapid motions, and the
      implacable cruelty of the Huns, were felt, and dreaded, and
      magnified, by the astonished Goths; who beheld their fields and
      villages consumed with flames, and deluged with indiscriminate
      slaughter. To these real terrors they added the surprise and
      abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth
      gestures, and the strange deformity of the Huns. 5611 These
      savages of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some
      resemblance) to the animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs
      and to the misshapen figures, the _Termini_, which were often
      placed on the bridges of antiquity. They were distinguished from
      the rest of the human species by their broad shoulders, flat
      noses, and small black eyes, deeply buried in the head; and as
      they were almost destitute of beards, they never enjoyed either
      the manly grace of youth, or the venerable aspect of age. 57 A
      fabulous origin was assigned, worthy of their form and manners;
      that the witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly
      practices, had been driven from society, had copulated in the
      desert with infernal spirits; and that the Huns were the
      offspring of this execrable conjunction. 58 The tale, so full of
      horror and absurdity, was greedily embraced by the credulous
      hatred of the Goths; but, while it gratified their hatred, it
      increased their fear, since the posterity of dæmons and witches
      might be supposed to inherit some share of the præternatural
      powers, as well as of the malignant temper, of their parents.
      Against these enemies, Hermanric prepared to exert the united
      forces of the Gothic state; but he soon discovered that his
      vassal tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to
      second, than to repel, the invasion of the Huns. One of the
      chiefs of the Roxolani 59 had formerly deserted the standard of
      Hermanric, and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife
      of the traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses. The brothers of
      that unfortunate woman seized the favorable moment of revenge.

      The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the
      dangerous wound which he received from their daggers; but the
      conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities; and the
      public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of
      jealousy and discord. His death, which has been imputed to his
      own despair, left the reins of government in the hands of
      Withimer, who, with the doubtful aid of some Scythian
      mercenaries, maintained the unequal contest against the arms of
      the Huns and the Alani, till he was defeated and slain in a
      decisive battle. The Ostrogoths submitted to their fate; and the
      royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the
      subjects of the haughty Attila. But the person of Witheric, the
      infant king, was saved by the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax;
      two warriors of approved valor and fiedlity, who, by cautious
      marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the
      Ostrogoths towards the Danastus, or Niester; a considerable
      river, which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire
      of Russia. On the banks of the Niester, the prudent Athanaric,
      more attentive to his own than to the general safety, had fixed
      the camp of the Visigoths; with the firm resolution of opposing
      the victorious Barbarians, whom he thought it less advisable to
      provoke. The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the weight
      of baggage, and the encumbrance of captives; but their military
      skill deceived, and almost destroyed, the army of Athanaric.
      While the Judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the
      Niester, he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment
      of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had passed the river
      in a fordable place; and it was not without the utmost efforts of
      courage and conduct, that he was able to effect his retreat
      towards the hilly country. The undaunted general had already
      formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war; and the strong
      lines, which he was preparing to construct between the mountains,
      the Pruth, and the Danube, would have secured the extensive and
      fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia, from
      the destructive inroads of the Huns. 60 But the hopes and
      measures of the Judge of the Visigoths was soon disappointed, by
      the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen; who were
      persuaded by their fears, that the interposition of the Danube
      was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit,
      and invincible valor, of the Barbarians of Scythia. Under the
      command of Fritigern and Alavivus, 61 the body of the nation
      hastily advanced to the banks of the great river, and implored
      the protection of the Roman emperor of the East. Athanaric
      himself, still anxious to avoid the guilt of perjury, retired,
      with a band of faithful followers, into the mountainous country
      of Caucaland; which appears to have been guarded, and almost
      concealed, by the impenetrable forests of Transylvania. 62 6211

      Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.—Part III.


      After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance
      of glory and success, he made a progress through his dominions of
      Asia, and at length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria.
      The five years 63 which he spent at Antioch was employed to
      watch, from a secure distance, the hostile designs of the Persian
      monarch; to check the depredations of the Saracens and Isaurians;
      64 to enforce, by arguments more prevalent than those of reason
      and eloquence, the belief of the Arian theology; and to satisfy
      his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the
      innocent and the guilty. But the attention of the emperor was
      most seriously engaged, by the important intelligence which he
      received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted
      with the defence of the Danube. He was informed, that the North
      was agitated by a furious tempest; that the irruption of the
      Huns, an unknown and monstrous race of savages, had subverted the
      power of the Goths; and that the suppliant multitudes of that
      warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the dust, covered
      a space of many miles along the banks of the river. With
      outstretched arms, and pathetic lamentations, they loudly
      deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger;
      acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency
      of the Roman government; and most solemnly protested, that if the
      gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate
      the waste lands of Thrace, they should ever hold themselves
      bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude, to
      obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. These
      assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, 6411
      who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that
      must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The
      emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and
      authority of his elder brother, whose death happened towards the
      end of the preceding year; and as the distressful situation of
      the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision, he was
      deprived of the favorite resources of feeble and timid minds, who
      consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most
      admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long as the same
      passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions of
      war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the
      councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the
      subject of modern deliberation. But the most experienced
      statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the
      propriety, or the danger, of admitting, or rejecting, an
      innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven by despair
      and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a
      civilized nation. When that important proposition, so essentially
      connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers
      of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon
      acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most
      favorable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their
      sovereign. The slaves, who were decorated with the titles of
      præfects and generals, dissembled or disregarded the terrors of
      this national emigration; so extremely different from the partial
      and accidental colonies, which had been received on the extreme
      limits of the empire. But they applauded the liberality of
      fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant countries of
      the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to defend
      the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures
      the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to
      compensate their annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of
      the Goths were granted, and their service was accepted by the
      Imperial court: and orders were immediately despatched to the
      civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese, to make the
      necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great
      people, till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted
      for their future residence. The liberality of the emperor was
      accompanied, however, with two harsh and rigorous conditions,
      which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but which
      distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they
      passed the Danube, they were required to deliver their arms: and
      it was insisted, that their children should be taken from them,
      and dispersed through the provinces of Asia; where they might be
      civilized by the arts of education, and serve as hostages to
      secure the fidelity of their parents.

      During the suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation, the
      impatient Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube,
      without the permission of the government, whose protection they
      had implored. Their motions were strictly observed by the
      vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river and
      their foremost detachments were defeated with considerable
      slaughter; yet such were the timid councils of the reign of
      Valens, that the brave officers who had served their country in
      the execution of their duty, were punished by the loss of their
      employments, and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads. The
      Imperial mandate was at length received for transporting over the
      Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation; 65 but the execution
      of this order was a task of labor and difficulty. The stream of
      the Danube, which in those parts is above a mile broad, 66 had
      been swelled by incessant rains; and in this tumultuous passage,
      many were swept away, and drowned, by the rapid violence of the
      current. A large fleet of vessels, of boats, and of canoes, was
      provided; many days and nights they passed and repassed with
      indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence was exerted
      by the officers of Valens, that not a single Barbarian, of those
      who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be
      left on the opposite shore. It was thought expedient that an
      accurate account should be taken of their numbers; but the
      persons who were employed soon desisted, with amazement and
      dismay, from the prosecution of the endless and impracticable
      task: 67 and the principal historian of the age most seriously
      affirms, that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes, which
      had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous
      antiquity, were now justified, in the eyes of mankind, by the
      evidence of fact and experience. A probable testimony has fixed
      the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men:
      and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women, of
      children, and of slaves, the whole mass of people which composed
      this formidable emigration, must have amounted to near a million
      of persons, of both sexes, and of all ages. The children of the
      Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank, were separated
      from the multitude. They were conducted, without delay, to the
      distant seats assigned for their residence and education; and as
      the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the
      cities, their gay and splendid apparel, their robust and martial
      figure, excited the surprise and envy of the Provincials. 6711
      But the stipulation, the most offensive to the Goths, and the
      most important to the Romans, was shamefully eluded. The
      Barbarians, who considered their arms as the ensigns of honor and
      the pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a price, which the
      lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to
      accept. To preserve their arms, the haughty warriors consented,
      with some reluctance, to prostitute their wives or their
      daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy,
      secured the connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes cast an
      eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of
      their new allies, 68 or who sacrificed their duty to the mean
      consideration of filling their farms with cattle, and their
      houses with slaves. The Goths, with arms in their hands, were
      permitted to enter the boats; and when their strength was
      collected on the other side of the river, the immense camp which
      was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Mæsia,
      assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect. The leaders of the
      Ostrogoths, Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant
      king, appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the
      Danube; and immediately despatched their ambassadors to the court
      of Antioch, to solicit, with the same professions of allegiance
      and gratitude, the same favor which had been granted to the
      suppliant Visigoths. The absolute refusal of Valens suspended
      their progress, and discovered the repentance, the suspicions,
      and the fears, of the Imperial council.

      transported over the river their native deities, with their
      priests of both sexes; but concerning their rites they maintained
      a deep and ‘_adamantine_ silence.’ To the Romans they pretended
      to be generally Christians, and placed certain persons to
      represent bishops in a conspicuous manner on their wagons. There
      was even among them a sort of what are called monks, persons whom
      it was not difficult to mimic; it was enough to wear black
      raiment, to be wicked, and held in respect.” (Eunapius hated the
      “black-robed monks,” as appears in another passage, with the
      cordial detestation of a heathen philosopher.) “Thus, while they
      faithfully but secretly adhered to their own religion, the Romans
      were weak enough to suppose them perfect Christians.” Mai, 277.

      68 (return) [ Eunapius and Zosimus curiously specify these
      articles of Gothic wealth and luxury. Yet it must be presumed,
      that they were the manufactures of the provinces; which the
      Barbarians had acquired as the spoils of war; or as the gifts, or
      merchandise, of peace.]

      An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians required the
      firmest temper, and the most dexterous management. The daily
      subsistence of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be
      supplied only by constant and skilful diligence, and might
      continually be interrupted by mistake or accident. The insolence,
      or the indignation, of the Goths, if they conceived themselves to
      be the objects either of fear or of contempt, might urge them to
      the most desperate extremities; and the fortune of the state
      seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the integrity, of
      the generals of Valens. At this important crisis, the military
      government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in
      whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument
      outweighed every consideration of public advantage; and whose
      guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the
      pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration.

      Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying,
      with decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an
      ungenerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry
      Barbarians. The vilest food was sold at an extravagant price;
      and, in the room of wholesome and substantial provisions, the
      markets were filled with the flesh of dogs, and of unclean
      animals, who had died of disease. To obtain the valuable
      acquisition of a pound of bread, the Goths resigned the
      possession of an expensive, though serviceable, slave; and a
      small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of
      a precious, but useless metal, 69 when their property was
      exhausted, they continued this necessary traffic by the sale of
      their sons and daughters; and notwithstanding the love of
      freedom, which animated every Gothic breast, they submitted to
      the humiliating maxim, that it was better for their children to
      be maintained in a servile condition, than to perish in a state
      of wretched and helpless independence. The most lively resentment
      is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who sternly
      exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by
      subsequent injuries: a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in
      the camp of the Barbarians, who pleaded, without success, the
      merit of their patient and dutiful behavior; and loudly
      complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received
      from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and
      plenty of a fertile province, in the midst of which they suffered
      the intolerable hardships of artificial famine. But the means of
      relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands; since the
      rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the
      possession and the use of arms. The clamors of a multitude,
      untaught to disguise their sentiments, announced the first
      symptoms of resistance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of
      Lupicinus and Maximus. Those crafty ministers, who substituted
      the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary
      counsels of general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from
      their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire; and to
      disperse them, in separate quarters of cantonment, through the
      interior provinces. As they were conscious how ill they had
      deserved the respect, or confidence, of the Barbarians, they
      diligently collected, from every side, a military force, that
      might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who had not
      yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman subjects. But
      the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely directed
      to the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and
      the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube.
      The fatal oversight was observed, and improved, by Alatheus and
      Saphrax, who anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping
      from the pursuit of the Huns. By the help of such rafts and
      vessels as could be hastily procured, the leaders of the
      Ostrogoths transported, without opposition, their king and their
      army; and boldly fixed a hostile and independent camp on the
      territories of the empire. 70

      Under the name of Judges, Alavivus and Fritigern were the leaders
      of the Visigoths in peace and war; and the authority which they
      derived from their birth was ratified by the free consent of the
      nation. In a season of tranquility, their power might have been
      equal, as well as their rank; but, as soon as their countrymen
      were exasperated by hunger and oppression, the superior abilities
      of Fritigern assumed the military command, which he was qualified
      to exercise for the public welfare. He restrained the impatient
      spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and the insults of
      their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of
      mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid
      advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation.
      Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the
      Gothic powers under the same standard, he secretly cultivated the
      friendship of the Ostrogoths; and while he professed an implicit
      obedience to the orders of the Roman generals, he proceeded by
      slow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower
      Mæsia, about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube. On that
      fatal spot, the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth
      into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic
      chiefs to a splendid entertainment; and their martial train
      remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates
      of the city were strictly guarded, and the Barbarians were
      sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which
      they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their
      humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision; and as
      their patience was now exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and
      the Goths, were soon involved in a conflict of passionate
      altercation and angry reproaches. A blow was imprudently given; a
      sword was hastily drawn; and the first blood that was spilt in
      this accidental quarrel, became the signal of a long and
      destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance,
      Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his
      soldiers were slain, and despoiled of their arms; and as he was
      already inflamed by wine, and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash
      command, that their death should be revenged by the massacre of
      the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus.

      The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his
      extreme danger; and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit
      of a hero, he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of
      deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him. “A
      trifling dispute,” said the Gothic leader, with a firm but gentle
      tone of voice, “appears to have arisen between the two nations;
      but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences,
      unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our
      safety, and the authority of our presence.” At these words,
      Fritigern and his companions drew their swords, opened their
      passage through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace,
      the streets, and the gates, of Marcianopolis, and, mounting their
      horses, hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans.
      The generals of the Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful
      acclamations of the camp; war was instantly resolved, and the
      resolution was executed without delay: the banners of the nation
      were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors; and
      the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the
      Barbarian trumpet. 71 The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had
      dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still
      presumed to despise, his formidable enemy, marched against the
      Goths, at the head of such a military force as could be collected
      on this sudden emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach
      about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the
      talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing
      efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops. The valor
      of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern,
      that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the ranks of the
      Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards, his
      tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and
      their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious
      flight of their leader. “That successful day put an end to the
      distress of the Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from
      that day, the Goths, renouncing the precarious condition of
      strangers and exiles, assumed the character of citizens and
      masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the possessors of
      land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces of the
      empire, which are bounded by the Danube.” Such are the words of
      the Gothic historian, 72 who celebrates, with rude eloquence, the
      glory of his countrymen. But the dominion of the Barbarians was
      exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction. As
      they had been deprived, by the ministers of the emperor, of the
      common benefits of nature, and the fair intercourse of social
      life, they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the
      empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus were expiated by the ruin of
      the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the conflagration of their
      villages, and the massacre, or captivity, of their innocent
      families. The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over
      the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the Romans
      with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed to
      increase the forces of Fritigern, and the calamities of the
      province. Some time before the great emigration, a numerous body
      of Goths, under the command of Suerid and Colias, had been
      received into the protection and service of the empire. 73 They
      were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople; but the ministers
      of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont, at a
      distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be
      communicated by the neighborhood, and the success, of their
      countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded to
      the order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their
      fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of
      provisions, and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the
      most dutiful terms. But the first magistrate of Hadrianople,
      incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his
      country-house, refused this indulgence; and arming against them
      the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city, he urged,
      with hostile threats, their instant departure. The Barbarians
      stood silent and amazed, till they were exasperated by the
      insulting clamors, and missile weapons, of the populace: but when
      patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the undisciplined
      multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their
      flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armor, 74
      which they were unworthy to bear. The resemblance of their
      sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious
      detachment to the nation of the Visigoths; the troops of Colias
      and Suerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern, ranged
      themselves under his standard, and signalized their ardor in the
      siege of Hadrianople. But the resistance of the garrison informed
      the Barbarians, that in the attack of regular fortifications, the
      efforts of unskillful courage are seldom effectual. Their general
      acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that “he was
      at peace with stone walls,” 75 and revenged his disappointment on
      the adjacent country. He accepted, with pleasure, the useful
      reenforcement of hardy workmen, who labored in the gold mines of
      Thrace, 76 for the emolument, and under the lash, of an unfeeling
      master: 77 and these new associates conducted the Barbarians,
      through the secret paths, to the most sequestered places, which
      had been chosen to secure the inhabitants, the cattle, and the
      magazines of corn. With the assistance of such guides, nothing
      could remain impervious or inaccessible; resistance was fatal;
      flight was impracticable; and the patient submission of helpless
      innocence seldom found mercy from the Barbarian conqueror. In the
      course of these depredations, a great number of the children of
      the Goths, who had been sold into captivity, were restored to the
      embraces of their afflicted parents; but these tender interviews,
      which might have revived and cherished in their minds some
      sentiments of humanity, tended only to stimulate their native
      fierceness by the desire of revenge. They listened, with eager
      attention, to the complaints of their captive children, who had
      suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry
      passions of their masters, and the same cruelties, the same
      indignities, were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters
      of the Romans. 78

      The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into
      the heart of the empire a nation of enemies; but the Visigoths
      might even yet have been reconciled, by the manly confession of
      past errors, and the sincere performance of former engagements.
      These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the
      timorous disposition of the sovereign of the East: but, on this
      occasion alone, Valens was brave; and his unseasonable bravery
      was fatal to himself and to his subjects. He declared his
      intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople, to subdue
      this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not ignorant of the
      difficulties of the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of
      his nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of
      the West. The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the
      defence of Armenia; that important frontier was abandoned to the
      discretion of Sapor; and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war
      was intrusted, during the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants
      Trajan and Profuturus, two generals who indulged themselves in a
      very false and favorable opinion of their own abilities. On their
      arrival in Thrace, they were joined by Richomer, count of the
      domestics; and the auxiliaries of the West, that marched under
      his banner, were composed of the Gallic legions, reduced indeed,
      by a spirit of desertion, to the vain appearances of strength and
      numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride,
      rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and to encounter,
      the Barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile
      meadows, near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube.
      79 Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of
      wagons; 80 and the Barbarians, secure within the vast circle of
      the enclosure, enjoyed the fruits of their valor, and the spoils
      of the province. In the midst of riotous intemperance, the
      watchful Fritigern observed the motions, and penetrated the
      designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers of the
      enemy were continually increasing: and, as he understood their
      intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of
      forage should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their
      standard his predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent
      country. As soon as they descried the flaming beacons, 81 they
      obeyed, with incredible speed, the signal of their leader: the
      camp was filled with the martial crowd of Barbarians; their
      impatient clamors demanded the battle, and their tumultuous zeal
      was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs. The
      evening was already far advanced; and the two armies prepared
      themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only
      till the dawn of day.

      While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the
      Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath;
      and as they advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which
      celebrated the glory of their forefathers, were mingled with
      their fierce and dissonant outcries, and opposed to the
      artificial harmony of the Roman shout. Some military skill was
      displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding
      eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the
      light, was maintained on either side, by the personal and
      obstinate efforts of strength, valor, and agility. The legions of
      Armenia supported their fame in arms; but they were oppressed by
      the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of
      the Romans was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed
      with their mangled carcasses. This partial defeat was balanced,
      however, by partial success; and when the two armies, at a late
      hour of the evening, retreated to their respective camps, neither
      of them could claim the honors, or the effects, of a decisive
      victory. The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans, in
      proportion to the smallness of their numbers; but the Goths were
      so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous, and perhaps
      unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven days within the
      circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as the
      circumstances of time and place would admit, were piously
      discharged to some officers of distinguished rank; but the
      indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain. Their flesh
      was greedily devoured by the birds of prey, who in that age
      enjoyed very frequent and delicious feasts; and several years
      afterwards the white and naked bones, which covered the wide
      extent of the fields, presented to the eyes of Ammianus a
      dreadful monument of the battle of Salices. 82

      The progress of the Goths had been checked by the doubtful event
      of that bloody day; and the Imperial generals, whose army would
      have been consumed by the repetition of such a contest, embraced
      the more rational plan of destroying the Barbarians by the wants
      and pressure of their own multitudes. They prepared to confine
      the Visigoths in the narrow angle of land between the Danube, the
      desert of Scythia, and the mountains of Hæmus, till their
      strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevitable
      operation of famine. The design was prosecuted with some conduct
      and success: the Barbarians had almost exhausted their own
      magazines, and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of
      Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to
      improve the strength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman
      fortifications. His labors were interrupted by the alarming
      intelligence, that new swarms of Barbarians had passed the
      unguarded Danube, either to support the cause, or to imitate the
      example, of Fritigern. The just apprehension, that he himself
      might be surrounded, and overwhelmed, by the arms of hostile and
      unknown nations, compelled Saturninus to relinquish the siege of
      the Gothic camp; and the indignant Visigoths, breaking from their
      confinement, satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated
      devastation of the fruitful country, which extends above three
      hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the straits of the
      Hellespont. 83 The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed
      to the passions, as well as to the interest, of his Barbarian
      allies; and the love of rapine, and the hatred of Rome, seconded,
      or even prevented, the eloquence of his ambassadors. He cemented
      a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his
      countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of
      their infant king: the long animosity of rival tribes was
      suspended by the sense of their common interest; the independent
      part of the nation was associated under one standard; and the
      chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior
      genius of the general of the Visigoths. He obtained the
      formidable aid of the Taifalæ, 8311 whose military renown was
      disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic
      manners. Every youth, on his entrance into the world, was united
      by the ties of honorable friendship, and brutal love, to some
      warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to be released from this
      unnatural connection, till he had approved his manhood by
      slaying, in single combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the
      forest. 84 But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were
      drawn from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from
      their native seats. The loose subordination, and extensive
      possessions, of the Huns and the Alani, delayed the conquests,
      and distracted the councils, of that victorious people. Several
      of the hords were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern;
      and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and energy to the
      steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry. The
      Sarmatians, who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian,
      enjoyed and increased the general confusion; and a seasonable
      irruption of the Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul, engaged
      the attention, and diverted the forces, of the emperor of the
      West. 85

      Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.—Part IV.


      One of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of
      the Barbarians into the army and the palace, was sensibly felt in
      their correspondence with their hostile countrymen; to whom they
      imprudently, or maliciously, revealed the weakness of the Roman
      empire. A soldier, of the lifeguards of Gratian, was of the
      nation of the Alemanni, and of the tribe of the Lentienses, who
      dwelt beyond the Lake of Constance. Some domestic business
      obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a short visit to
      his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious
      inquiries: and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him
      to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the
      state, and the designs of his master. The intelligence, that
      Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul, and of
      the West, to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointed out to
      the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment, and the mode, of
      a successful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments,
      who, in the month of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice, was
      the prelude of a more important war. The boldest hopes of rapine,
      perhaps of conquest, outweighed the considerations of timid
      prudence, or national faith. Every forest, and every village,
      poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of
      the Alemanni, which, on their approach, was estimated at forty
      thousand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified
      to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous
      flattery of the Imperial court. The legions, which had been
      ordered to march into Pannonia, were immediately recalled, or
      detained, for the defence of Gaul; the military command was
      divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the youthful
      emperor, though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom
      of the former, was much more inclined to admire, and to follow,
      the martial ardor of his colleague; who was allowed to unite the
      incompatible characters of count of the domestics, and of king of
      the Franks. His rival Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided,
      or rather impelled, by the same headstrong valor; and as their
      troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders, they met,
      they saw, they encountered each other, near the town of
      Argentaria, or Colmar, 86 in the plains of Alsace. The glory of
      the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons, and
      well-practised evolutions, of the Roman soldiers; the Alemanni,
      who long maintained their ground, were slaughtered with
      unrelenting fury; five thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to
      the woods and mountains; and the glorious death of their king on
      the field of battle saved him from the reproaches of the people,
      who are always disposed to accuse the justice, or policy, of an
      unsuccessful war. After this signal victory, which secured the
      peace of Gaul, and asserted the honor of the Roman arms, the
      emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern
      expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni, he
      suddenly inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected
      passage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their
      country. The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of
      nature and of courage; and still continued to retreat, from one
      hill to another, till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of
      the power and perseverance of their enemies. Their submission was
      accepted as a proof, not indeed of their sincere repentance, but
      of their actual distress; and a select number of their brave and
      robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation, as the most
      substantial pledge of their future moderation. The subjects of
      the empire, who had so often experienced that the Alemanni could
      neither be subdued by arms, nor restrained by treaties, might not
      promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity: but they
      discovered, in the virtues of their young sovereign, the prospect
      of a long and auspicious reign. When the legions climbed the
      mountains, and scaled the fortifications of the Barbarians, the
      valor of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks; and the
      gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered
      by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment
      to the person of their sovereign. At the age of nineteen, the son
      of Valentinian seemed to possess the talents of peace and war;
      and his personal success against the Alemanni was interpreted as
      a sure presage of his Gothic triumphs. 87

      While Gratian deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects,
      the emperor Valens, who, at length, had removed his court and
      army from Antioch, was received by the people of Constantinople
      as the author of the public calamity. Before he had reposed
      himself ten days in the capital, he was urged by the licentious
      clamors of the Hippodrome to march against the Barbarians, whom
      he had invited into his dominions; and the citizens, who are
      always brave at a distance from any real danger, declared, with
      confidence, that, if they were supplied with arms, _they_ alone
      would undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an
      insulting foe. 88 The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude
      hastened the downfall of the Roman empire; they provoked the
      desperate rashness of Valens; who did not find, either in his
      reputation or in his mind, any motives to support with firmness
      the public contempt. He was soon persuaded, by the successful
      achievements of his lieutenants, to despise the power of the
      Goths, who, by the diligence of Fritigern, were now collected in
      the neighborhood of Hadrianople. The march of the Taifalæ had
      been intercepted by the valiant Frigeric: the king of those
      licentious Barbarians was slain in battle; and the suppliant
      captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of
      Italy, which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant
      territories of Modena and Parma. 89 The exploits of Sebastian, 90
      who was recently engaged in the service of Valens, and promoted
      to the rank of master-general of the infantry, were still more
      honorable to himself, and useful to the republic. He obtained the
      permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the
      legions; and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of
      discipline, and the exercise of arms, which were almost forgotten
      under the reign of Valens. By the vigor and conduct of Sebastian,
      a large body of the Goths were surprised in their camp; and the
      immense spoil, which was recovered from their hands, filled the
      city of Hadrianople, and the adjacent plain. The splendid
      narratives, which the general transmitted of his own exploits,
      alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit;
      and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the
      Gothic war, his valor was praised, his advice was rejected; and
      Valens, who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering
      suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to seize
      the glory of an easy and assured conquest. His army was
      strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of veterans; and his
      march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so
      much military skill, that he prevented the activity of the
      Barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and
      to intercept either the troops themselves, or their convoys of
      provisions. The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls
      of Hadrianople, was fortified, according to the practice of the
      Romans, with a ditch and rampart; and a most important council
      was summoned, to decide the fate of the emperor and of the
      empire. The party of reason and of delay was strenuously
      maintained by Victor, who had corrected, by the lessons of
      experience, the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character;
      while Sebastian, with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a
      courtier, represented every precaution, and every measure, that
      implied a doubt of immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage
      and majesty of their invincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was
      precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern, and the prudent
      admonitions of the emperor of the West. The advantages of
      negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the
      general of the Barbarians; and a Christian ecclesiastic was
      despatched, as the holy minister of peace, to penetrate, and to
      perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes, as well as
      the provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and truly
      described by their ambassador; who protested, in the name of
      Fritigern, that he was still disposed to lay down his arms, or to
      employ them only in the defence of the empire; if he could secure
      for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste
      lands of Thrace, and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle.
      But he added, in a whisper of confidential friendship, that the
      exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable
      conditions; and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could
      accomplish the conclusion of the treaty, unless he found himself
      supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army. About
      the same time, Count Richomer returned from the West to announce
      the defeat and submission of the Alemanni, to inform Valens that
      his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran
      and victorious legions of Gaul, and to request, in the name of
      Gratian and of the republic, that every dangerous and decisive
      measure might be suspended, till the junction of the two emperors
      should insure the success of the Gothic war. But the feeble
      sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of
      pride and jealousy. He disdained the importunate advice; he
      rejected the humiliating aid; he secretly compared the
      ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his own reign,
      with the fame of a beardless youth; and Valens rushed into the
      field, to erect his imaginary trophy, before the diligence of his
      colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.

      On the ninth of August, a day which has deserved to be marked
      among the most inauspicious of the Roman Calendar, 91 the emperor
      Valens, leaving, under a strong guard, his baggage and military
      treasure, marched from Hadrianople to attack the Goths, who were
      encamped about twelve miles from the city. 92 By some mistake of
      the orders, or some ignorance of the ground, the right wing, or
      column of cavalry arrived in sight of the enemy, whilst the left
      was still at a considerable distance; the soldiers were
      compelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to precipitate their
      pace; and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion
      and irregular delay. The Gothic cavalry had been detached to
      forage in the adjacent country; and Fritigern still continued to
      practise his customary arts. He despatched messengers of peace,
      made proposals, required hostages, and wasted the hours, till the
      Romans, exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun,
      were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and intolerable fatigue. The
      emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the Gothic camp;
      the zeal of Richomer, who alone had courage to accept the
      dangerous commission, was applauded; and the count of the
      domestics, adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity, had
      proceeded some way in the space between the two armies, when he
      was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle. The hasty and
      imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian, who commanded
      a body of archers and targeteers; and as they advanced with
      rashness, they retreated with loss and disgrace. In the same
      moment, the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose
      return was anxiously expected by the general of the Goths,
      descended like a whirlwind from the hills, swept across the
      plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous, but irresistible
      charge of the Barbarian host. The event of the battle of
      Hadrianople, so fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be
      described in a few words: the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry
      was abandoned, surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful
      evolutions, the firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to
      extricate a body of foot, encompassed, on an open plain, by
      superior numbers of horse; but the troops of Valens, oppressed by
      the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a
      narrow space, where it was impossible for them to extend their
      ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords and javelins. In
      the midst of tumult, of slaughter, and of dismay, the emperor,
      deserted by his guards and wounded, as it was supposed, with an
      arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii,
      who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order
      and firmness. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who
      perceived his danger, loudly exclaimed that all was lost, unless
      the person of the emperor could be saved. Some troops, animated
      by their exhortation, advanced to his relief: they found only a
      bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled
      bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince,
      either among the living or the dead. Their search could not
      indeed be successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances
      with which some historians have related the death of the emperor.

      By the care of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field
      of battle to a neighboring cottage, where they attempted to dress
      his wound, and to provide for his future safety. But this humble
      retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy: they tried to
      force the door, they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from
      the roof, till at length, impatient of delay, they set fire to a
      pile of dry magots, and consumed the cottage with the Roman
      emperor and his train. Valens perished in the flames; and a
      youth, who dropped from the window, alone escaped, to attest the
      melancholy tale, and to inform the Goths of the inestimable prize
      which they had lost by their own rashness. A great number of
      brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of
      Hadrianople, which equalled in the actual loss, and far surpassed
      in the fatal consequences, the misfortune which Rome had formerly
      sustained in the fields of Cannæ. 93 Two master-generals of the
      cavalry and infantry, two great officers of the palace, and
      thirty-five tribunes, were found among the slain; and the death
      of Sebastian might satisfy the world, that he was the victim, as
      well as the author, of the public calamity. Above two thirds of
      the Roman army were destroyed: and the darkness of the night was
      esteemed a very favorable circumstance, as it served to conceal
      the flight of the multitude, and to protect the more orderly
      retreat of Victor and Richomer, who alone, amidst the general
      consternation, maintained the advantage of calm courage and
      regular discipline. 94

      While the impressions of grief and terror were still recent in
      the minds of men, the most celebrated rhetorician of the age
      composed the funeral oration of a vanquished army, and of an
      unpopular prince, whose throne was already occupied by a
      stranger. “There are not wanting,” says the candid Libanius,
      “those who arraign the prudence of the emperor, or who impute the
      public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in the
      troops. For my own part, I reverence the memory of their former
      exploits: I reverence the glorious death, which they bravely
      received, standing, and fighting in their ranks: I reverence the
      field of battle, stained with _their_ blood, and the blood of the
      Barbarians. Those honorable marks have been already washed away
      by the rains; but the lofty monuments of their bones, the bones
      of generals, of centurions, and of valiant warriors, claim a
      longer period of duration. The king himself fought and fell in
      the foremost ranks of the battle. His attendants presented him
      with the fleetest horses of the Imperial stable, that would soon
      have carried him beyond the pursuit of the enemy. They vainly
      pressed him to reserve his important life for the future service
      of the republic. He still declared that he was unworthy to
      survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects;
      and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain.
      Let none, therefore, presume to ascribe the victory of the
      Barbarians to the fear, the weakness, or the imprudence, of the
      Roman troops. The chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the
      virtue of their ancestors, whom they equalled in discipline and
      the arts of war. Their generous emulation was supported by the
      love of glory, which prompted them to contend at the same time
      with heat and thirst, with fire and the sword; and cheerfully to
      embrace an honorable death, as their refuge against flight and
      infamy. The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of
      the success of our enemies.” The truth of history may disclaim
      some parts of this panegyric, which cannot strictly be reconciled
      with the character of Valens, or the circumstances of the battle:
      but the fairest commendation is due to the eloquence, and still
      more to the generosity, of the sophist of Antioch. 95

      The pride of the Goths was elated by this memorable victory; but
      their avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery, that
      the richest part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls
      of Hadrianople. They hastened to possess the reward of their
      valor; but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquished
      army, with an intrepid resolution, which was the effect of their
      despair, and the only hope of their safety. The walls of the
      city, and the ramparts of the adjacent camp, were lined with
      military engines, that threw stones of an enormous weight; and
      astonished the ignorant Barbarians by the noise, and velocity,
      still more than by the real effects, of the discharge. The
      soldiers, the citizens, the provincials, the domestics of the
      palace, were united in the danger, and in the defence: the
      furious assault of the Goths was repulsed; their secret arts of
      treachery and treason were discovered; and, after an obstinate
      conflict of many hours, they retired to their tents; convinced,
      by experience, that it would be far more advisable to observe the
      treaty, which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with
      the fortifications of great and populous cities. After the hasty
      and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters, an act of
      justice extremely useful to the discipline of the Roman armies,
      the Goths indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople. The scene
      of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude:
      the multitude suddenly disappeared; the secret paths of the woods
      and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling
      fugitives, who sought a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum
      and Macedonia; and the faithful officers of the household, and
      the treasury, cautiously proceeded in search of the emperor, of
      whose death they were still ignorant. The tide of the Gothic
      inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the suburbs of
      Constantinople. The Barbarians were surprised with the splendid
      appearance of the capital of the East, the height and extent of
      the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who
      crowded the ramparts, and the various prospect of the sea and
      land. While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible
      beauties of Constantinople, a sally was made from one of the
      gates by a party of Saracens, 96 who had been fortunately engaged
      in the service of Valens. The cavalry of Scythia was forced to
      yield to the admirable swiftness and spirit of the Arabian
      horses: their riders were skilled in the evolutions of irregular
      war; and the Northern Barbarians were astonished and dismayed, by
      the inhuman ferocity of the Barbarians of the South.

      A Gothic soldier was slain by the dagger of an Arab; and the
      hairy, naked savage, applying his lips to the wound, expressed a
      horrid delight, while he sucked the blood of his vanquished
      enemy. 97 The army of the Goths, laden with the spoils of the
      wealthy suburbs and the adjacent territory, slowly moved, from
      the Bosphorus, to the mountains which form the western boundary
      of Thrace. The important pass of Succi was betrayed by the fear,
      or the misconduct, of Maurus; and the Barbarians, who no longer
      had any resistance to apprehend from the scattered and vanquished
      troops of the East, spread themselves over the face of a fertile
      and cultivated country, as far as the confines of Italy and the
      Hadriatic Sea. 98

      The Romans, who so coolly, and so concisely, mention the acts of
      _justice_ which were exercised by the legions, 99 reserve their
      compassion, and their eloquence, for their own sufferings, when
      the provinces were invaded, and desolated, by the arms of the
      successful Barbarians. The simple circumstantial narrative (did
      such a narrative exist) of the ruin of a single town, of the
      misfortunes of a single family, 100 might exhibit an interesting
      and instructive picture of human manners: but the tedious
      repetition of vague and declamatory complaints would fatigue the
      attention of the most patient reader. The same censure may be
      applied, though not perhaps in an equal degree, to the profane,
      and the ecclesiastical, writers of this unhappy period; that
      their minds were inflamed by popular and religious animosity; and
      that the true size and color of every object is falsified by the
      exaggerations of their corrupt eloquence. The vehement Jerom 101
      might justly deplore the calamities inflicted by the Goths, and
      their barbarous allies, on his native country of Pannonia, and
      the wide extent of the provinces, from the walls of
      Constantinople to the foot of the Julian Alps; the rapes, the
      massacres, the conflagrations; and, above all, the profanation of
      the churches, that were turned into stables, and the contemptuous
      treatment of the relics of holy martyrs. But the Saint is surely
      transported beyond the limits of nature and history, when he
      affirms, “that, in those desert countries, nothing was left
      except the sky and the earth; that, after the destruction of the
      cities, and the extirpation of the human race, the land was
      overgrown with thick forests and inextricable brambles; and that
      the universal desolation, announced by the prophet Zephaniah, was
      accomplished, in the scarcity of the beasts, the birds, and even
      of the fish.” These complaints were pronounced about twenty years
      after the death of Valens; and the Illyrian provinces, which were
      constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the Barbarians,
      still continued, after a calamitous period of ten centuries, to
      supply new materials for rapine and destruction. Could it even be
      supposed, that a large tract of country had been left without
      cultivation and without inhabitants, the consequences might not
      have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated
      nature. The useful and feeble animals, which are nourished by the
      hand of man, might suffer and perish, if they were deprived of
      his protection; but the beasts of the forest, his enemies or his
      victims, would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of
      their solitary domain. The various tribes that people the air, or
      the waters, are still less connected with the fate of the human
      species; and it is highly probable that the fish of the Danube
      would have felt more terror and distress, from the approach of a
      voracious pike, than from the hostile inroad of a Gothic army.

      Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.—Part V.


      Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of
      Europe, there was reason to fear that the same calamities would
      soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia. The sons of the
      Goths had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the
      East; and the arts of education were employed to polish, and
      subdue, the native fierceness of their temper. In the space of
      about twelve years, their numbers had continually increased; and
      the children, who, in the first emigration, were sent over the
      Hellespont, had attained, with rapid growth, the strength and
      spirit of perfect manhood. 102 It was impossible to conceal from
      their knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as those
      daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation, they
      betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intention, to
      emulate the glorious example of their fathers. The danger of the
      times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the
      provincials; and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable
      evidence, that the Goths of Asia had formed a secret and
      dangerous conspiracy against the public safety. The death of
      Valens had left the East without a sovereign; and Julius, who
      filled the important station of master-general of the troops,
      with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his
      duty to consult the senate of Constantinople; which he
      considered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the
      representative council of the nation. As soon as he had obtained
      the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most
      expedient for the good of the republic, he assembled the
      principal officers, and privately concerted effectual measures
      for the execution of his bloody design. An order was immediately
      promulgated, that, on a stated day, the Gothic youth should
      assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces;
      and, as a report was industriously circulated, that they were
      summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money, the
      pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and, perhaps,
      suspended the motions of the conspiracy. On the appointed day,
      the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in
      the square or Forum; the streets and avenues were occupied by the
      Roman troops, and the roofs of the houses were covered with
      archers and slingers. At the same hour, in all the cities of the
      East, the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the
      provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius,
      from a domestic enemy, who, in a few months, might have carried
      fire and sword from the Hellespont to the Euphrates. 103 The
      urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly
      authorize the violation of every positive law. How far that, or
      any other, consideration may operate to dissolve the natural
      obligations of humanity and justice, is a doctrine of which I
      still desire to remain ignorant.

      throne of the East.]

      The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the
      plains of Hadrianople, when he was informed, at first by the
      confused voice of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate
      reports of Victor and Richomer, that his impatient colleague had
      been slain in battle, and that two thirds of the Roman army were
      exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths. Whatever
      resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might
      deserve, the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by
      the softer emotions of grief and compassion; and even the sense
      of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration
      of the state of the republic. Gratian was too late to assist, he
      was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the
      valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a
      sinking world. A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of Germany
      seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of
      Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the
      Western empire. In this important crisis, the government of the
      East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided
      attention of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested with such
      ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a
      distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wise
      and manly resolution of conferring an obligation, rather than of
      yielding to an insult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the
      purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it
      is not easy for a prince, educated in the supreme rank, to
      understand the true characters of his ministers and generals. He
      attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits
      and defects; and, whilst he checked the rash confidence of
      ambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of
      the republic. As each moment of delay diminished something of the
      power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the
      situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The
      choice of Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile, whose
      father, only three years before, had suffered, under the sanction
      of _his_ authority, an unjust and ignominious death. The great
      Theodosius, a name celebrated in history, and dear to the
      Catholic church, 104 was summoned to the Imperial court, which
      had gradually retreated from the confines of Thrace to the more
      secure station of Sirmium. Five months after the death of Valens,
      the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled troops _his_
      colleague and _their_ master; who, after a modest, perhaps a
      sincere, resistance, was compelled to accept, amidst the general
      acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of
      Augustus. 105 The provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Egypt, over
      which Valens had reigned, were resigned to the administration of
      the new emperor; but, as he was specially intrusted with the
      conduct of the Gothic war, the Illyrian præfecture was
      dismembered; and the two great dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia
      were added to the dominions of the Eastern empire. 106

      The same province, and perhaps the same city, 107 which had given
      to the throne the virtues of Trajan, and the talents of Hadrian,
      was the orignal seat of another family of Spaniards, who, in a
      less fortunate age, possessed, near fourscore years, the
      declining empire of Rome. 108 They emerged from the obscurity of
      municipal honors by the active spirit of the elder Theodosius, a
      general whose exploits in Britain and Africa have formed one of
      the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian. The son of
      that general, who likewise bore the name of Theodosius, was
      educated, by skilful preceptors, in the liberal studies of youth;
      but he was instructed in the art of war by the tender care and
      severe discipline of his father. 109 Under the standard of such a
      leader, young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge, in the most
      distant scenes of military action; inured his constitution to the
      difference of seasons and climates; distinguished his valor by
      sea and land; and observed the various warfare of the Scots, the
      Saxons, and the Moors. His own merit, and the recommendation of
      the conqueror of Africa, soon raised him to a separate command;
      and, in the station of Duke of Mæsia, he vanquished an army of
      Sarmatians; saved the province; deserved the love of the
      soldiers; and provoked the envy of the court. 110 His rising
      fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his
      illustrious father; and Theodosius obtained, as a favor, the
      permission of retiring to a private life in his native province
      of Spain. He displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease
      with which he adapted himself to this new situation. His time was
      almost equally divided between the town and country; the spirit,
      which had animated his public conduct, was shown in the active
      and affectionate performance of every social duty; and the
      diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the
      improvement of his ample patrimony, 111 which lay between
      Valladolid and Segovia, in the midst of a fruitful district,
      still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep. 112 From the
      innocent, but humble labors of his farm, Theodosius was
      transported, in less than four months, to the throne of the
      Eastern empire; and the whole period of the history of the world
      will not perhaps afford a similar example, of an elevation at the
      same time so pure and so honorable. The princes who peaceably
      inherit the sceptre of their fathers, claim and enjoy a legal
      right, the more secure as it is absolutely distinct from the
      merits of their personal characters. The subjects, who, in a
      monarchy, or a popular state, acquire the possession of supreme
      power, may have raised themselves, by the superiority either of
      genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals; but their
      virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the
      successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of
      conspiracy, or civil war. Even in those governments which allow
      the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor, his
      partial choice, which may be influenced by the blindest passions,
      is often directed to an unworthy object But the most suspicious
      malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius, in his obscure solitude
      of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the hopes, of an
      ambitious statesman; and the name of the Exile would long since
      have been forgotten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had
      not left a deep impression in the Imperial court. During the
      season of prosperity, he had been neglected; but, in the public
      distress, his superior merit was universally felt and
      acknowledged. What confidence must have been reposed in his
      integrity, since Gratian could trust, that a pious son would
      forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of his father!
      What expectations must have been formed of his abilities to
      encourage the hope, that a single man could save, and restore,
      the empire of the East! Theodosius was invested with the purple
      in the thirty-third year of his age. The vulgar gazed with
      admiration on the manly beauty of his face, and the graceful
      majesty of his person, which they were pleased to compare with
      the pictures and medals of the emperor Trajan; whilst intelligent
      observers discovered, in the qualities of his heart and
      understanding, a more important resemblance to the best and
      greatest of the Roman princes.

      It is not without the most sincere regret, that I must now take
      leave of an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the
      history of his own times, without indulging the prejudices and
      passions, which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.
      Ammianus Marcellinus, who terminates his useful work with the
      defeat and death of Valens, recommends the more glorious subject
      of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and eloquence of the
      rising generation. 113 The rising generation was not disposed to
      accept his advice or to imitate his example; 114 and, in the
      study of the reign of Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate
      the partial narrative of Zosimus, by the obscure hints of
      fragments and chronicles, by the figurative style of poetry or
      panegyric, and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical
      writers, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to
      despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation.
      Conscious of these disadvantages, which will continue to involve
      a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman
      empire, I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps. Yet I
      may boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never
      revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the
      Barbarians: and the expressive silence of his venal orators may
      be confirmed by the observation of the condition and
      circumstances of the times. The fabric of a mighty state, which
      has been reared by the labors of successive ages, could not be
      overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power
      of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the
      calamity. The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the
      plains of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the
      populous provinces of the East, which contained so many millions
      of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier is found to be the
      cheapest, and most common, quality of human nature; and
      sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have
      been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions. If
      the Barbarians were mounted on the horses, and equipped with the
      armor, of their vanquished enemies, the numerous studs of
      Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of
      cavalry; the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully
      stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms: and the
      wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the
      expenses of the war. But the effects which were produced by the
      battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the
      Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the
      latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A Gothic chief was
      heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for his own
      part, he was fatigued with slaughter: but that he was astonished
      how a people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could
      still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and
      provinces. 115 The same terrors which the name of the Huns had
      spread among the Gothic tribes, were inspired, by the formidable
      name of the Goths, among the subjects and soldiers of the Roman
      empire. 116 If Theodosius, hastily collecting his scattered
      forces, had led them into the field to encounter a victorious
      enemy, his army would have been vanquished by their own fears;
      and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of
      success. But the _great_ Theodosius, an epithet which he
      honorably deserved on this momentous occasion, conducted himself
      as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his
      head-quarters at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian
      diocese; 117 from whence he could watch the irregular motions of
      the Barbarians, and direct the operations of his lieutenants,
      from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic.
      The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened;
      and the troops, among whom a sense of order and discipline was
      revived, were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their
      own safety. From these secure stations, they were encouraged to
      make frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested the
      adjacent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage,
      without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of
      numbers, their enterprises were, for the most part, successful;
      and they were soon convinced, by their own experience, of the
      possibility of vanquishing their _invincible_ enemies. The
      detachments of these separate garrisons were generally united
      into small armies; the same cautious measures were pursued,
      according to an extensive and well-concerted plan of operations;
      the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman
      arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the
      most favorable reports of the success of the war, contributed to
      subdue the pride of the Barbarians, and to animate the hopes and
      courage of his subjects. If, instead of this faint and imperfect
      outline, we could accurately represent the counsels and actions
      of Theodosius, in four successive campaigns, there is reason to
      believe, that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of
      every military reader. The republic had formerly been saved by
      the delays of Fabius; and, while the splendid trophies of Scipio,
      in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity, the camps
      and marches of the dictator among the hills of the Campania, may
      claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame,
      which the general is not compelled to share, either with fortune
      or with his troops. Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius;
      and the infirmities of his body, which most unseasonably
      languished under a long and dangerous disease, could not oppress
      the vigor of his mind, or divert his attention from the public
      service. 118

      repose, of Theodosius, at Thessalonica: Zosimus, to diminish his

      The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces 119 was the work
      of prudence, rather than of valor: the prudence of Theodosius was
      seconded by fortune: and the emperor never failed to seize, and
      to improve, every favorable circumstance. As long as the superior
      genius of Fritigern preserved the union, and directed the motions
      of the Barbarians, their power was not inadequate to the conquest
      of a great empire. The death of that hero, the predecessor and
      master of the renowned Alaric, relieved an impatient multitude
      from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion. The
      Barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority, abandoned
      themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their passions
      were seldom uniform or consistent. An army of conquerors was
      broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their
      blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves,
      than to their enemies. Their mischievous disposition was shown in
      the destruction of every object which they wanted strength to
      remove, or taste to enjoy; and they often consumed, with
      improvident rage, the harvests, or the granaries, which soon
      afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence. A spirit
      of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations, which
      had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary
      alliance. The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally
      upbraid the flight of the Goths; who were not disposed to use
      with moderation the advantages of their fortune; the ancient
      jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be
      suspended; and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults
      and injuries, which they had reciprocally offered, or sustained,
      while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube.
      The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive
      sentiment of national animosity; and the officers of Theodosius
      were instructed to purchase, with liberal gifts and promises, the
      retreat or service of the discontented party. The acquisition of
      Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and
      faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter
      soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important
      command; surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed
      in wine and sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished
      Goths, returned with an immense spoil, and four thousand wagons,
      to the Imperial camp. 120 In the hands of a skilful politician,
      the most different means may be successfully applied to the same
      ends; and the peace of the empire, which had been forwarded by
      the divisions, was accomplished by the reunion, of the Gothic
      nation. Athanaric, who had been a patient spectator of these
      extraordinary events, was at length driven, by the chance of
      arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland. He no
      longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part
      of the subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniences
      of anarchy, were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a
      Gothic Judge, whose birth they respected, and whose abilities
      they had frequently experienced. But age had chilled the daring
      spirit of Athanaric; and, instead of leading his people to the
      field of battle and victory, he wisely listened to the fair
      proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty. Theodosius, who
      was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally,
      condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from
      Constantinople; and entertained him in the Imperial city, with
      the confidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch.
      “The Barbarian prince observed, with curious attention, the
      variety of objects which attracted his notice, and at last broke
      out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder. I now
      behold (said he) what I never could believe, the glories of this
      stupendous capital! And as he cast his eyes around, he viewed,
      and he admired, the commanding situation of the city, the
      strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices, the
      capacious harbor, crowded with innumerable vessels, the perpetual
      concourse of distant nations, and the arms and discipline of the
      troops. Indeed, (continued Athanaric,) the emperor of the Romans
      is a god upon earth; and the presumptuous man, who dares to lift
      his hand against him, is guilty of his own blood.” 121 The Gothic
      king did not long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception;
      and, as temperance was not the virtue of his nation, it may
      justly be suspected, that his mortal disease was contracted
      amidst the pleasures of the Imperial banquets. But the policy of
      Theodosius derived more solid benefit from the death, than he
      could have expected from the most faithful services, of his ally.
      The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in the
      capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his
      memory; and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy, and
      decent grief, of Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the
      Roman empire. 122 The submission of so great a body of the
      Visigoths was productive of the most salutary consequences; and
      the mixed influence of force, of reason, and of corruption,
      became every day more powerful, and more extensive. Each
      independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty, from
      the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose _him_,
      alone and unprotected, to the revenge, or justice, of the
      conqueror. The general, or rather the final, capitulation of the
      Goths, may be dated four years, one month, and twenty-five days,
      after the defeat and death of the emperor Valens. 123

      The provinces of the Danube had been already relieved from the
      oppressive weight of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, by the
      voluntary retreat of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose restless spirit
      had prompted them to seek new scenes of rapine and glory. Their
      destructive course was pointed towards the West; but we must be
      satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their
      various adventures. The Ostrogoths impelled several of the German
      tribes on the provinces of Gaul; concluded, and soon violated, a
      treaty with the emperor Gratian; advanced into the unknown
      countries of the North; and, after an interval of more than four
      years, returned, with accumulated force, to the banks of the
      Lower Danube. Their troops were recruited with the fiercest
      warriors of Germany and Scythia; and the soldiers, or at least
      the historians, of the empire, no longer recognized the name and
      countenances of their former enemies. 124 The general who
      commanded the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier,
      soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to
      the public service; and that the Barbarians, awed by the presence
      of his fleet and legions, would probably defer the passage of the
      river till the approaching winter. The dexterity of the spies,
      whom he sent into the Gothic camp, allured the Barbarians into a
      fatal snare. They were persuaded that, by a bold attempt, they
      might surprise, in the silence and darkness of the night, the
      sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was hastily
      embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes. 125 The bravest of
      the Ostrogoths led the van; the main body consisted of the
      remainder of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and
      children securely followed in the rear. One of the nights without
      a moon had been selected for the execution of their design; and
      they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube, in the
      firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an
      unguarded camp. But the progress of the Barbarians was suddenly
      stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of vessels,
      strongly connected with each other, and which formed an
      impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While
      they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their
      right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet
      of galleys, which were urged down the stream by the united
      impulse of oars and of the tide. The weight and velocity of those
      ships of war broke, and sunk, and dispersed, the rude and feeble
      canoes of the Barbarians; their valor was ineffectual; and
      Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostrogoths, perished with
      his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or in the
      waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet
      might regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of
      the multitude rendered them alike incapable, either of action or
      counsel; and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious
      enemy. On this occasion, as well as on many others, it is a
      difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the
      writers of the age of Theodosius. The partial and malignant
      historian, who misrepresents every action of his reign, affirms,
      that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the
      Barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his
      lieutenant Promotus. 126 The flattering poet, who celebrated, in
      the court of Honorius, the glory of the father and of the son,
      ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius; and
      almost insinuates, that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by
      the hand of the emperor. 127 The truth of history might perhaps
      be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory
      assertions.

      the victorious ages of Rome.]

      The original treaty which fixed the settlement of the Goths,
      ascertained their privileges, and stipulated their obligations,
      would illustrate the history of Theodosius and his successors.
      The series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit
      and substance of this single agreement. 128 The ravages of war
      and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but
      uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians who might not
      disdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of the
      Visigoths was seated in Thrace; the remains of the Ostrogoths
      were planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were
      supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle; and their future
      industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a
      certain term of years. The Barbarians would have deserved to feel
      the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court, if they
      had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces.
      They required, and they obtained, the sole possession of the
      villages and districts assigned for their residence; they still
      cherished and propagated their native manners and language;
      asserted, in the bosom of despotism, the freedom of their
      domestic government; and acknowledged the sovereignty of the
      emperor, without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the
      laws and magistrates of Rome. The hereditary chiefs of the tribes
      and families were still permitted to command their followers in
      peace and war; but the royal dignity was abolished; and the
      generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure
      of the emperor. An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained
      for the perpetual service of the empire of the East; and those
      haughty troops, who assumed the title of _Fæderati_, or allies,
      were distinguished by their gold collars, liberal pay, and
      licentious privileges. Their native courage was improved by the
      use of arms and the knowledge of discipline; and, while the
      republic was guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful sword of the
      Barbarians, the last sparks of the military flame were finally
      extinguished in the minds of the Romans. 129 Theodosius had the
      address to persuade his allies, that the conditions of peace,
      which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity, were
      the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the
      Gothic nation. 130 A different mode of vindication or apology was
      opposed to the complaints of the people; who loudly censured
      these shameful and dangerous concessions. 131 The calamities of
      the war were painted in the most lively colors; and the first
      symptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and security, were
      diligently exaggerated. The advocates of Theodosius could affirm,
      with some appearance of truth and reason, that it was impossible
      to extirpate so many warlike tribes, who were rendered desperate
      by the loss of their native country; and that the exhausted
      provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and
      husbandmen. The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile
      aspect; but the experience of past times might encourage the
      hope, that they would acquire the habits of industry and
      obedience; that their manners would be polished by time,
      education, and the influence of Christianity; and that their
      posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman
      people. 132

      charm the wild beasts of Thrace; but Theodosius enchanted the men
      and women, whose predecessors in the same country had torn

      Notwithstanding these specious arguments, and these sanguine
      expectations, it was apparent to every discerning eye, that the
      Goths would long remain the enemies, and might soon become the
      conquerors of the Roman empire. Their rude and insolent behavior
      expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials, whom
      they insulted with impunity. 133 To the zeal and valor of the
      Barbarians Theodosius was indebted for the success of his arms:
      but their assistance was precarious; and they were sometimes
      seduced, by a treacherous and inconstant disposition, to abandon
      his standard, at the moment when their service was the most
      essential. During the civil war against Maximus, a great number
      of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses of Macedonia,
      wasted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid monarch
      to expose his person, and exert his power, to suppress the rising
      flame of rebellion. 134 The public apprehensions were fortified
      by the strong suspicion, that these tumults were not the effect
      of accidental passion, but the result of deep and premeditated
      design. It was generally believed, that the Goths had signed the
      treaty of peace with a hostile and insidious spirit; and that
      their chiefs had previously bound themselves, by a solemn and
      secret oath, never to keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the
      fairest show of loyalty and friendship, and to watch the
      favorable moment of rapine, of conquest, and of revenge. But as
      the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the power of
      gratitude, several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted
      themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the
      emperor; the whole nation was insensibly divided into two
      opposite factions, and much sophistry was employed in
      conversation and dispute, to compare the obligations of their
      first, and second, engagements. The Goths, who considered
      themselves as the friends of peace, of justice, and of Rome, were
      directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honorable
      youth, distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the
      politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and
      the mild virtues of social life. But the more numerous faction
      adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf, 13411 who inflamed
      the passions, and asserted the independence, of his warlike
      followers. On one of the solemn festivals, when the chiefs of
      both parties were invited to the Imperial table, they were
      insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot the usual restraints
      of discretion and respect, and betrayed, in the presence of
      Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes. The
      emperor, who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary
      controversy, dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon
      dismissed the tumultuous assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and
      exasperated by the insolence of his rival, whose departure from
      the palace might have been the signal of a civil war, boldly
      followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid Priulf dead at his
      feet. Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of
      Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he had not
      been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial
      guards. 135 Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage, which
      disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

      The fame of Gratian, before he had accomplished the twentieth
      year of his age, was equal to that of the most celebrated
      princes. His gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his
      private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged
      the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the
      liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their
      sovereign; his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded
      by the soldiers; and the clergy considered the humble piety of
      Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues. The victory
      of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion; and
      the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of
      Theodosius to the author of his greatness, and of the public
      safety. Gratian survived those memorable events only four or five
      years; but he survived his reputation; and, before he fell a
      victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great measure, the respect
      and confidence of the Roman world.

      The remarkable alteration of his character or conduct may not be
      imputed to the arts of flattery, which had besieged the son of
      Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions
      which the that gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more
      attentive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the
      true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes. His
      apparent virtues, instead of being the hardy productions of
      experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial
      fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderness of his father
      was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages, which
      he might perhaps esteem the more highly, as he himself had been
      deprived of them; and the most skilful masters of every science,
      and of every art, had labored to form the mind and body of the
      young prince. 1 The knowledge which they painfully communicated
      was displayed with ostentation, and celebrated with lavish
      praise. His soft and tractable disposition received the fair
      impression of their judicious precepts, and the absence of
      passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason. His
      preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of
      ministers of state: 2 and, as they wisely dissembled their secret
      authority, he seemed to act with firmness, with propriety, and
      with judgment, on the most important occasions of his life and
      reign. But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not
      penetrate beyond the surface; and the skilful preceptors, who so
      accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not
      infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and
      independent principle of action which renders the laborious
      pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness, and
      almost to the existence, of the hero. As soon as time and
      accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne,
      the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his
      natural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the
      ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them; and
      amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications. A
      public sale of favor and injustice was instituted, both in the
      court and in the provinces, by the worthless delegates of his
      power, whose merit it was made sacrilege to question. 3 The
      conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and
      bishops; 4 who procured an Imperial edict to punish, as a capital
      offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of
      the divine law. 5 Among the various arts which had exercised the
      youth of Gratian, he had applied himself, with singular
      inclination and success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow,
      and to dart the javelin; and these qualifications, which might be
      useful to a soldier, were prostituted to the viler purposes of
      hunting. Large parks were enclosed for the Imperial pleasures,
      and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts; and
      Gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank,
      to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and
      boldness in the chase. The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to
      excel in an art, in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of
      his slaves, reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of
      Nero and Commodus, but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a
      stranger to their monstrous vices; and his hands were stained
      only with the blood of animals. 6 The behavior of Gratian, which
      degraded his character in the eyes of mankind, could not have
      disturbed the security of his reign, if the army had not been
      provoked to resent their peculiar injuries. As long as the young
      emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters, he
      professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of
      his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp;
      and the health, the comforts, the rewards, the honors, of his
      faithful troops, appeared to be the objects of his attentive
      concern. But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing
      taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected himself
      with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement. A
      body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic
      service of the palace; and the admirable skill, which they were
      accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia, was
      exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and enclosures
      of Gaul. Gratian admired the talents and customs of these
      favorite guards, to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his
      person; and, as if he meant to insult the public opinion, he
      frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people, with the
      dress and arms, the long bow, the sounding quiver, and the fur
      garments of a Scythian warrior. The unworthy spectacle of a Roman
      prince, who had renounced the dress and manners of his country,
      filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation. 7
      Even the Germans, so strong and formidable in the armies of the
      empire, affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of
      the savages of the North, who, in the space of a few years, had
      wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine. A
      loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and
      garrisons of the West; and as the mild indolence of Gratian
      neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the
      want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of
      fear. But the subversion of an established government is always a
      work of some real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the
      throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom, law,
      religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers,
      which had been established by the policy of Constantine. It is
      not very important to inquire from what cause the revolt of
      Britain was produced. Accident is commonly the parent of
      disorder; the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which
      was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and
      usurpers; 8 the legions of that sequestered island had been long
      famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance; 9 and the name
      of Maximus was proclaimed, by the tumultuary, but unanimous
      voice, both of the soldiers and of the provincials. The emperor,
      or the rebel,—for this title was not yet ascertained by
      fortune,—was a native of Spain, the countryman, the
      fellow-soldier, and the rival of Theodosius whose elevation he
      had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment: the
      events of his life had long since fixed him in Britain; and I
      should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage,
      which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a
      wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire. 10 But this provincial rank
      might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity; and
      if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office, he was not
      invested with the authority either of governor or general. 11 His
      abilities, and even his integrity, are acknowledged by the
      partial writers of the age; and the merit must indeed have been
      conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the
      vanquished enemy of Theodosius. The discontent of Maximus might
      incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign, and to
      encourage, perhaps, without any views of ambition, the murmurs of
      the troops. But in the midst of the tumult, he artfully, or
      modestly, refused to ascend the throne; and some credit appears
      to have been given to his own positive declaration, that he was
      compelled to accept the dangerous present of the Imperial purple.

      subject) his innocence and merit. It is singular enough, that
      Maximus should be less favorably treated by Zosimus, the partial
      adversary of his rival.]

      But there was danger likewise in refusing the empire; and from
      the moment that Maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful
      sovereign, he could not hope to reign, or even to live, if he
      confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of
      Britain. He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of
      Gratian; the youth of the island crowded to his standard, and he
      invaded Gaul with a fleet and army, which were long afterwards
      remembered, as the emigration of a considerable part of the
      British nation. 13 The emperor, in his peaceful residence of
      Paris, was alarmed by their hostile approach; and the darts which
      he idly wasted on lions and bears, might have been employed more
      honorably against the rebels. But his feeble efforts announced
      his degenerate spirit and desperate situation; and deprived him
      of the resources, which he still might have found, in the support
      of his subjects and allies. The armies of Gaul, instead of
      opposing the march of Maximus, received him with joyful and loyal
      acclamations; and the shame of the desertion was transferred from
      the people to the prince. The troops, whose station more
      immediately attached them to the service of the palace, abandoned
      the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in
      the neighborhood of Paris. The emperor of the West fled towards
      Lyons, with a train of only three hundred horse; and, in the
      cities along the road, where he hoped to find refuge, or at least
      a passage, he was taught, by cruel experience, that every gate is
      shut against the unfortunate. Yet he might still have reached, in
      safety, the dominions of his brother; and soon have returned with
      the forces of Italy and the East; if he had not suffered himself
      to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonnese
      province. Gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful
      fidelity, and the hopes of a support, which could not be
      effectual; till the arrival of Andragathius, the general of the
      cavalry of Maximus, put an end to his suspense. That resolute
      officer executed, without remorse, the orders or the intention of
      the usurper. Gratian, as he rose from supper, was delivered into
      the hands of the assassin: and his body was denied to the pious
      and pressing entreaties of his brother Valentinian. 14 The death
      of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general
      Mellobaudes, the king of the Franks; who maintained, to the last
      moment of his life, the ambiguous reputation, which is the just
      recompense of obscure and subtle policy. 15 These executions
      might be necessary to the public safety: but the successful
      usurper, whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the
      West, had the merit, and the satisfaction, of boasting, that,
      except those who had perished by the chance of war, his triumph
      was not stained by the blood of the Romans. 16

      100,000 plebeians, who settled in Bretagne. Their destined
      brides, St. Ursula with 11,000 noble, and 60,000 plebeian,

      Bretons. Macedonius also, master of the offices, suffered the
      death which he merited. Le Beau, iv. 244.—M.]

      his clemency. Si cui ille, pro ceteris sceleribus suis, minus
      crudelis fuisse videtur, (Panegyr. Vet. xii. 28.)]

      The events of this revolution had passed in such rapid
      succession, that it would have been impossible for Theodosius to
      march to the relief of his benefactor, before he received the
      intelligence of his defeat and death. During the season of
      sincere grief, or ostentatious mourning, the Eastern emperor was
      interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of
      Maximus; and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office
      which was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of
      Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper.

      The ambassador condescended to justify, or excuse, the conduct of
      his master; and to protest, in specious language, that the murder
      of Gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or
      consent, by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers. But he
      proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodosius the
      alternative of peace, or war. The speech of the ambassador
      concluded with a spirited declaration, that although Maximus, as
      a Roman, and as the father of his people, would choose rather to
      employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was
      armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected, to
      dispute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An
      immediate and peremptory answer was required; but it was
      extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy, on this important
      occasion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the
      expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honor and
      gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of
      Gratian, he had received the Imperial diadem; his patience would
      encourage the odious suspicion, that he was more deeply sensible
      of former injuries, than of recent obligations; and if he
      accepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt, of the
      assassin. Even the principles of justice, and the interest of
      society, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus;
      and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve
      the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge
      the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age.
      But, as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably
      regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced
      in the mind of a sovereign, by the sense of superior duties; and
      the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of
      an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in
      the consequences of his punishment. The assassin of Gratian had
      usurped, but he actually possessed, the most warlike provinces of
      the empire: the East was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even
      by the success, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously to be
      apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the republic had
      been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble
      conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the
      North. These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to
      dissemble his resentment, and to accept the alliance of the
      tyrant. But he stipulated, that Maximus should content himself
      with the possession of the countries beyond the Alps. The brother
      of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy,
      Africa, and the Western Illyricum; and some honorable conditions
      were inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory, and the laws,
      of the deceased emperor. 17 According to the custom of the age,
      the images of the three Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the
      veneration of the people; nor should it be lightly supposed,
      that, in the moment of a solemn reconciliation, Theodosius
      secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge. 18

      abrogavit hostia (tom. ii epist. xvii. p. 827.)]

      18 (return) [ Zosimus, l. iv. p. 251, 252. We may disclaim his
      odious suspicions; but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which
      the friends of Theodosius have absolutely forgotten, or slightly
      mentioned.]

      The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers had exposed him to
      the fatal effects of their resentment. His profound veneration
      for the Christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and
      gratitude of a powerful order, which has claimed, in every age,
      the privilege of dispensing honors, both on earth and in heaven.
      19 The orthodox bishops bewailed his death, and their own
      irreparable loss; but they were soon comforted by the discovery,
      that Gratian had committed the sceptre of the East to the hands
      of a prince, whose humble faith and fervent zeal, were supported
      by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character. Among
      the benefactors of the church, the fame of Constantine has been
      rivalled by the glory of Theodosius. If Constantine had the
      advantage of erecting the standard of the cross, the emulation of
      his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy, and
      of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world. Theodosius
      was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the
      Trinity. Although he was born of a Christian family, the maxims,
      or at least the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the
      ceremony of his initiation; till he was admonished of the danger
      of delay, by the serious illness which threatened his life,
      towards the end of the first year of his reign. Before he again
      took the field against the Goths, he received the sacrament of
      baptism 20 from Acholius, the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica: 21
      and, as the emperor ascended from the holy font, still glowing
      with the warm feelings of regeneration, he dictated a solemn
      edict, which proclaimed his own faith, and prescribed the
      religion of his subjects. “It is our pleasure (such is the
      Imperial style) that all the nations, which are governed by our
      clemency and moderation, should steadfastly adhere to the
      religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Romans; which
      faithful tradition has preserved; and which is now professed by
      the pontiff Damasus, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of
      apostolic holiness. According to the discipline of the apostles,
      and the doctrine of the gospel, let us believe the sole deity of
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; under an equal majesty,
      and a pious Trinity. We authorize the followers of this doctrine
      to assume the title of Catholic Christians; and as we judge, that
      all others are extravagant madmen, we brand them with the
      infamous name of Heretics; and declare that their conventicles
      shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches.
      Besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect to
      suffer the severe penalties, which our authority, guided by
      heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them.” 22 The
      faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction, rather
      than of inquiry; but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the
      visible landmarks of orthodoxy, which he had so prudently
      constituted, his religious opinions were never affected by the
      specious texts, the subtle arguments, and the ambiguous creeds of
      the Arian doctors. Once indeed he expressed a faint inclination
      to converse with the eloquent and learned Eunomius, who lived in
      retirement at a small distance from Constantinople. But the
      dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress
      Flaccilla, who trembled for the salvation of her husband; and the
      mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument,
      adapted to the rudest capacity. He had lately bestowed on his
      eldest son, Arcadius, the name and honors of Augustus, and the
      two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage
      of their subjects. A bishop, Amphilochius of Iconium, approached
      the throne, and after saluting, with due reverence, the person of
      his sovereign, he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar
      tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child.
      Provoked by this insolent behavior, the monarch gave orders, that
      the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence.
      But while the guards were forcing him to the door, the dexterous
      polemic had time to execute his design, by exclaiming, with a
      loud voice, “Such is the treatment, O emperor! which the King of
      heaven has prepared for those impious men, who affect to worship
      the Father, but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his
      divine Son.” Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of
      Iconium, and never forgot the important lesson, which he had
      received from this dramatic parable. 23

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part II.

      Constantinople was the principal seat and fortress of Arianism;
      and, in a long interval of forty years, 24 the faith of the
      princes and prelates, who reigned in the capital of the East, was
      rejected in the purer schools of Rome and Alexandria. The
      archiepiscopal throne of Macedonius, which had been polluted with
      so much Christian blood, was successively filled by Eudoxus and
      Damophilus. Their diocese enjoyed a free importation of vice and
      error from every province of the empire; the eager pursuit of
      religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy
      idleness of the metropolis; and we may credit the assertion of an
      intelligent observer, who describes, with some pleasantry, the
      effects of their loquacious zeal. “This city,” says he, “is full
      of mechanics and slaves, who are all of them profound
      theologians; and preach in the shops, and in the streets. If you
      desire a man to change a piece of silver, he informs you, wherein
      the Son differs from the Father; if you ask the price of a loaf,
      you are told by way of reply, that the Son is inferior to the
      Father; and if you inquire, whether the bath is ready, the answer
      is, that the Son was made out of nothing.” 25 The heretics, of
      various denominations, subsisted in peace under the protection of
      the Arians of Constantinople; who endeavored to secure the
      attachment of those obscure sectaries, while they abused, with
      unrelenting severity, the victory which they had obtained over
      the followers of the council of Nice. During the partial reigns
      of Constantius and Valens, the feeble remnant of the Homoousians
      was deprived of the public and private exercise of their
      religion; and it has been observed, in pathetic language, that
      the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the
      mountains, or to be devoured by rapacious wolves. 26 But, as
      their zeal, instead of being subdued, derived strength and vigor
      from oppression, they seized the first moments of imperfect
      freedom, which they had acquired by the death of Valens, to form
      themselves into a regular congregation, under the conduct of an
      episcopal pastor. Two natives of Cappadocia, Basil, and Gregory
      Nazianzen, 27 were distinguished above all their contemporaries,
      28 by the rare union of profane eloquence and of orthodox piety.

      These orators, who might sometimes be compared, by themselves,
      and by the public, to the most celebrated of the ancient Greeks,
      were united by the ties of the strictest friendship. They had
      cultivated, with equal ardor, the same liberal studies in the
      schools of Athens; they had retired, with equal devotion, to the
      same solitude in the deserts of Pontus; and every spark of
      emulation, or envy, appeared to be totally extinguished in the
      holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil. But the
      exaltation of Basil, from a private life to the archiepiscopal
      throne of Caesarea, discovered to the world, and perhaps to
      himself, the pride of his character; and the first favor which he
      condescended to bestow on his friend, was received, and perhaps
      was intended, as a cruel insult. 29 Instead of employing the
      superior talents of Gregory in some useful and conspicuous
      station, the haughty prelate selected, among the fifty bishoprics
      of his extensive province, the wretched village of Sasima, 30
      without water, without verdure, without society, situate at the
      junction of three highways, and frequented only by the incessant
      passage of rude and clamorous wagoners. Gregory submitted with
      reluctance to this humiliating exile; he was ordained bishop of
      Sasima; but he solemnly protests, that he never consummated his
      spiritual marriage with this disgusting bride. He afterwards
      consented to undertake the government of his native church of
      Nazianzus, 31 of which his father had been bishop above
      five-and-forty years. But as he was still conscious that he
      deserved another audience, and another theatre, he accepted, with
      no unworthy ambition, the honorable invitation, which was
      addressed to him from the orthodox party of Constantinople. On
      his arrival in the capital, Gregory was entertained in the house
      of a pious and charitable kinsman; the most spacious room was
      consecrated to the uses of religious worship; and the name of
      Anastasia was chosen to express the resurrection of the Nicene
      faith. This private conventicle was afterwards converted into a
      magnificent church; and the credulity of the succeeding age was
      prepared to believe the miracles and visions, which attested the
      presence, or at least the protection, of the Mother of God. 32
      The pulpit of the Anastasia was the scene of the labors and
      triumphs of Gregory Nazianzen; and, in the space of two years, he
      experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the
      prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary. 33 The Arians,
      who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise, represented
      his doctrine, as if he had preached three distinct and equal
      Deities; and the devout populace was excited to suppress, by
      violence and tumult, the irregular assemblies of the Athanasian
      heretics. From the cathedral of St. Sophia there issued a motley
      crowd “of common beggars, who had forfeited their claim to pity;
      of monks, who had the appearance of goats or satyrs; and of
      women, more terrible than so many Jezebels.” The doors of the
      Anastasia were broke open; much mischief was perpetrated, or
      attempted, with sticks, stones, and firebrands; and as a man lost
      his life in the affray, Gregory, who was summoned the next
      morning before the magistrate, had the satisfaction of supposing,
      that he publicly confessed the name of Christ. After he was
      delivered from the fear and danger of a foreign enemy, his infant
      church was disgraced and distracted by intestine faction. A
      stranger who assumed the name of Maximus, 34 and the cloak of a
      Cynic philosopher, insinuated himself into the confidence of
      Gregory; deceived and abused his favorable opinion; and forming a
      secret connection with some bishops of Egypt, attempted, by a
      clandestine ordination, to supplant his patron in the episcopal
      seat of Constantinople. These mortifications might sometimes
      tempt the Cappadocian missionary to regret his obscure solitude.
      But his fatigues were rewarded by the daily increase of his fame
      and his congregation; and he enjoyed the pleasure of observing,
      that the greater part of his numerous audience retired from his
      sermons satisfied with the eloquence of the preacher, 35 or
      dissatisfied with the manifold imperfections of their faith and
      practice. 36

      The Catholics of Constantinople were animated with joyful
      confidence by the baptism and edict of Theodosius; and they
      impatiently waited the effects of his gracious promise. Their
      hopes were speedily accomplished; and the emperor, as soon as he
      had finished the operations of the campaign, made his public
      entry into the capital at the head of a victorious army. The next
      day after his arrival, he summoned Damophilus to his presence,
      and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of
      subscribing the Nicene creed, or of instantly resigning, to the
      orthodox believers, the use and possession of the episcopal
      palace, the cathedral of St. Sophia, and all the churches of
      Constantinople. The zeal of Damophilus, which in a Catholic saint
      would have been justly applauded, embraced, without hesitation, a
      life of poverty and exile, 37 and his removal was immediately
      followed by the purification of the Imperial city. The Arians
      might complain, with some appearance of justice, that an
      inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred
      churches, which they were insufficient to fill; whilst the far
      greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place
      of religious worship. Theodosius was still inexorable; but as the
      angels who protected the Catholic cause were only visible to the
      eyes of faith, he prudently reenforced those heavenly legions
      with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons; and
      the church of St. Sophia was occupied by a large body of the
      Imperial guards. If the mind of Gregory was susceptible of pride,
      he must have felt a very lively satisfaction, when the emperor
      conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph; and, with
      his own hand, respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal
      throne of Constantinople. But the saint (who had not subdued the
      imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the
      mortifying consideration, that his entrance into the fold was
      that of a wolf, rather than of a shepherd; that the glittering
      arms which surrounded his person, were necessary for his safety;
      and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great
      party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impossible for him to
      despise. He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex, and
      of every age, who crowded the streets, the windows, and the roofs
      of the houses; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief,
      astonishment, and despair; and Gregory fairly confesses, that on
      the memorable day of his installation, the capital of the East
      wore the appearance of a city taken by storm, and in the hands of
      a Barbarian conqueror. 38 About six weeks afterwards, Theodosius
      declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his
      dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately
      refuse to believe, or at least to profess, the doctrine of the
      council of Nice. His lieutenant, Sapor, was armed with the ample
      powers of a general law, a special commission, and a military
      force; 39 and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with
      so much discretion and vigor, that the religion of the emperor
      was established, without tumult or bloodshed, in all the
      provinces of the East. The writings of the Arians, if they had
      been permitted to exist, 40 would perhaps contain the lamentable
      story of the persecution, which afflicted the church under the
      reign of the impious Theodosius; and the sufferings of their holy
      confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader. Yet
      there is reason to imagine, that the violence of zeal and revenge
      was, in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance; and that,
      in their adversity, the Arians displayed much less firmness than
      had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of
      Constantius and Valens. The moral character and conduct of the
      hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common
      principles of nature and religion: but a very material
      circumstance may be discovered, which tended to distinguish the
      degrees of their theological faith. Both parties, in the schools,
      as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine
      majesty of Christ; and, as we are always prone to impute our own
      sentiments and passions to the Deity, it would be deemed more
      prudent and respectful to exaggerate, than to circumscribe, the
      adorable perfections of the Son of God. The disciple of
      Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence, that he had entitled
      himself to the divine favor; while the follower of Arius must
      have been tormented by the secret apprehension, that he was
      guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonable offence, by the scanty
      praise, and parsimonious honors, which he bestowed on the Judge
      of the World. The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and
      speculative mind: but the doctrine of the Nicene creed, most
      powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion, was
      much better adapted to become popular and successful in a
      believing age.

      The hope, that truth and wisdom would be found in the assemblies
      of the orthodox clergy, induced the emperor to convene, at
      Constantinople, a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops, who
      proceeded, without much difficulty or delay, to complete the
      theological system which had been established in the council of
      Nice. The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been
      chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God; and the various
      opinions which were embraced, concerning the Second, were
      extended and transferred, by a natural analogy, to the Third
      person of the Trinity. 41 Yet it was found, or it was thought,
      necessary, by the victorious adversaries of Arianism, to explain
      the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors; to confirm
      the faith of the Catholics; and to condemn an unpopular and
      inconsistent sect of Macedonians; who freely admitted that the
      Son was consubstantial to the Father, while they were fearful of
      seeming to acknowledge the existence of Three Gods. A final and
      unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of
      the Holy Ghost: the mysterious doctrine has been received by all
      the nations, and all the churches of the Christian world; and
      their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of
      Theodosius the second rank among the general councils. 42 Their
      knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by
      tradition, or it may have been communicated by inspiration; but
      the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the
      personal authority of the Fathers of Constantinople. In an age
      when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the
      model of apostolic purity, the most worthless and corrupt were
      always the most eager to frequent, and disturb, the episcopal
      assemblies. The conflict and fermentation of so many opposite
      interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops: and
      their ruling passions were, the love of gold, and the love of
      dispute. Many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox
      piety of Theodosius, had repeatedly changed, with prudent
      flexibility, their creeds and opinions; and in the various
      revolutions of the church and state, the religion of their
      sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith. When the
      emperor suspended his prevailing influence, the turbulent synod
      was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride,
      hatred, or resentment. The death of Meletius, which happened at
      the council of Constantinople, presented the most favorable
      opportunity of terminating the schism of Antioch, by suffering
      his aged rival, Paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the
      episcopal chair. The faith and virtues of Paulinus were
      unblemished. But his cause was supported by the Western churches;
      and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs
      of discord, by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate, 43
      rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the East, which had
      been illustrated by the birth and death of the Son of God. Such
      unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of
      the assembly to dissent and to secede; and the clamorous majority
      which remained masters of the field of battle, could be compared
      only to wasps or magpies, to a flight of cranes, or to a flock of
      geese. 44

      A suspicion may possibly arise, that so unfavorable a picture of
      ecclesiastical synods has been drawn by the partial hand of some
      obstinate heretic, or some malicious infidel. But the name of the
      sincere historian who has conveyed this instructive lesson to the
      knowledge of posterity, must silence the impotent murmurs of
      superstition and bigotry. He was one of the most pious and
      eloquent bishops of the age; a saint, and a doctor of the church;
      the scourge of Arianism, and the pillar of the orthodox faith; a
      distinguished member of the council of Constantinople, in which,
      after the death of Meletius, he exercised the functions of
      president; in a word—Gregory Nazianzen himself. The harsh and
      ungenerous treatment which he experienced, 45 instead of
      derogating from the truth of his evidence, affords an additional
      proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the
      synod. Their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions
      which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the choice of the
      people, and the approbation of the emperor. But Gregory soon
      became the victim of malice and envy. The bishops of the East,
      his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation in the
      affairs of Antioch, abandoned him, without support, to the
      adverse faction of the Egyptians; who disputed the validity of
      his election, and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon, that
      prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations. The
      pride, or the humility, of Gregory prompted him to decline a
      contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice;
      and he publicly offered, not without some mixture of indignation,
      to renounce the government of a church which had been restored,
      and almost created, by his labors. His resignation was accepted
      by the synod, and by the emperor, with more readiness than he
      seems to have expected. At the time when he might have hoped to
      enjoy the fruits of his victory, his episcopal throne was filled
      by the senator Nectarius; and the new archbishop, accidentally
      recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect, was obliged
      to delay the ceremony of his consecration, till he had previously
      despatched the rites of his baptism. 46 After this remarkable
      experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates, Gregory
      retired once more to his obscure solitude of Cappadocia; where he
      employed the remainder of his life, about eight years, in the
      exercises of poetry and devotion. The title of Saint has been
      added to his name: but the tenderness of his heart, 47 and the
      elegance of his genius, reflect a more pleasing lustre on the
      memory of Gregory Nazianzen.

      natural temper when it was not hardened, or inflamed, by

      prosecute the heretics of Constantinople.]

      It was not enough that Theodosius had suppressed the insolent
      reign of Arianism, or that he had abundantly revenged the
      injuries which the Catholics sustained from the zeal of
      Constantius and Valens. The orthodox emperor considered every
      heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of
      earth; and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar
      jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty. The decrees of
      the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard
      of the faith; and the ecclesiastics, who governed the conscience
      of Theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of
      persecution. In the space of fifteen years, he promulgated at
      least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics; 48 more
      especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the
      Trinity; and to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly
      enacted, that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their
      favor, the judges should consider them as the illegal productions
      either of fraud or forgery. The penal statutes were directed
      against the ministers, the assemblies, and the persons of the
      heretics; and the passions of the legislator were expressed in
      the language of declamation and invective. I. The heretical
      teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops, or
      Presbyters, were not only excluded from the privileges and
      emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they
      were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation, if
      they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites,
      of their accursed sects. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above four
      hundred pounds sterling) was imposed on every person who should
      dare to confer, or receive, or promote, an heretical ordination:
      and it was reasonably expected, that if the race of pastors could
      be extinguished, their helpless flocks would be compelled, by
      ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the Catholic
      church. II. The rigorous prohibition of conventicles was
      carefully extended to every possible circumstance, in which the
      heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and
      Christ according to the dictates of their conscience. Their
      religious meetings, whether public or secret, by day or by night,
      in cities or in the country, were equally proscribed by the
      edicts of Theodosius; and the building, or ground, which had been
      used for that illegal purpose, was forfeited to the Imperial
      domain. III. It was supposed, that the error of the heretics
      could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds; and
      that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment.
      The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil
      excommunication; which separated them from their fellow-citizens,
      by a peculiar brand of infamy; and this declaration of the
      supreme magistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the
      insults of a fanatic populace. The sectaries were gradually
      disqualified from the possession of honorable or lucrative
      employments; and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice,
      when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians distinguished the nature
      of the Son from that of the Father, they should be incapable of
      making their wills or of receiving any advantage from
      testamentary donations. The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was
      esteemed of such magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the
      death of the offender; and the same capital punishment was
      inflicted on the Audians, or Quartodecimans, 49 who should dare
      to perpetrate the atrocious crime of celebrating on an improper
      day the festival of Easter. Every Roman might exercise the right
      of public accusation; but the office of Inquisitors of the Faith,
      a name so deservedly abhorred, was first instituted under the
      reign of Theodosius. Yet we are assured, that the execution of
      his penal edicts was seldom enforced; and that the pious emperor
      appeared less desirous to punish, than to reclaim, or terrify,
      his refractory subjects. 50

      The theory of persecution was established by Theodosius, whose
      justice and piety have been applauded by the saints: but the
      practice of it, in the fullest extent, was reserved for his rival
      and colleague, Maximus, the first, among the Christian princes,
      who shed the blood of his Christian subjects on account of their
      religious opinions. The cause of the Priscillianists, 51 a recent
      sect of heretics, who disturbed the provinces of Spain, was
      transferred, by appeal, from the synod of Bordeaux to the
      Imperial consistory of Treves; and by the sentence of the
      Prætorian præfect, seven persons were tortured, condemned, and
      executed. The first of these was Priscillian 52 himself, bishop
      of Avila, in Spain; who adorned the advantages of birth and
      fortune, by the accomplishments of eloquence and learning. 53 Two
      presbyters, and two deacons, accompanied their beloved master in
      his death, which they esteemed as a glorious martyrdom; and the
      number of religious victims was completed by the execution of
      Latronian, a poet, who rivalled the fame of the ancients; and of
      Euchrocia, a noble matron of Bordeaux, the widow of the orator
      Delphidius. 54 Two bishops who had embraced the sentiments of
      Priscillian, were condemned to a distant and dreary exile; 55 and
      some indulgence was shown to the meaner criminals, who assumed
      the merit of an early repentance. If any credit could be allowed
      to confessions extorted by fear or pain, and to vague reports,
      the offspring of malice and credulity, the heresy of the
      Priscillianists would be found to include the various
      abominations of magic, of impiety, and of lewdness. 56
      Priscillian, who wandered about the world in the company of his
      spiritual sisters, was accused of praying stark naked in the
      midst of the congregation; and it was confidently asserted, that
      the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of
      Euchrocia had been suppressed, by means still more odious and
      criminal. But an accurate, or rather a candid, inquiry will
      discover, that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of
      nature, it was not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity,
      of their lives. They absolutely condemned the use of the
      marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often disturbed by
      indiscreet separations. They enjoyed, or recommended, a total
      abstinence from all animal food; and their continual prayers,
      fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of strict and perfect
      devotion. The speculative tenets of the sect, concerning the
      person of Christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived
      from the Gnostic and Manichaean system; and this vain philosophy,
      which had been transported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted
      to the grosser spirits of the West. The obscure disciples of
      Priscillian suffered languished, and gradually disappeared: his
      tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was
      the subject of a long and vehement controversy; while some
      arraigned, and others applauded, the justice of his sentence. It
      is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of
      the most illustrious saints and bishops, Ambrose of Milan, 57 and
      Martin of Tours, 58 who, on this occasion, asserted the cause of
      toleration. They pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at
      Treves; they refused to hold communion with their episcopal
      murderers; and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution,
      his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary. The
      bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced, without hesitation, the
      eternal damnation of heretics; but they were surprised, and
      shocked, by the bloody image of their temporal death, and the
      honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of
      theology. The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was confirmed by the
      scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against Priscillian
      and his adherents. The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had
      transgressed the limits of their respective provinces. The
      secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce
      a definitive sentence, in a matter of faith, and episcopal
      jurisdiction. The bishops had disgraced themselves, by exercising
      the functions of accusers in a criminal prosecution. The cruelty
      of Ithacius, 59 who beheld the tortures, and solicited the death,
      of the heretics, provoked the just indignation of mankind; and
      the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof,
      that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest.
      Since the death of Priscillian, the rude attempts of persecution
      have been refined and methodized in the holy office, which
      assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular
      powers. The devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest
      to the magistrate, and by the magistrate to the executioner; and
      the inexorable sentence of the church, which declares the
      spiritual guilt of the offender, is expressed in the mild
      language of pity and intercession.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part III.

      Among the ecclesiastics, who illustrated the reign of Theodosius,
      Gregory Nazianzen was distinguished by the talents of an eloquent
      preacher; the reputation of miraculous gifts added weight and
      dignity to the monastic virtues of Martin of Tours; 60 but the
      palm of episcopal vigor and ability was justly claimed by the
      intrepid Ambrose. 61 He was descended from a noble family of
      Romans; his father had exercised the important office of
      Prætorian præfect of Gaul; and the son, after passing through
      the studies of a liberal education, attained, in the regular
      gradation of civil honors, the station of consular of Liguria, a
      province which included the Imperial residence of Milan. At the
      age of thirty-four, and before he had received the sacrament of
      baptism, Ambrose, to his own surprise, and to that of the world,
      was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop.
      Without the least mixture, as it is said, of art or intrigue, the
      whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the
      episcopal title; the concord and perseverance of their
      acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse; and the
      reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual
      office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and
      occupations of his former life. But the active force of his
      genius soon qualified him to exercise, with zeal and prudence,
      the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and while he
      cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal
      greatness, he condescended, for the good of the church, to direct
      the conscience of the emperors, and to control the administration
      of the empire. Gratian loved and revered him as a father; and the
      elaborate treatise on the faith of the Trinity was designed for
      the instruction of the young prince. After his tragic death, at a
      time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety, and
      for that of her son Valentinian, the archbishop of Milan was
      despatched, on two different embassies, to the court of Treves.
      He exercised, with equal firmness and dexterity, the powers of
      his spiritual and political characters; and perhaps contributed,
      by his authority and eloquence, to check the ambition of Maximus,
      and to protect the peace of Italy. 62 Ambrose had devoted his
      life, and his abilities, to the service of the church. Wealth was
      the object of his contempt; he had renounced his private
      patrimony; and he sold, without hesitation, the consecrated
      plate, for the redemption of captives. The clergy and people of
      Milan were attached to their archbishop; and he deserved the
      esteem, without soliciting the favor, or apprehending the
      displeasure, of his feeble sovereigns.

      62 (return) [ Ambrose himself (tom. ii. Epist. xxiv. p. 888—891)
      gives the emperor a very spirited account of his own embassy.]

      The government of Italy, and of the young emperor, naturally
      devolved to his mother Justina, a woman of beauty and spirit, but
      who, in the midst of an orthodox people, had the misfortune of
      professing the Arian heresy, which she endeavored to instil into
      the mind of her son. Justina was persuaded, that a Roman emperor
      might claim, in his own dominions, the public exercise of his
      religion; and she proposed to the archbishop, as a moderate and
      reasonable concession, that he should resign the use of a single
      church, either in the city or the suburbs of Milan. But the
      conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles. 63
      The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar; but the
      churches were the houses of God; and, within the limits of his
      diocese, he himself, as the lawful successor of the apostles, was
      the only minister of God. The privileges of Christianity,
      temporal as well as spiritual, were confined to the true
      believers; and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied, that his own
      theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy.
      The archbishop, who refused to hold any conference, or
      negotiation, with the instruments of Satan, declared, with modest
      firmness, his resolution to die a martyr, rather than to yield to
      the impious sacrilege; and Justina, who resented the refusal as
      an act of insolence and rebellion, hastily determined to exert
      the Imperial prerogative of her son. As she desired to perform
      her public devotions on the approaching festival of Easter,
      Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council. He obeyed the
      summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was
      followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people; they
      pressed, with impetuous zeal, against the gates of the palace;
      and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian, instead of
      pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan,
      humbly requested that he would interpose his authority, to
      protect the person of the emperor, and to restore the tranquility
      of the capital. But the promises which Ambrose received and
      communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court; and,
      during six of the most solemn days, which Christian piety had set
      apart for the exercise of religion, the city was agitated by the
      irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism. The officers of
      the household were directed to prepare, first, the Portian, and
      afterwards, the new, Basilica, for the immediate reception of the
      emperor and his mother. The splendid canopy and hangings of the
      royal seat were arranged in the customary manner; but it was
      found necessary to defend them. by a strong guard, from the
      insults of the populace. The Arian ecclesiastics, who ventured to
      show themselves in the streets, were exposed to the most imminent
      danger of their lives; and Ambrose enjoyed the merit and
      reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the
      enraged multitude.

      63 (return) [ His own representation of his principles and
      conduct (tom. ii. Epist. xx xxi. xxii. p. 852-880) is one of the
      curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity. It contains two
      letters to his sister Marcellina, with a petition to Valentinian
      and the sermon de Basilicis non madendis.]

      But while he labored to restrain the effects of their zeal, the
      pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry
      and seditious temper of the people of Milan. The characters of
      Eve, of the wife of Job, of Jezebel, of Herodias, were indecently
      applied to the mother of the emperor; and her desire to obtain a
      church for the Arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions
      which Christianity had endured under the reign of Paganism. The
      measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the
      evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the
      corporate body of merchants and manufacturers: an order was
      signified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and
      inferior servants, of the courts of justice, that, during the
      continuance of the public disorders, they should strictly confine
      themselves to their houses; and the ministers of Valentinian
      imprudently confessed, that the most respectable part of the
      citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop.
      He was again solicited to restore peace to his country, by timely
      compliance with the will of his sovereign. The reply of Ambrose
      was couched in the most humble and respectful terms, which might,
      however, be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war.
      “His life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor; but he
      would never betray the church of Christ, or degrade the dignity
      of the episcopal character. In such a cause he was prepared to
      suffer whatever the malice of the daemon could inflict; and he
      only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock, and at
      the foot of the altar; he had not contributed to excite, but it
      was in the power of God alone to appease, the rage of the people:
      he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely
      to ensue; and it was his fervent prayer, that he might not
      survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city, and perhaps the
      desolation of all Italy.” 64 The obstinate bigotry of Justina
      would have endangered the empire of her son, if, in this contest
      with the church and people of Milan, she could have depended on
      the active obedience of the troops of the palace. A large body of
      Goths had marched to occupy the Basilica, which was the object of
      the dispute: and it might be expected from the Arian principles,
      and barbarous manners, of these foreign mercenaries, that they
      would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most
      sanguinary orders. They were encountered, on the sacred
      threshold, by the archbishop, who, thundering against them a
      sentence of excommunication, asked them, in the tone of a father
      and a master, whether it was to invade the house of God, that
      they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic. The
      suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more
      effectual negotiation; and the empress was persuaded, by the
      advice of her wisest counsellors, to leave the Catholics in
      possession of all the churches of Milan; and to dissemble, till a
      more convenient season, her intentions of revenge. The mother of
      Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose; and the
      royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation, that his own
      servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent
      priest.

      the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea (p.
      84) of imitating St. Ambrose]

      The laws of the empire, some of which were inscribed with the
      name of Valentinian, still condemned the Arian heresy, and seemed
      to excuse the resistance of the Catholics. By the influence of
      Justina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the
      provinces which were subject to the court of Milan; the free
      exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the
      faith of Rimini; and the emperor declared, that all persons who
      should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution, should be
      capitally punished, as the enemies of the public peace. 65 The
      character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the
      suspicion, that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground, or
      at least a specious pretence, to the Arian ministers; who watched
      the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to
      a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and
      tyranny. A sentence of easy and honorable banishment was
      pronounced, which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without
      delay; whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile,
      and the number of his companions. But the authority of the
      saints, who have preached and practised the maxims of passive
      loyalty, appeared to Ambrose of less moment than the extreme and
      pressing danger of the church. He boldly refused to obey; and his
      refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful
      people. 66 They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop;
      the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly
      secured; and the Imperial troops, who had formed the blockade,
      were unwilling to risk the attack, of that impregnable fortress.
      The numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of
      Ambrose, embraced the fair occasion of signalizing their zeal and
      gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been
      exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he
      prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful
      institution of a loud and regular psalmody. While he maintained
      this arduous contest, he was instructed, by a dream, to open the
      earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs, Gervasius and
      Protasius, 67 had been deposited above three hundred years.
      Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect
      skeletons were found, 68 with the heads separated from their
      bodies, and a plentiful effusion of blood. The holy relics were
      presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration of the people; and
      every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably
      adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose. The bones of the
      martyrs, their blood, their garments, were supposed to contain a
      healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated
      to the most distant objects, without losing any part of its
      original virtue. The extraordinary cure of a blind man, 69 and
      the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs, appeared to
      justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose; and the truth of those
      miracles is attested by Ambrose himself, by his secretary
      Paulinus, and by his proselyte, the celebrated Augustin, who, at
      that time, professed the art of rhetoric in Milan. The reason of
      the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of Justina
      and her Arian court; who derided the theatrical representations
      which were exhibited by the contrivance, and at the expense, of
      the archbishop. 70 Their effect, however, on the minds of the
      people, was rapid and irresistible; and the feeble sovereign of
      Italy found himself unable to contend with the favorite of
      Heaven. The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the
      defence of Ambrose: the disinterested advice of Theodosius was
      the genuine result of piety and friendship; and the mask of
      religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the
      tyrant of Gaul. 71

      Sozomen, and Theodoret.]

      The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace and prosperity,
      could he have contented himself with the possession of three
      ample countries, which now constitute the three most flourishing
      kingdoms of modern Europe. But the aspiring usurper, whose sordid
      ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms,
      considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his
      future greatness, and his success was the immediate cause of his
      destruction. The wealth which he extorted 72 from the oppressed
      provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed in levying
      and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians, collected, for
      the most part, from the fiercest nations of Germany. The conquest
      of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations: and he
      secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whose
      government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects.
      But as Maximus wished to occupy, without resistance, the passes
      of the Alps, he received, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of
      Syria, the ambassador of Valentinian, and pressed him to accept
      the aid of a considerable body of troops, for the service of a
      Pannonian war. The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the
      snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship; 73 but
      the Syrian Domninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal
      favor of the court of Treves; and the council of Milan
      obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger, with a blind
      confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear.
      The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador; and
      they were admitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the
      Alps. But the crafty tyrant followed, with hasty and silent
      footsteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all
      intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armor, and the dust
      excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced the hostile
      approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan. In this extremity,
      Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence, and the
      perfidious arts of Maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and
      resolution, to stand against the Gauls and Germans, either in the
      field, or within the walls of a large and disaffected city.
      Flight was their only hope, Aquileia their only refuge; and as
      Maximus now displayed his genuine character, the brother of
      Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same
      assassin. Maximus entered Milan in triumph; and if the wise
      archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the
      usurper, he might indirectly contribute to the success of his
      arms, by inculcating, from the pulpit, the duty of resignation,
      rather than that of resistance. 74 The unfortunate Justina
      reached Aquileia in safety; but she distrusted the strength of
      the fortifications: she dreaded the event of a siege; and she
      resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius, whose
      power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the
      West. A vessel was secretly provided to transport the Imperial
      family; they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure
      harbors of Venetia, or Istria; traversed the whole extent of the
      Adriatic and Ionian Seas; turned the extreme promontory of
      Peloponnesus; and, after a long, but successful navigation,
      reposed themselves in the port of Thessalonica. All the subjects
      of Valentinian deserted the cause of a prince, who, by his
      abdication, had absolved them from the duty of allegiance; and if
      the little city of Aemona, on the verge of Italy, had not
      presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory, Maximus
      would have obtained, without a struggle, the sole possession of
      the Western empire.

      Instead of inviting his royal guests to take the palace of
      Constantinople, Theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their
      residence at Thessalonica; but these reasons did not proceed from
      contempt or indifference, as he speedily made a visit to that
      city, accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate.
      After the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy,
      the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina, that the
      guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world, as well as
      in the next; and that the public profession of the Nicene faith
      would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of
      her son, by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth
      and in heaven. The momentous question of peace or war was
      referred, by Theodosius, to the deliberation of his council; and
      the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and
      justice, had acquired, since the death of Gratian, a considerable
      degree of additional weight. The persecution of the Imperial
      family, to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his
      fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries.
      Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition
      of Maximus; and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures,
      instead of prolonging the blessings of peace, would expose the
      Eastern empire to the danger of a hostile invasion. The
      Barbarians, who had passed the Danube, had lately assumed the
      character of soldiers and subjects, but their native fierceness
      was yet untamed: and the operations of a war, which would
      exercise their valor, and diminish their numbers, might tend to
      relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression.
      Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons, which were
      approved by a majority of the council, Theodosius still hesitated
      whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no
      longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his magnanimous
      character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt
      for the safety of his infant sons, and the welfare of his
      exhausted people. In this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate
      of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man,
      the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the
      cause of her brother Valentinian. 75 The heart of Theodosius wa
      softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly
      engaged by the graces of youth and innocence: the art of Justina
      managed and directed the impulse of passion; and the celebration
      of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil
      war. The unfeeling critics, who consider every amorous weakness
      as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox
      emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the
      suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus. For my own part, I
      shall frankly confess, that I am willing to find, or even to
      seek, in the revolutions of the world, some traces of the mild
      and tender sentiments of domestic life; and amidst the crowd of
      fierce and ambitious conquerors, I can distinguish, with peculiar
      complacency, a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his
      armor from the hands of love. The alliance of the Persian king
      was secured by the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were
      persuaded to follow the standard, or to respect the frontiers, of
      an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of Theodosius,
      from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, resounded with the
      preparations of war both by land and sea. The skilful disposition
      of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers, and
      distracted the attention of Maximus. He had reason to fear, that
      a chosen body of troops, under the command of the intrepid
      Arbogastes, would direct their march along the banks of the
      Danube, and boldly penetrate through the Rhaetian provinces into
      the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors
      of Greece and Epirus, with an apparent design, that, as soon as
      the passage had been opened by a naval victory, Valentinian and
      his mother should land in Italy, proceed, without delay, to Rome,
      and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire. In the mean
      while, Theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and
      disciplined army, to encounter his unworthy rival, who, after the
      siege of Aemona, 7511 had fixed his camp in the neighborhood of
      Siscia, a city of Pannonia, strongly fortified by the broad and
      rapid stream of the Save.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part IV.

      The veterans, who still remembered the long resistance, and
      successive resources, of the tyrant Magnentius, might prepare
      themselves for the labors of three bloody campaigns. But the
      contest with his successor, who, like him, had usurped the throne
      of the West, was easily decided in the term of two months, 76 and
      within the space of two hundred miles. The superior genius of the
      emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus, who,
      in this important crisis, showed himself destitute of military
      skill, or personal courage; but the abilities of Theodosius were
      seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and
      active cavalry. The Huns, the Alani, and, after their example,
      the Goths themselves, were formed into squadrons of archers; who
      fought on horseback, and confounded the steady valor of the Gauls
      and Germans, by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. After the
      fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred
      their foaming horses into the waters of the Save, swam the river
      in the presence of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed
      the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side.
      Marcellinus, the tyrant’s brother, advanced to support them with
      the select cohorts, which were considered as the hope and
      strength of the army. The action, which had been interrupted by
      the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a
      sharp conflict, the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of
      Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror.
      Without suspending his march, to receive the loyal acclamations
      of the citizens of Aemona, Theodosius pressed forwards to
      terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who
      fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the summit of
      the Julian Alps, he descended with such incredible speed into the
      plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the
      first day; and Maximus, who found himself encompassed on all
      sides, had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city. But the
      gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy; and
      the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldiers
      and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was
      dragged from his throne, rudely stripped of the Imperial
      ornaments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple slippers; and
      conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and presence of
      Theodosius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia. The
      behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he showed
      disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the West, who had
      never been his personal enemy, and was now become the object of
      his contempt. Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the
      misfortunes to which we are exposed; and the spectacle of a proud
      competitor, now prostrate at his feet, could not fail of
      producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the
      victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity
      was checked by his regard for public justice, and the memory of
      Gratian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the
      soldiers, who drew him out of the Imperial presence, and
      instantly separated his head from his body. The intelligence of
      his defeat and death was received with sincere or well-dissembled
      joy: his son Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of
      Augustus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold
      Arbogastes; and all the military plans of Theodosius were
      successfully executed. When he had thus terminated the civil war,
      with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally
      expect, he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan,
      to restore the state of the afflicted provinces; and early in the
      spring he made, after the example of Constantine and Constantius,
      his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire.

      The orator, who may be silent without danger, may praise without
      difficulty, and without reluctance; 78 and posterity will
      confess, that the character of Theodosius 79 might furnish the
      subject of a sincere and ample panegyric. The wisdom of his laws,
      and the success of his arms, rendered his administration
      respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies.
      He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which seldom
      hold their residence in the palaces of kings. Theodosius was
      chaste and temperate; he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and
      social pleasures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous
      passions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud
      titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of
      a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raised, by
      his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent:
      Theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and
      sister; and the expressions of his regard were extended to the
      most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred. His
      familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those
      persons, who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had
      appeared before his eyes without a mask; the consciousness of
      personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental
      distinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he
      had forgotten all the injuries, while he most gratefully
      remembered all the favors and services, which he had received
      before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire. The serious or
      lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age, the rank,
      or the character of his subjects, whom he admitted into his
      society; and the affability of his manners displayed the image of
      his mind. Theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and
      virtuous: every art, every talent, of a useful, or even of an
      innocent nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and,
      except the heretics, whom he persecuted with implacable hatred,
      the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by
      the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire
      may assuredly suffice to occupy the time, and the abilities, of a
      mortal: yet the diligent prince, without aspiring to the
      unsuitable reputation of profound learning, always reserved some
      moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading.
      History, which enlarged his experience, was his favorite study.
      The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years,
      presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life:
      and it has been particularly observed, that whenever he perused
      the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly
      expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity
      and freedom. His disinterested opinion of past events was
      usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodosius
      has deserved the singular commendation, that his virtues always
      seemed to expand with his fortune: the season of his prosperity
      was that of his moderation; and his clemency appeared the most
      conspicuous after the danger and success of a civil war. The
      Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat
      of the victory, and a small number of the most obnoxious
      criminals suffered the punishment of the law. But the emperor
      showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than
      to chastise the guilty. The oppressed subjects of the West, who
      would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their
      lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to
      their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the
      aged mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of Maximus. 80 A
      character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant
      supposition of the orator Pacatus; that, if the elder Brutus
      could be permitted to revisit the earth, the stern republican
      would abjure, at the feet of Theodosius, his hatred of kings; and
      ingenuously confess, that such a monarch was the most faithful
      guardian of the happiness and dignity of the Roman people. 81

      Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have
      discerned two essential imperfections, which might, perhaps, have
      abated his recent love of despostism. The virtuous mind of
      Theodosius was often relaxed by indolence, 82 and it was
      sometimes inflamed by passion. 83 In the pursuit of an important
      object, his active courage was capable of the most vigorous
      exertions; but, as soon as the design was accomplished, or the
      danger was surmounted, the hero sunk into inglorious repose; and,
      forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his
      people, resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent, but
      trifling, pleasures of a luxurious court. The natural disposition
      of Theodosius was hasty and choleric; and, in a station where
      none could resist, and few would dissuade, the fatal consequence
      of his resentment, the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the
      consciousness of his infirmity and of his power. It was the
      constant study of his life to suppress, or regulate, the
      intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts
      enhanced the merit of his clemency. But the painful virtue which
      claims the merit of victory, is exposed to the danger of defeat;
      and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an
      act of cruelty which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian.
      Within the space of three years, the inconsistent historian of
      Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of
      Antioch, and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica.

      The lively impatience of the inhabitants of Antioch was never
      satisfied with their own situation, or with the character and
      conduct of their successive sovereigns. The Arian subjects of
      Theodosius deplored the loss of their churches; and as three
      rival bishops disputed the throne of Antioch, the sentence which
      decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two
      unsuccessful congregations. The exigencies of the Gothic war, and
      the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the
      peace, had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the
      public impositions; and the provinces of Asia, as they had not
      been involved in the distress were the less inclined to
      contribute to the relief, of Europe. The auspicious period now
      approached of the tenth year of his reign; a festival more
      grateful to the soldiers, who received a liberal donative, than
      to the subjects, whose voluntary offerings had been long since
      converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden. The edicts
      of taxation interrupted the repose, and pleasures, of Antioch;
      and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant
      crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at first, in respectful language,
      solicited the redress of their grievances. They were gradually
      incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their
      complaints as a criminal resistance; their satirical wit
      degenerated into sharp and angry invectives; and, from the
      subordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people
      insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor
      himself. Their fury, provoked by a feeble opposition, discharged
      itself on the images of the Imperial family, which were erected,
      as objects of public veneration, in the most conspicuous places
      of the city. The statues of Theodosius, of his father, of his
      wife Flaccilla, of his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, were
      insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieces, or
      dragged with contempt through the streets; and the indignities
      which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty,
      sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the
      populace. The tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the
      arrival of a body of archers: and Antioch had leisure to reflect
      on the nature and consequences of her crime. 84 According to the
      duty of his office, the governor of the province despatched a
      faithful narrative of the whole transaction: while the trembling
      citizens intrusted the confession of their crime, and the
      assurances of their repentance, to the zeal of Flavian, their
      bishop, and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius, the friend,
      and most probably the disciple, of Libanius; whose genius, on
      this melancholy occasion, was not useless to his country. 85 But
      the two capitals, Antioch and Constantinople, were separated by
      the distance of eight hundred miles; and, notwithstanding the
      diligence of the Imperial posts, the guilty city was severely
      punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense. Every rumor
      agitated the hopes and fears of the Antiochians, and they heard
      with terror, that their sovereign, exasperated by the insult
      which had been offered to his own statues, and more especially,
      to those of his beloved wife, had resolved to level with the
      ground the offending city; and to massacre, without distinction
      of age or sex, the criminal inhabitants; 86 many of whom were
      actually driven, by their apprehensions, to seek a refuge in the
      mountains of Syria, and the adjacent desert. At length,
      twenty-four days after the sedition, the general Hellebicus and
      Caesarius, master of the offices, declared the will of the
      emperor, and the sentence of Antioch. That proud capital was
      degraded from the rank of a city; and the metropolis of the East,
      stripped of its lands, its privileges, and its revenues, was
      subjected, under the humiliating denomination of a village, to
      the jurisdiction of Laodicea. 87 The baths, the Circus, and the
      theatres were shut: and, that every source of plenty and pleasure
      might at the same time be intercepted, the distribution of corn
      was abolished, by the severe instructions of Theodosius. His
      commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of
      individuals; of those who had perpetrated, and of those who had
      not prevented, the destruction of the sacred statues. The
      tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius, encompassed with armed
      soldiers, was erected in the midst of the Forum. The noblest, and
      most wealthy, of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in
      chains; the examination was assisted by the use of torture, and
      their sentence was pronounced or suspended, according to the
      judgment of these extraordinary magistrates. The houses of the
      criminals were exposed to sale, their wives and children were
      suddenly reduced, from affluence and luxury, to the most abject
      distress; and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the
      horrors of the day, 88 which the preacher of Antioch, the
      eloquent Chrysostom, has represented as a lively image of the
      last and universal judgment of the world. But the ministers of
      Theodosius performed, with reluctance, the cruel task which had
      been assigned them; they dropped a gentle tear over the
      calamities of the people; and they listened with reverence to the
      pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits, who descended in
      swarms from the mountains. 89 Hellebicus and Caesarius were
      persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence; and it was
      agreed that the former should remain at Antioch, while the latter
      returned, with all possible speed, to Constantinople; and
      presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign. The
      resentment of Theodosius had already subsided; the deputies of
      the people, both the bishop and the orator, had obtained a
      favorable audience; and the reproaches of the emperor were the
      complaints of injured friendship, rather than the stern menaces
      of pride and power. A free and general pardon was granted to the
      city and citizens of Antioch; the prison doors were thrown open;
      the senators, who despaired of their lives, recovered the
      possession of their houses and estates; and the capital of the
      East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and
      splendor. Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of
      Constantinople, who had generously interceded for their
      distressed brethren: he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with
      the government of Palestine; and dismissed the bishop of Antioch
      with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude. A
      thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius; the
      applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his
      own heart; and the emperor confessed, that, if the exercise of
      justice is the most important duty, the indulgence of mercy is
      the most exquisite pleasure, of a sovereign. 90

      scourge in her hand. An old man, says Libanius, (Orat. xii. p.

      p. 137-224) had read him with pious curiosity and diligence.]

      The sedition of Thessalonica is ascribed to a more shameful
      cause, and was productive of much more dreadful consequences.
      That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces,
      had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong
      fortifications and a numerous garrison. Botheric, the general of
      those troops, and, as it should seem from his name, a Barbarian,
      had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure
      desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The insolent and
      brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric; and
      he sternly rejected the importunate clamors of the multitude,
      who, on the day of the public games, lamented the absence of
      their favorite; and considered the skill of a charioteer as an
      object of more importance than his virtue. The resentment of the
      people was imbittered by some previous disputes; and, as the
      strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of
      the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced
      by desertion, could not save the unhappy general from their
      licentious fury. Botheric, and several of his principal officers,
      were inhumanly murdered; their mangled bodies were dragged about
      the streets; and the emperor, who then resided at Milan, was
      surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty
      of the people of Thessalonica. The sentence of a dispassionate
      judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of
      the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to
      exasperate the grief and indignation of his master.

      The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the
      dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry; and he hastily resolved,
      that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood
      of the guilty people. Yet his mind still fluctuated between the
      counsels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bishops had
      almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a
      general pardon; his passion was again inflamed by the flattering
      suggestions of his minister Rufinus; and, after Theodosius had
      despatched the messengers of death, he attempted, when it was too
      late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The punishment of a
      Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of
      the Barbarians; and the hostile preparations were concerted with
      the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy. The
      people of Thessalonica were treacherously invited, in the name of
      their sovereign, to the games of the Circus; and such was their
      insatiate avidity for those amusements, that every consideration
      of fear, or suspicion, was disregarded by the numerous
      spectators. As soon as the assembly was complete, the soldiers,
      who had secretly been posted round the Circus, received the
      signal, not of the races, but of a general massacre. The
      promiscuous carnage continued three hours, without discrimination
      of strangers or natives, of age or sex, of innocence or guilt;
      the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven
      thousand; and it is affirmed by some writers that more than
      fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the names of
      Botheric. A foreign merchant, who had probably no concern in his
      murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to supply the
      place of one of his two sons; but, while the father hesitated
      with equal tenderness, while he was doubtful to choose, and
      unwilling to condemn, the soldiers determined his suspense, by
      plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the
      defenceless youths. The apology of the assassins, that they were
      obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads, serves only to
      increase, by an appearance of order and design, the horrors of
      the massacre, which was executed by the commands of Theodosius.
      The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent
      residence at Thessalonica. The situation of the unfortunate city,
      the aspect of the streets and buildings, the dress and faces of
      the inhabitants, were familiar, and even present, to his
      imagination; and Theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of
      the existence of the people whom he destroyed. 91

      horror and pity. It is illustrated by the subsequent and unequal
      testimonies of Sozomen, (l. vii. c. 25,) Theodoret, (l. v. c.
      17,) Theophanes, (Chronograph. p. 62,) Cedrenus, (p. 317,) and
      Zonaras, (tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 34.) Zosimus alone, the partial
      enemy of Theodosius, most unaccountably passes over in silence
      the worst of his actions.]

      The respectful attachment of the emperor for the orthodox clergy,
      had disposed him to love and admire the character of Ambrose; who
      united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree. The
      friends and ministers of Theodosius imitated the example of their
      sovereign; and he observed, with more surprise than displeasure,
      that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated to the
      archbishop; who acted from the laudable persuasion, that every
      measure of civil government may have some connection with the
      glory of God, and the interest of the true religion. The monks
      and populace of Callinicum, 9111 an obscure town on the frontier
      of Persia, excited by their own fanaticism, and by that of their
      bishop, had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the Valentinians,
      and a synagogue of the Jews. The seditious prelate was condemned,
      by the magistrate of the province, either to rebuild the
      synagogue, or to repay the damage; and this moderate sentence was
      confirmed by the emperor. But it was not confirmed by the
      archbishop of Milan. 92 He dictated an epistle of censure and
      reproach, more suitable, perhaps, if the emperor had received the
      mark of circumcision, and renounced the faith of his baptism.
      Ambrose considers the toleration of the Jewish, as the
      persecution of the Christian, religion; boldly declares that he
      himself, and every true believer, would eagerly dispute with the
      bishop of Callinicum the merit of the deed, and the crown of
      martyrdom; and laments, in the most pathetic terms, that the
      execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and
      salvation of Theodosius. As this private admonition did not
      produce an immediate effect, the archbishop, from his pulpit, 93
      publicly addressed the emperor on his throne; 94 nor would he
      consent to offer the oblation of the altar, till he had obtained
      from Theodosius a solemn and positive declaration, which secured
      the impunity of the bishop and monks of Callinicum. The
      recantation of Theodosius was sincere; 95 and, during the term of
      his residence at Milan, his affection for Ambrose was continually
      increased by the habits of pious and familiar conversation.

      When Ambrose was informed of the massacre of Thessalonica, his
      mind was filled with horror and anguish. He retired into the
      country to indulge his grief, and to avoid the presence of
      Theodosius. But as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid
      silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt, he
      represented, in a private letter, the enormity of the crime;
      which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence. The
      episcopal vigor of Ambrose was tempered by prudence; and he
      contented himself with signifying 96 an indirect sort of
      excommunication, by the assurance, that he had been warned in a
      vision not to offer the oblation in the name, or in the presence,
      of Theodosius; and by the advice, that he would confine himself
      to the use of prayer, without presuming to approach the altar of
      Christ, or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that
      were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people. The
      emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by those
      of his spiritual father; and after he had bewailed the
      mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury, he
      proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his devotions in
      the great church of Milan. He was stopped in the porch by the
      archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an ambassador of
      Heaven, declared to his sovereign, that private contrition was
      not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appease the
      justice of the offended Deity. Theodosius humbly represented,
      that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, David, the man
      after God’s own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but
      of adultery. “You have imitated David in his crime, imitate then
      his repentance,” was the reply of the undaunted Ambrose. The
      rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the
      public penance of the emperor Theodosius has been recorded as one
      of the most honorable events in the annals of the church.
      According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline,
      which were established in the fourth century, the crime of
      homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years: 97 and as
      it was impossible, in the period of human life, to purge the
      accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica, the murderer
      should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour
      of his death. But the archbishop, consulting the maxims of
      religious policy, granted some indulgence to the rank of his
      illustrious penitent, who humbled in the dust the pride of the
      diadem; and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty
      reason to abridge the duration of his punishment. It was
      sufficient, that the emperor of the Romans, stripped of the
      ensigns of royalty, should appear in a mournful and suppliant
      posture; and that, in the midst of the church of Milan, he should
      humbly solicit, with sighs and tears, the pardon of his sins. 98
      In this spiritual cure, Ambrose employed the various methods of
      mildness and severity. After a delay of about eight months,
      Theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful; and the
      edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between
      the sentence and the execution, may be accepted as the worthy
      fruits of his repentance. 99 Posterity has applauded the virtuous
      firmness of the archbishop; and the example of Theodosius may
      prove the beneficial influence of those principles, which could
      force a monarch, exalted above the apprehension of human
      punishment, to respect the laws, and ministers, of an invisible
      Judge. “The prince,” says Montesquieu, “who is actuated by the
      hopes and fears of religion, may be compared to a lion, docile
      only to the voice, and tractable to the hand, of his keeper.” 100
      The motions of the royal animal will therefore depend on the
      inclination, and interest, of the man who has acquired such
      dangerous authority over him; and the priest, who holds in his
      hands the conscience of a king, may inflame, or moderate, his
      sanguinary passions. The cause of humanity, and that of
      persecution, have been asserted, by the same Ambrose, with equal
      energy, and with equal success.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part V.

      After the defeat and death of the tyrant of Gaul, the Roman world
      was in the possession of Theodosius. He derived from the choice
      of Gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the East: he
      had acquired the West by the right of conquest; and the three
      years which he spent in Italy were usefully employed to restore
      the authority of the laws, and to correct the abuses which had
      prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus, and the
      minority of Valentinian. The name of Valentinian was regularly
      inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful
      faith, of the son of Justina, appeared to require the prudent
      care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might
      have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and
      almost without a murmur, from the administration, and even from
      the inheritance, of the empire. If Theodosius had consulted the
      rigid maxims of interest and policy, his conduct would have been
      justified by his friends; but the generosity of his behavior on
      this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most
      inveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan;
      and, without stipulating any present or future advantages,
      restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces, from
      which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus. To the
      restitution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added the free and
      generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his
      successful valor had recovered from the assassin of Gratian. 101
      Satisfied with the glory which he had acquired, by revenging the
      death of his benefactor, and delivering the West from the yoke of
      tyranny, the emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople; and,
      in the peaceful possession of the East, insensibly relapsed into
      his former habits of luxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged
      his obligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal
      tenderness to the sister, of Valentinian; and posterity, which
      admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation, must
      applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory.

      101 (return) [ It is the niggard praise of Zosimus himself, (l.
      iv. p. 267.) Augustin says, with some happiness of expression,
      Valentinianum.... misericordissima veneratione restituit.]

      The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy;
      and, though she beheld the triumph of Theodosius, she was not
      allowed to influence the government of her son. 102 The
      pernicious attachment to the Arian sect, which Valentinian had
      imbibed from her example and instructions, was soon erased by the
      lessons of a more orthodox education. His growing zeal for the
      faith of Nice, and his filial reverence for the character and
      authority of Ambrose, disposed the Catholics to entertain the
      most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the
      West. 103 They applauded his chastity and temperance, his
      contempt of pleasure, his application to business, and his tender
      affection for his two sisters; which could not, however, seduce
      his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the
      meanest of his subjects. But this amiable youth, before he had
      accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was oppressed by
      domestic treason; and the empire was again involved in the
      horrors of a civil war. Arbogastes, 104 a gallant soldier of the
      nation of the Franks, held the second rank in the service of
      Gratian. On the death of his master he joined the standard of
      Theodosius; contributed, by his valor and military conduct, to
      the destruction of the tyrant; and was appointed, after the
      victory, master-general of the armies of Gaul. His real merit,
      and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the
      prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the
      allegiance of the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed
      as the pillar of the state, the bold and crafty Barbarian was
      secretly determined either to rule, or to ruin, the empire of the
      West. The important commands of the army were distributed among
      the Franks; the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the
      honors and offices of the civil government; the progress of the
      conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of
      Valentinian; and the emperor, without power and without
      intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent
      condition of a captive. 105 The indignation which he expressed,
      though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of
      youth, may be candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a
      prince, who felt that he was not unworthy to reign. He secretly
      invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a
      mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and the guardian of his
      safety. He contrived to apprise the emperor of the East of his
      helpless situation, and he declared, that, unless Theodosius
      could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape
      from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienna in Gaul, where he
      had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile
      faction. But the hopes of relief were distant, and doubtful: and,
      as every day furnished some new provocation, the emperor, without
      strength or counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate
      contest with his powerful general. He received Arbogastes on the
      throne; and, as the count approached with some appearance of
      respect, delivered to him a paper, which dismissed him from all
      his employments. “My authority,” replied Arbogastes, with
      insulting coolness, “does not depend on the smile or the frown of
      a monarch;” and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground.
      The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards,
      which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not
      without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using
      the deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself. A few
      days after this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had exposed
      his resentment and his weakness, the unfortunate Valentinian was
      found strangled in his apartment; and some pains were employed to
      disguise the manifest guilt of Arbogastes, and to persuade the
      world, that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary
      effect of his own despair. 106 His body was conducted with decent
      pomp to the sepulchre of Milan; and the archbishop pronounced a
      funeral oration to commemorate his virtues and his misfortunes.
      107 On this occasion the humanity of Ambrose tempted him to make
      a singular breach in his theological system; and to comfort the
      weeping sisters of Valentinian, by the firm assurance, that their
      pious brother, though he had not received the sacrament of
      baptism, was introduced, without difficulty, into the mansions of
      eternal bliss. 108

      most strenuously maintains the indispensable necessity of
      baptism, labors to reconcile the contradiction.]

      The prudence of Arbogastes had prepared the success of his
      ambitious designs: and the provincials, in whose breast every
      sentiment of patriotism or loyalty was extinguished, expected,
      with tame resignation, the unknown master, whom the choice of a
      Frank might place on the Imperial throne. But some remains of
      pride and prejudice still opposed the elevation of Arbogastes
      himself; and the judicious Barbarian thought it more advisable to
      reign under the name of some dependent Roman. He bestowed the
      purple on the rhetorician Eugenius; 109 whom he had already
      raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of
      master of the offices. In the course, both of his private and
      public service, the count had always approved the attachment and
      abilities of Eugenius; his learning and eloquence, supported by
      the gravity of his manners, recommended him to the esteem of the
      people; and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the
      throne, may inspire a favorable prejudice of his virtue and
      moderation. The ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately
      despatched to the court of Theodosius, to communicate, with
      affected grief, the unfortunate accident of the death of
      Valentinian; and, without mentioning the name of Arbogastes, to
      request, that the monarch of the East would embrace, as his
      lawful colleague, the respectable citizen, who had obtained the
      unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the West. 110
      Theodosius was justly provoked, that the perfidy of a Barbarian,
      should have destroyed, in a moment, the labors, and the fruit, of
      his former victory; and he was excited by the tears of his
      beloved wife, 111 to revenge the fate of her unhappy brother, and
      once more to assert by arms the violated majesty of the throne.
      But as the second conquest of the West was a task of difficulty
      and danger, he dismissed, with splendid presents, and an
      ambiguous answer, the ambassadors of Eugenius; and almost two
      years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war. Before
      he formed any decisive resolution, the pious emperor was anxious
      to discover the will of Heaven; and as the progress of
      Christianity had silenced the oracles of Delphi and Dodona, he
      consulted an Egyptian monk, who possessed, in the opinion of the
      age, the gift of miracles, and the knowledge of futurity.
      Eutropius, one of the favorite eunuchs of the palace of
      Constantinople, embarked for Alexandria, from whence he sailed up
      the Nile, as far as the city of Lycopolis, or of Wolves, in the
      remote province of Thebais. 112 In the neighborhood of that city,
      and on the summit of a lofty mountain, the holy John 113 had
      constructed, with his own hands, an humble cell, in which he had
      dwelt above fifty years, without opening his door, without seeing
      the face of a woman, and without tasting any food that had been
      prepared by fire, or any human art. Five days of the week he
      spent in prayer and meditation; but on Saturdays and Sundays he
      regularly opened a small window, and gave audience to the crowd
      of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the
      Christian world. The eunuch of Theodosius approached the window
      with respectful steps, proposed his questions concerning the
      event of the civil war, and soon returned with a favorable
      oracle, which animated the courage of the emperor by the
      assurance of a bloody, but infallible victory. 114 The
      accomplishment of the prediction was forwarded by all the means
      that human prudence could supply. The industry of the two
      master-generals, Stilicho and Timasius, was directed to recruit
      the numbers, and to revive the discipline of the Roman legions.
      The formidable troops of Barbarians marched under the ensigns of
      their national chieftains. The Iberian, the Arab, and the Goth,
      who gazed on each other with mutual astonishment, were enlisted
      in the service of the same prince; 1141 and the renowned Alaric
      acquired, in the school of Theodosius, the knowledge of the art
      of war, which he afterwards so fatally exerted for the
      destruction of Rome. 115

      The emperor of the West, or, to speak more properly, his general
      Arbogastes, was instructed by the misconduct and misfortune of
      Maximus, how dangerous it might prove to extend the line of
      defence against a skilful antagonist, who was free to press, or
      to suspend, to contract, or to multiply, his various methods of
      attack. 116 Arbogastes fixed his station on the confines of
      Italy; the troops of Theodosius were permitted to occupy, without
      resistance, the provinces of Pannonia, as far as the foot of the
      Julian Alps; and even the passes of the mountains were
      negligently, or perhaps artfully, abandoned to the bold invader.
      He descended from the hills, and beheld, with some astonishment,
      the formidable camp of the Gauls and Germans, that covered with
      arms and tents the open country which extends to the walls of
      Aquileia, and the banks of the Frigidus, 117 or Cold River. 118
      This narrow theatre of the war, circumscribed by the Alps and the
      Adriatic, did not allow much room for the operations of military
      skill; the spirit of Arbogastes would have disdained a pardon;
      his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation; and Theodosius
      was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge, by the
      chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian. Without weighing
      the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts,
      the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications
      of his rivals, assigned the post of honorable danger to the
      Goths, and cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict
      might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors. Ten
      thousand of those auxiliaries, and Bacurius, general of the
      Iberians, died bravely on the field of battle. But the victory
      was not purchased by their blood; the Gauls maintained their
      advantage; and the approach of night protected the disorderly
      flight, or retreat, of the troops of Theodosius. The emperor
      retired to the adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolate
      night, without sleep, without provisions, and without hopes; 119
      except that strong assurance, which, under the most desperate
      circumstances, the independent mind may derive from the contempt
      of fortune and of life. The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by
      the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst the active and
      vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of
      troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and to encompass
      the rear of the Eastern army. The dawn of day discovered to the
      eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger;
      but his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message
      from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination
      to desert the standard of the tyrant. The honorable and lucrative
      rewards, which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy,
      were granted without hesitation; and as ink and paper could not
      easily be procured, the emperor subscribed, on his own tablets,
      the ratification of the treaty. The spirit of his soldiers was
      revived by this seasonable reenforcement; and they again marched,
      with confidence, to surprise the camp of a tyrant, whose
      principal officers appeared to distrust, either the justice or
      the success of his arms. In the heat of the battle, a violent
      tempest, 120 such as is often felt among the Alps, suddenly arose
      from the East. The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their
      position from the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of
      dust in the faces of the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested
      their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their
      ineffectual javelins. This accidental advantage was skilfully
      improved, the violence of the storm was magnified by the
      superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they yielded without
      shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to militate
      on the side of the pious emperor. His victory was decisive; and
      the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the
      difference of their characters. The rhetorician Eugenius, who had
      almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore
      the mercy of the conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers
      separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet
      of Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the loss of a battle, in which
      he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered
      several days among the mountains. But when he was convinced that
      his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable, the
      intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans,
      and turned his sword against his own breast. The fate of the
      empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the
      legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the
      archbishop of Milan, and graciously received the submission of
      the provinces of the West. Those provinces were involved in the
      guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone
      had resisted the claims of successful usurpation. With a manly
      freedom, which might have been fatal to any other subject, the
      archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius, 1201 declined his
      correspondence, and withdrew himself from Milan, to avoid the
      odious presence of a tyrant, whose downfall he predicted in
      discreet and ambiguous language. The merit of Ambrose was
      applauded by the conqueror, who secured the attachment of the
      people by his alliance with the church; and the clemency of
      Theodosius is ascribed to the humane intercession of the
      archbishop of Milan. 121

      After the defeat of Eugenius, the merit, as well as the
      authority, of Theodosius was cheerfully acknowledged by all the
      inhabitants of the Roman world. The experience of his past
      conduct encouraged the most pleasing expectations of his future
      reign; and the age of the emperor, which did not exceed fifty
      years, seemed to extend the prospect of the public felicity. His
      death, only four months after his victory, was considered by the
      people as an unforeseen and fatal event, which destroyed, in a
      moment, the hopes of the rising generation. But the indulgence of
      ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of disease.
      122 The strength of Theodosius was unable to support the sudden
      and violent transition from the palace to the camp; and the
      increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution
      of the emperor. The opinion, and perhaps the interest, of the
      public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western
      empires; and the two royal youths, Arcadius and Honorius, who had
      already obtained, from the tenderness of their father, the title
      of Augustus, were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople
      and of Rome. Those princes were not permitted to share the danger
      and glory of the civil war; 123 but as soon as Theodosius had
      triumphed over his unworthy rivals, he called his younger son,
      Honorius, to enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to receive the
      sceptre of the West from the hands of his dying father. The
      arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid
      exhibition of the games of the Circus; and the emperor, though he
      was oppressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed by his
      presence to the public joy. But the remains of his strength were
      exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the
      spectacles of the morning. Honorius supplied, during the rest of
      the day, the place of his father; and the great Theodosius
      expired in the ensuing night. Notwithstanding the recent
      animosities of a civil war, his death was universally lamented.
      The Barbarians, whom he had vanquished and the churchmen, by whom
      he had been subdued, celebrated, with loud and sincere applause,
      the qualities of the deceased emperor, which appeared the most
      valuable in their eyes. The Romans were terrified by the
      impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration, and
      every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of Arcadius
      and Honorius revived the memory of their irreparable loss.

      calls him an impudent liar, (Godefroy, Dissert. p. 438.)]

      contemporary poet; who clearly describes the emperor’s refusal,
      and the journey of Honorius, after the victory (Claudian in iii.
      Cons. 78-125.)]

      In the faithful picture of the virtues of Theodosius, his
      imperfections have not been dissembled; the act of cruelty, and
      the habits of indolence, which tarnished the glory of one of the
      greatest of the Roman princes. An historian, perpetually adverse
      to the fame of Theodosius, has exaggerated his vices, and their
      pernicious effects; he boldly asserts, that every rank of
      subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign; and
      that every species of corruption polluted the course of public
      and private life; and that the feeble restraints of order and
      decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that
      degenerate spirit, which sacrifices, without a blush, the
      consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of
      sloth and appetite. 124 The complaints of contemporary writers,
      who deplore the increase of luxury, and depravation of manners,
      are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation.
      There are few observers, who possess a clear and comprehensive
      view of the revolutions of society; and who are capable of
      discovering the nice and secret springs of action, which impel,
      in the same uniform direction, the blind and capricious passions
      of a multitude of individuals. If it can be affirmed, with any
      degree of truth, that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless
      and dissolute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age of
      Constantine, perhaps, or of Augustus, the alteration cannot be
      ascribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gradually
      increased the stock of national riches. A long period of calamity
      or decay must have checked the industry, and diminished the
      wealth, of the people; and their profuse luxury must have been
      the result of that indolent despair, which enjoys the present
      hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity. The uncertain
      condition of their property discouraged the subjects of
      Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious
      undertakings which require an immediate expense, and promise a
      slow and distant advantage. The frequent examples of ruin and
      desolation tempted them not to spare the remains of a patrimony,
      which might, every hour, become the prey of the rapacious Goth.
      And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a
      shipwreck, or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of
      luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.

      124 (return) [ Zosimus, l. iv. p. 244.]

      The effeminate luxury, which infected the manners of courts and
      cities, had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the
      camps of the legions; and their degeneracy has been marked by the
      pen of a military writer, who had accurately studied the genuine
      and ancient principles of Roman discipline. It is the just and
      important observation of Vegetius, that the infantry was
      invariably covered with defensive armor, from the foundation of
      the city, to the reign of the emperor Gratian. The relaxation of
      discipline, and the disuse of exercise, rendered the soldiers
      less able, and less willing, to support the fatigues of the
      service; they complained of the weight of the armor, which they
      seldom wore; and they successively obtained the permission of
      laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy
      weapons of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable
      pilum, which had subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their
      feeble hands. As the use of the shield is incompatible with that
      of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to
      suffer either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and
      always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative. The
      cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, had felt the
      benefits, and adopted the use, of defensive armor; and, as they
      excelled in the management of missile weapons, they easily
      overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whose heads and
      breasts were exposed, without defence, to the arrows of the
      Barbarians. The loss of armies, the destruction of cities, and
      the dishonor of the Roman name, ineffectually solicited the
      successors of Gratian to restore the helmets and the cuirasses of
      the infantry. The enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the
      public defence; and their pusillanimous indolence may be
      considered as the immediate cause of the downfall of the empire.

      Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part I.

     Final Destruction Of Paganism.—Introduction Of The Worship Of
     Saints, And Relics, Among The Christians.

      The ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the
      only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular
      superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a
      singular event in the history of the human mind. The Christians,
      more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent
      delays of Constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder
      Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or
      secure, as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist. The
      influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the
      youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was employed to
      infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their
      Imperial proselytes. Two specious principles of religious
      jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct
      and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who
      still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the
      magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he
      neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, that the idolatrous
      worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is the most
      abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator. The
      laws of Moses, and the examples of Jewish history, 1 were
      hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild
      and universal reign of Christianity. 2 The zeal of the emperors
      was excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the Deity:
      and the temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty
      years after the conversion of Constantine.

      From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans
      preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the
      sacerdotal order. 3 Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their supreme
      jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated
      to the service of the gods; and the various questions which
      perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were
      submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave
      and learned Augurs observed the face of the heavens, and
      prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of
      birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books (their name of
      Quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally
      consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of
      contingent, events. Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the
      guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the
      duration of Rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold
      with impunity. 4 Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods,
      conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of
      the annual festival. The three Flamens of Jupiter, of Mars, and
      of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the
      three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome
      and of the universe. The King of the Sacrifices represented the
      person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious
      functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The
      confraternities of the Salians, the Lupercals, &c., practised
      such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every
      reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending
      themselves to the favor of the immortal gods. The authority,
      which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of
      the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of
      monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire. But the dignity
      of their sacred character was still protected by the laws, and
      manners of their country; and they still continued, more
      especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital,
      and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their
      ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. Their robes of purple,
      chariotz of state, and sumptuous entertainments, attracted the
      admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated
      lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally
      supported the splendor of the priesthood, and all the expenses of
      the religious worship of the state. As the service of the altar
      was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans,
      after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of
      pontiff, or of augur; the seats of Cicero 5 and Pompey were
      filled, in the fourth century, by the most illustrious members of
      the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional
      splendor on their sacerdotal character. The fifteen priests, who
      composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished
      rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the Christian
      emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were
      appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. But when Gratian
      ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he
      sternly rejected those profane symbols; 6 applied to the service
      of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and
      vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the
      ancient fabric of Roman superstition, which was supported by the
      opinions and habits of eleven hundred years. Paganism was still
      the constitutional religion of the senate. The hall, or temple,
      in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of
      Victory; 7 a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing
      garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her
      outstretched hand. 8 The senators were sworn on the altar of the
      goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and
      a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of
      their public deliberations. 9 The removal of this ancient
      monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the
      superstition of the Romans. The altar of Victory was again
      restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more
      banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian. 10 But the
      emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to
      the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or
      chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people;
      and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was
      offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice. 11

      of Rome: 12 and it was only by their absence, that they could
      express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a
      Pagan majority. In that assembly, the dying embers of freedom
      were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of

      with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and præfect of
      the city. The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest
      zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and his religious
      antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy
      of his moral virtues. 15 The orator, whose petition is extant to
      the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and
      danger of the office which he had assumed. He cautiously avoids
      every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his
      sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his
      only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of
      rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus
      endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by
      displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he
      insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were
      consecrated to the service of the gods, was a measure unworthy of
      his liberal and disinterested character; and he maintains, that
      the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy,
      if they were no longer celebrated at the expense, as well as in
      the name, of the republic. Even scepticism is made to supply an
      apology for superstition. The great and incomprehensible secret
      of the universe eludes the inquiry of man. Where reason cannot
      instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation
      seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful
      attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the
      sanction of ages. If those ages have been crowned with glory and
      prosperity, if the devout people have frequently obtained the
      blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it
      must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary
      practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any
      rash innovations. The test of antiquity and success was applied
      with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and Rome
      herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the
      city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before
      the tribunal of the emperors. “Most excellent princes,” says the
      venerable matron, “fathers of your country! pity and respect my
      age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of
      piety. Since I do not repent, permit me to continue in the
      practice of my ancient rites. Since I am born free, allow me to
      enjoy my domestic institutions. This religion has reduced the
      world under my laws. These rites have repelled Hannibal from the
      city, and the Gauls from the Capitol. Were my gray hairs reserved
      for such intolerable disgrace? I am ignorant of the new system
      that I am required to adopt; but I am well assured, that the
      correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious
      office.” 16 The fears of the people supplied what the discretion
      of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities, which
      afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously
      imputed, by the Pagans, to the new religion of Christ and of
      Constantine.

      style he was supposed, by his friends, to equal or excel,
      (Macrob. Saturnal. l. v. c. i.) But the luxcriancy of Symmachus
      consists of barren leaves, without fruits, and even without
      flowers. Few facts, and few sentiments, can be extracted from his
      verbose correspondence.]

      But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm
      and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who
      fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the
      advocate of Rome. In this controversy, Ambrose condescends to
      speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask, with some
      contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an
      imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of those victories,
      which were sufficiently explained by the valor and discipline of
      the legions. He justly derides the absurd reverence for
      antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements
      of art, and to replunge the human race into their original
      barbarism. From thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and
      theological tone, he pronounces, that Christianity alone is the
      doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of
      Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of
      error, to the abyss of eternal perdition. 17 Arguments like
      these, when they were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power
      to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same
      arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth
      of a conqueror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph
      at the chariot-wheels of Theodosius. 18 In a full meeting of the
      senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the
      republic, the important question, Whether the worship of Jupiter,
      or that of Christ, should be the religion of the Romans. 1811 The
      liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed
      by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the
      arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it
      might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch. On a
      regular division of the senate, Jupiter was condemned and
      degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather
      surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to
      declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still
      attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. 19 The hasty
      conversion of the senate must be attributed either to
      supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant
      proselytes betrayed, on every favorable occasion, their secret
      disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation. But
      they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of
      the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority
      of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the
      entreaties of their wives and children, 20 who were instigated
      and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East. The
      edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the
      rest of the nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi,
      embraced the Christian religion; and “the luminaries of the
      world, the venerable assembly of Catos (such are the high-flown
      expressions of Prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves of
      their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to
      assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the
      pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs.” 21 The
      citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace,
      who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches
      of the Lateran, and Vatican, with an incessant throng of devout
      proselytes. The decrees of the senate, which proscribed the
      worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of the
      Romans; 22 the splendor of the Capitol was defaced, and the
      solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt. 23 Rome
      submitted to the yoke of the Gospel; and the vanquished provinces
      had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of
      Rome. 2311

      The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry, if it
      may deserve that name, of Prudentius; who composed his two books
      against Symmachus (A.D. 404) while that senator was still alive.
      It is whimsical enough that Montesquieu (Considerations, &c. c.
      xix. tom. iii. p. 487) should overlook the two professed
      antagonists of Symmachus, and amuse himself with descanting on

      1811 (return) [ M. Beugnot (in his Histoire de la Destruction du
      Paganisme en Occident, i. p. 483-488) questions, altogether, the
      truth of this statement. It is very remarkable that Zosimus and
      Prudentius concur in asserting the fact of the question being
      solemnly deliberated by the senate, though with directly opposite
      results. Zosimus declares that the majority of the assembly
      adhered to the ancient religion of Rome; Gibbon has adopted the
      authority of Prudentius, who, as a Latin writer, though a poet,
      deserves more credit than the Greek historian. Both concur in
      placing this scene after the second triumph of Theodosius; but it
      has been almost demonstrated (and Gibbon—see the preceding
      note—seems to have acknowledged this) by Pagi and Tillemont, that
      Theodosius did not visit Rome after the defeat of Eugenius. M.
      Beugnot urges, with much force, the improbability that the
      Christian emperor would submit such a question to the senate,
      whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on one occasion,
      which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of her
      ancient privileges. The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an
      event so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of
      Christianity, is of considerable weight. M. Beugnot would ascribe
      the whole scene to the poetic imagination of Prudentius; but I
      must observe, that, however Prudentius is sometimes elevated by
      the grandeur of his subject to vivid and eloquent language, this
      flight of invention would be so much bolder and more vigorous

      sacrifices ceased, not because they were positively prohibited,
      but because the public treasury would no longer bear the expense.

      were not under the same regulations with those of the capital,
      continued to take place. In Rome itself, many pagan ceremonies,
      which were without sacrifice, remained in full force. The gods,
      therefore, were invoked, the temples were frequented, the
      pontificates inscribed, according to ancient usage, among the
      family titles of honor; and it cannot be asserted that idolatry
      was completely destroyed by Theodosius. See Beugnot, p. 491.—M.]




      Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part II.

      The filial piety of the emperors themselves engaged them to
      proceed, with some caution and tenderness, in the reformation of
      the eternal city. Those absolute monarchs acted with less regard
      to the prejudices of the provincials. The pious labor which had
      been suspended near twenty years since the death of Constantius,
      24 was vigorously resumed, and finally accomplished, by the zeal
      of Theodosius. Whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the
      Goths, not for the glory, but for the safety, of the republic, he
      ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects, by some
      acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven, but
      which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human
      prudence. The success of his first experiments against the Pagans
      encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts
      of proscription: the same laws which had been originally
      published in the provinces of the East, were applied, after the
      defeat of Maximus, to the whole extent of the Western empire; and
      every victory of the orthodox Theodosius contributed to the
      triumph of the Christian and Catholic faith. 25 He attacked
      superstition in her most vital part, by prohibiting the use of
      sacrifices, which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous;
      and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the
      impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victim, 26
      every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt
      the general practice of immolation, which essentially constituted
      the religion of the Pagans. As the temples had been erected for
      the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince
      to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending
      against the laws which he had enacted. A special commission was
      granted to Cynegius, the Prætorian præfect of the East, and
      afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius, two officers of
      distinguished rank in the West; by which they were directed to
      shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of
      idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to
      confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the
      emperor, of the church, or of the army. 27 Here the desolation
      might have stopped: and the naked edifices, which were no longer
      employed in the service of idolatry, might have been protected
      from the destructive rage of fanaticism. Many of those temples
      were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian
      architecture; and the emperor himself was interested not to
      deface the splendor of his own cities, or to diminish the value
      of his own possessions. Those stately edifices might be suffered
      to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ.
      In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into
      magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and
      perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently
      purified by holy rites, the worship of the true Deity might be
      allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry. But as long as
      they subsisted, the Pagans fondly cherished the secret hope, that
      an auspicious revolution, a second Julian, might again restore
      the altars of the gods: and the earnestness with which they
      addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne, 28 increased
      the zeal of the Christian reformers to extirpate, without mercy,
      the root of superstition. The laws of the emperors exhibit some
      symptoms of a milder disposition: 29 but their cold and languid
      efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and
      rapine, which was conducted, or rather impelled, by the spiritual
      rulers of the church. In Gaul, the holy Martin, bishop of Tours,
      30 marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the
      idols, the temples, and the consecrated trees of his extensive
      diocese; and, in the execution of this arduous task, the prudent
      reader will judge whether Martin was supported by the aid of
      miraculous powers, or of carnal weapons. In Syria, the divine and
      excellent Marcellus, 31 as he is styled by Theodoret, a bishop
      animated with apostolic fervor, resolved to level with the ground
      the stately temples within the diocese of Apamea. His attack was
      resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of
      Jupiter had been constructed. The building was seated on an
      eminence: on each of the four sides, the lofty roof was supported
      by fifteen massy columns, sixteen feet in circumference; and the
      large stone, of which they were composed, were firmly cemented
      with lead and iron. The force of the strongest and sharpest tools
      had been tried without effect. It was found necessary to
      undermine the foundations of the columns, which fell down as soon
      as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire; and
      the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the
      allegory of a black daemon, who retarded, though he could not
      defeat, the operations of the Christian engineers. Elated with
      victory, Marcellus took the field in person against the powers of
      darkness; a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched
      under the episcopal banner, and he successively attacked the
      villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea. Whenever
      any resistance or danger was apprehended, the champion of the
      faith, whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly,
      placed himself at a convenient distance, beyond the reach of
      darts. But this prudence was the occasion of his death: he was
      surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics; and the
      synod of the province pronounced, without hesitation, that the
      holy Marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of God. In
      the support of this cause, the monks, who rushed with tumultuous
      fury from the desert, distinguished themselves by their zeal and
      diligence. They deserved the enmity of the Pagans; and some of
      them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance; of
      avarice, which they gratified with holy plunder, and of
      intemperance, which they indulged at the expense of the people,
      who foolishly admired their tattered garments, loud psalmody, and
      artificial paleness. 32 A small number of temples was protected
      by the fears, the venality, the taste, or the prudence, of the
      civil and ecclesiastical governors. The temple of the Celestial
      Venus at Carthage, whose sacred precincts formed a circumference
      of two miles, was judiciously converted into a Christian church;
      33 and a similar consecration has preserved inviolate the
      majestic dome of the Pantheon at Rome. 34 But in almost every
      province of the Roman world, an army of fanatics, without
      authority, and without discipline, invaded the peaceful
      inhabitants; and the ruin of the fairest structures of antiquity
      still displays the ravages of those Barbarians, who alone had
      time and inclination to execute such laborious destruction.

      In this wide and various prospect of devastation, the spectator
      may distinguish the ruins of the temple of Serapis, at
      Alexandria. 35 Serapis does not appear to have been one of the
      native gods, or monsters, who sprung from the fruitful soil of
      superstitious Egypt. 36 The first of the Ptolemies had been
      commanded, by a dream, to import the mysterious stranger from the
      coast of Pontus, where he had been long adored by the inhabitants
      of Sinope; but his attributes and his reign were so imperfectly
      understood, that it became a subject of dispute, whether he
      represented the bright orb of day, or the gloomy monarch of the
      subterraneous regions. 37 The Egyptians, who were obstinately
      devoted to the religion of their fathers, refused to admit this
      foreign deity within the walls of their cities. 38 But the
      obsequious priests, who were seduced by the liberality of the
      Ptolemies, submitted, without resistance, to the power of the god
      of Pontus: an honorable and domestic genealogy was provided; and
      this fortunate usurper was introduced into the throne and bed of
      Osiris, 39 the husband of Isis, and the celestial monarch of
      Egypt. Alexandria, which claimed his peculiar protection, gloried
      in the name of the city of Serapis. His temple, 40 which rivalled
      the pride and magnificence of the Capitol, was erected on the
      spacious summit of an artificial mount, raised one hundred steps
      above the level of the adjacent parts of the city; and the
      interior cavity was strongly supported by arches, and distributed
      into vaults and subterraneous apartments. The consecrated
      buildings were surrounded by a quadrangular portico; the stately
      halls, and exquisite statues, displayed the triumph of the arts;
      and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved in the
      famous Alexandrian library, which had arisen with new splendor
      from its ashes. 41 After the edicts of Theodosius had severely
      prohibited the sacrifices of the Pagans, they were still
      tolerated in the city and temple of Serapis; and this singular
      indulgence was imprudently ascribed to the superstitious terrors
      of the Christians themselves; as if they had feared to abolish
      those ancient rites, which could alone secure the inundations of
      the Nile, the harvests of Egypt, and the subsistence of
      Constantinople. 42

      At that time 43 the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria was
      filled by Theophilus, 44 the perpetual enemy of peace and virtue;
      a bold, bad man, whose hands were alternately polluted with gold
      and with blood. His pious indignation was excited by the honors
      of Serapis; and the insults which he offered to an ancient temple
      of Bacchus, 4411 convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more
      important and dangerous enterprise. In the tumultuous capital of
      Egypt, the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a
      civil war. The votaries of Serapis, whose strength and numbers
      were much inferior to those of their antagonists, rose in arms at
      the instigation of the philosopher Olympius, 45 who exhorted them
      to die in the defence of the altars of the gods. These Pagan
      fanatics fortified themselves in the temple, or rather fortress,
      of Serapis; repelled the besiegers by daring sallies, and a
      resolute defence; and, by the inhuman cruelties which they
      exercised on their Christian prisoners, obtained the last
      consolation of despair. The efforts of the prudent magistrate
      were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce, till the
      answer of Theodosius should determine the fate of Serapis. The
      two parties assembled, without arms, in the principal square; and
      the Imperial rescript was publicly read. But when a sentence of
      destruction against the idols of Alexandria was pronounced, the
      Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst the
      unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation,
      retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight
      or obscurity, the resentment of their enemies. Theophilus
      proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis, without any other
      difficulties, than those which he found in the weight and
      solidity of the materials: but these obstacles proved so
      insuperable, that he was obliged to leave the foundations; and to
      content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of
      rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to
      make room for a church, erected in honor of the Christian
      martyrs. The valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or
      destroyed; and near twenty years afterwards, the appearance of
      the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every
      spectator, whose mind was not totally darkened by religious
      prejudice. 46 The compositions of ancient genius, so many of
      which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been
      excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and
      instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the
      avarice of the archbishop, 47 might have been satiated with the
      rich spoils, which were the reward of his victory. While the
      images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted, and
      those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken, and
      cast into the streets, Theophilus labored to expose the frauds
      and vices of the ministers of the idols; their dexterity in the
      management of the loadstone; their secret methods of introducing
      a human actor into a hollow statue; 4711 and their scandalous
      abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting
      females. 48 Charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of
      credit, as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested
      spirit of superstition. But the same spirit is equally prone to
      the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy;
      and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection, that it is
      much less difficult to invent a fictitious story, than to support
      a practical fraud. The colossal statue of Serapis 49 was involved
      in the ruin of his temple and religion. A great number of plates
      of different metals, artificially joined together, composed the
      majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the
      walls of the sanctuary. The aspect of Serapis, his sitting
      posture, and the sceptre, which he bore in his left hand, were
      extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter. He
      was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket, or bushel, which
      was placed on his head; and by the emblematic monster which he
      held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching
      into three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads
      of a dog, a lion, and a wolf. It was confidently affirmed, that
      if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the
      god, the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their
      original chaos. An intrepid soldier, animated by zeal, and armed
      with a weighty battle-axe, ascended the ladder; and even the
      Christian multitude expected, with some anxiety, the event of the
      combat. 50 He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of
      Serapis; the cheek fell to the ground; the thunder was still
      silent, and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve
      their accustomed order and tranquillity. The victorious soldier
      repeated his blows: the huge idol was overthrown, and broken in
      pieces; and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged
      through the streets of Alexandria. His mangled carcass was burnt
      in the Amphitheatre, amidst the shouts of the populace; and many
      persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the
      impotence of their tutelar deity. The popular modes of religion,
      that propose any visible and material objects of worship, have
      the advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the
      senses of mankind: but this advantage is counterbalanced by the
      various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the
      idolater is exposed. It is scarcely possible, that, in every
      disposition of mind, he should preserve his implicit reverence
      for the idols, or the relics, which the naked eye, and the
      profane hand, are unable to distinguish from the most common
      productions of art or nature; and if, in the hour of danger,
      their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own
      preservation, he scorns the vain apologies of his priests, and
      justly derides the object, and the folly, of his superstitious
      attachment. 51 After the fall of Serapis, some hopes were still
      entertained by the Pagans, that the Nile would refuse his annual
      supply to the impious masters of Egypt; and the extraordinary
      delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the
      river-god. But this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell
      of the waters. They suddenly rose to such an unusual height, as
      to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation
      of a deluge; till the peaceful river again subsided to the
      well-known and fertilizing level of sixteen cubits, or about
      thirty English feet. 52

      The temples of the Roman empire were deserted, or destroyed; but
      the ingenious superstition of the Pagans still attempted to elude
      the laws of Theodosius, by which all sacrifices had been severely
      prohibited. The inhabitants of the country, whose conduct was
      less opposed to the eye of malicious curiosity, disguised their
      religious, under the appearance of convivial, meetings. On the
      days of solemn festivals, they assembled in great numbers under
      the spreading shade of some consecrated trees; sheep and oxen
      were slaughtered and roasted; and this rural entertainment was
      sanctified by the use of incense, and by the hymns which were
      sung in honor of the gods. But it was alleged, that, as no part
      of the animal was made a burnt-offering, as no altar was provided
      to receive the blood, and as the previous oblation of salt cakes,
      and the concluding ceremony of libations, were carefully omitted,
      these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt, or
      penalty, of an illegal sacrifice. 53 Whatever might be the truth
      of the facts, or the merit of the distinction, 54 these vain
      pretences were swept away by the last edict of Theodosius, which
      inflicted a deadly wound on the superstition of the Pagans. 55
      5511 This prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and
      comprehensive terms. “It is our will and pleasure,” says the
      emperor, “that none of our subjects, whether magistrates or
      private citizens, however exalted or however humble may be their
      rank and condition, shall presume, in any city or in any place,
      to worship an inanimate idol, by the sacrifice of a guiltless
      victim.” The act of sacrificing, and the practice of divination
      by the entrails of the victim, are declared (without any regard
      to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high treason against the
      state, which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty. The
      rites of Pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and
      atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth and
      honor of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and
      libations of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and
      the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household
      gods, are included in this rigorous proscription. The use of any
      of these profane and illegal ceremonies, subjects the offender to
      the forfeiture of the house or estate, where they have been
      performed; and if he has artfully chosen the property of another
      for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to discharge,
      without delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or
      more than one thousand pounds sterling. A fine, not less
      considerable, is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies
      of religion, who shall neglect the duty of their respective
      stations, either to reveal, or to punish, the guilt of idolatry.
      Such was the persecuting spirit of the laws of Theodosius, which
      were repeatedly enforced by his sons and grandsons, with the loud
      and unanimous applause of the Christian world. 56

      beginning of the fifth century, speaks of the cross as Signum
      quod perhibent esse crucis Dei, Magnis qui colitur solus
      inurbibus. In the middle of the same century, Maximus, bishop of
      Turin, writes against the heathen deities as if their worship was
      still in full vigor in the neighborhood of his city. Augustine
      complains of the encouragement of the Pagan rites by heathen
      landowners; and Zeno of Verona, still later, reproves the apathy
      of the Christian proprietors in conniving at this abuse. (Compare
      Neander, ii. p. 169.) M. Beugnot shows that this was the case
      throughout the north and centre of Italy and in Sicily. But
      neither of these authors has adverted to one fact, which must
      have tended greatly to retard the progress of Christianity in
      these quarters. It was still chiefly a slave population which
      cultivated the soil; and however, in the towns, the better class
      of Christians might be eager to communicate “the blessed liberty
      of the gospel” to this class of mankind; however their condition
      could not but be silently ameliorated by the humanizing influence
      of Christianity; yet, on the whole, no doubt the servile class
      would be the least fitted to receive the gospel; and its general
      propagation among them would be embarrassed by many peculiar
      difficulties. The rural population was probably not entirely

      Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part III.

      In the cruel reigns of Decius and Diocletian, Christianity had
      been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary
      religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were
      entertained of a dark and dangerous faction, were, in some
      measure, countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid
      conquests of the Catholic church. But the same excuses of fear
      and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who
      violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel. The
      experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly,
      of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already
      exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols;
      and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship,
      might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the
      religious costumes of their ancestors. Had the Pagans been
      animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the
      primitive believers, the triumph of the Church must have been
      stained with blood; and the martyrs of Jupiter and Apollo might
      have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives
      and fortunes at the foot of their altars. But such obstinate zeal
      was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of Polytheism.
      The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were
      broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were
      directed; and the ready obedience of the Pagans protected them
      from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code. 57 Instead
      of asserting, that the authority of the gods was superior to that
      of the emperor, they desisted, with a plaintive murmur, from the
      use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned. If
      they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion, or by the
      hopes of concealment, to indulge their favorite superstition,
      their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian
      magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness,
      by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the
      Gospel. The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of
      these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal
      motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly
      imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful,
      they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere
      invocation of the gods of antiquity. 58 If the Pagans wanted
      patience to suffer they wanted spirit to resist; and the
      scattered myriads, who deplored the ruin of the temples, yielded,
      without a contest, to the fortune of their adversaries. The
      disorderly opposition 59 of the peasants of Syria, and the
      populace of Alexandria, to the rage of private fanaticism, was
      silenced by the name and authority of the emperor. The Pagans of
      the West, without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius,
      disgraced, by their partial attachment, the cause and character
      of the usurper. The clergy vehemently exclaimed, that he
      aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy; that,
      by his permission, the altar of victory was again restored; and
      that the idolatrous symbols of Jupiter and Hercules were
      displayed in the field, against the invincible standard of the
      cross. But the vain hopes of the Pagans were soon annihilated by
      the defeat of Eugenius; and they were left exposed to the
      resentment of the conqueror, who labored to deserve the favor of
      Heaven by the extirpation of idolatry. 60

      A nation of slaves is always prepared to applaud the clemency of
      their master, who, in the abuse of absolute power, does not
      proceed to the last extremes of injustice and oppression.
      Theodosius might undoubtedly have proposed to his Pagan subjects
      the alternative of baptism or of death; and the eloquent Libanius
      has praised the moderation of a prince, who never enacted, by any
      positive law, that all his subjects should immediately embrace
      and practise the religion of their sovereign. 61 The profession
      of Christianity was not made an essential qualification for the
      enjoyment of the civil rights of society, nor were any peculiar
      hardships imposed on the sectaries, who credulously received the
      fables of Ovid, and obstinately rejected the miracles of the
      Gospel. The palace, the schools, the army, and the senate, were
      filled with declared and devout Pagans; they obtained, without
      distinction, the civil and military honors of the empire. 6111
      Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius
      by the consular dignity, which he bestowed on Symmachus; 62 and
      by the personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius; 63 and
      the two eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required
      either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions. The
      Pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and
      writing; the historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius,
      Zosimus, 64 and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato,
      betray the most furious animosity, and contain the sharpest
      invectives, against the sentiments and conduct of their
      victorious adversaries. If these audacious libels were publicly
      known, we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes,
      who viewed, with a smile of contempt, the last struggles of
      superstition and despair. 65 But the Imperial laws, which
      prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of Paganism, were
      rigidly executed; and every hour contributed to destroy the
      influence of a religion, which was supported by custom, rather
      than by argument. The devotion or the poet, or the philosopher,
      may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study; but
      the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid
      foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which
      derive their force from imitation and habit. The interruption of
      that public exercise may consummate, in the period of a few
      years, the important work of a national revolution. The memory of
      theological opinions cannot long be preserved, without the
      artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of books. 66 The
      ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the blind
      hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by
      their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of
      the age; and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the
      support and propagation of the new doctrine, which spiritual
      hunger at first compelled them to accept. The generation that
      arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws,
      was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church: and so
      rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of Paganism, that only
      twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius, the faint and
      minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the
      legislator. 67

      of which the inscription is still extant. Fragments of his poems

      The ruin of the Pagan religion is described by the sophists as a
      dreadful and amazing prodigy, which covered the earth with
      darkness, and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of
      night. They relate, in solemn and pathetic strains, that the
      temples were converted into sepulchres, and that the holy places,
      which had been adorned by the statues of the gods, were basely
      polluted by the relics of Christian martyrs. “The monks” (a race
      of filthy animals, to whom Eunapius is tempted to refuse the name
      of men) “are the authors of the new worship, which, in the place
      of those deities who are conceived by the understanding, has
      substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves. The heads,
      salted and pickled, of those infamous malefactors, who for the
      multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious
      death; their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash,
      and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the
      sentence of the magistrate; such” (continues Eunapius) “are the
      gods which the earth produces in our days; such are the martyrs,
      the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the
      Deity, whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the
      veneration of the people.” 68 Without approving the malice, it is
      natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist, the
      spectator of a revolution, which raised those obscure victims of
      the laws of Rome to the rank of celestial and invisible
      protectors of the Roman empire. The grateful respect of the
      Christians for the martyrs of the faith, was exalted, by time and
      victory, into religious adoration; and the most illustrious of
      the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honors
      of the martyrs. One hundred and fifty years after the glorious
      deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Vatican and the Ostian road
      were distinguished by the tombs, or rather by the trophies, of
      those spiritual heroes. 69 In the age which followed the
      conversion of Constantine, the emperors, the consuls, and the
      generals of armies, devoutly visited the sepulchres of a
      tentmaker and a fisherman; 70 and their venerable bones were
      deposited under the altars of Christ, on which the bishops of the
      royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice. 71 The new
      capital of the Eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and
      domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent
      provinces. The bodies of St. Andrew, St. Luke, and St. Timothy,
      had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves, from
      whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of
      the apostles, which the magnificence of Constantine had founded
      on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus. 72 About fifty years
      afterwards, the same banks were honored by the presence of
      Samuel, the judge and prophet of the people of Israel. His ashes,
      deposited in a golden vase, and covered with a silken veil, were
      delivered by the bishops into each other’s hands. The relics of
      Samuel were received by the people with the same joy and
      reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet; the
      highways, from Palestine to the gates of Constantinople, were
      filled with an uninterrupted procession; and the emperor Arcadius
      himself, at the head of the most illustrious members of the
      clergy and senate, advanced to meet his extraordinary guest, who
      had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings. 73 The
      example of Rome and Constantinople confirmed the faith and
      discipline of the Catholic world. The honors of the saints and
      martyrs, after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason,
      74 were universally established; and in the age of Ambrose and
      Jerom, something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a
      Christian church, till it had been consecrated by some portion of
      holy relics, which fixed and inflamed the devotion of the
      faithful.

      In the long period of twelve hundred years, which elapsed between
      the reign of Constantine and the reformation of Luther, the
      worship of saints and relics corrupted the pure and perfect
      simplicity of the Christian model: and some symptoms of
      degeneracy may be observed even in the first generations which
      adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation.

      I. The satisfactory experience, that the relics of saints were
      more valuable than gold or precious stones, 75 stimulated the
      clergy to multiply the treasures of the church. Without much
      regard for truth or probability, they invented names for
      skeletons, and actions for names. The fame of the apostles, and
      of the holy men who had imitated their virtues, was darkened by
      religious fiction. To the invincible band of genuine and
      primitive martyrs, they added myriads of imaginary heroes, who
      had never existed, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous
      legendaries; and there is reason to suspect, that Tours might not
      be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were
      adored, instead of those of a saint. 76 A superstitious practice,
      which tended to increase the temptations of fraud, and credulity,
      insensibly extinguished the light of history, and of reason, in
      the Christian world.

      Polycarp the martyr.]

      frequently?]

      II. But the progress of superstition would have been much less
      rapid and victorious, if the faith of the people had not been
      assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles, to
      ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious
      relics. In the reign of the younger Theodosius, Lucian, 77 a
      presbyter of Jerusalem, and the ecclesiastical minister of the
      village of Caphargamala, about twenty miles from the city,
      related a very singular dream, which, to remove his doubts, had
      been repeated on three successive Saturdays. A venerable figure
      stood before him, in the silence of the night, with a long beard,
      a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himself by the name of
      Gamaliel, and revealed to the astonished presbyter, that his own
      corpse, with the bodies of his son Abibas, his friend Nicodemus,
      and the illustrious Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian
      faith, were secretly buried in the adjacent field. He added, with
      some impatience, that it was time to release himself and his
      companions from their obscure prison; that their appearance would
      be salutary to a distressed world; and that they had made choice
      of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation
      and their wishes. The doubts and difficulties which still
      retarded this important discovery were successively removed by
      new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop, in the
      presence of an innumerable multitude. The coffins of Gamaliel, of
      his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when
      the fourth coffin, which contained the remains of Stephen, was
      shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odor, such as that
      of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various
      diseases of seventy-three of the assistants. The companions of
      Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala:
      but the relics of the first martyr were transported, in solemn
      procession, to a church constructed in their honor on Mount Sion;
      and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, 78 or
      the scrapings of a bone, were acknowledged, in almost every
      province of the Roman world, to possess a divine and miraculous
      virtue. The grave and learned Augustin, 79 whose understanding
      scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the
      innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa by the
      relics of St. Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted
      in the elaborate work of the City of God, which the bishop of
      Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of
      Christianity. Augustin solemnly declares, that he has selected
      those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons
      who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of
      the martyr. Many prodigies were omitted, or forgotten; and Hippo
      had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the
      province. And yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles,
      of which three were resurrections from the dead, in the space of
      two years, and within the limits of his own diocese. 80 If we
      enlarge our view to all the dioceses, and all the saints, of the
      Christian world, it will not be easy to calculate the fables, and
      the errors, which issued from this inexhaustible source. But we
      may surely be allowed to observe, that a miracle, in that age of
      superstition and credulity, lost its name and its merit, since it
      could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and
      established laws of nature.

      of fact and experience. Whatever might be the condition of vulgar
      souls, in the long interval between the dissolution and the
      resurrection of their bodies, it was evident that the superior
      spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of
      their existence in silent and inglorious sleep. 81 It was evident
      (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or
      the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and
      active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their
      powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their
      eternal reward. The enlargement of their intellectual faculties
      surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was
      proved by experience, that they were capable of hearing and
      understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries;
      who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of
      the world, invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of
      Martin. 82 The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the
      persuasion, that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye
      of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the
      prosperity of the Catholic Church; and that the individuals, who
      imitated the example of their faith and piety, were the peculiar
      and favorite objects of their most tender regard. Sometimes,
      indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of
      a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the
      places which had been consecrated by their birth, their
      residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their
      relics. The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may
      be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints
      themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of
      the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of
      punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who
      violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their
      supernatural power. 83 Atrocious, indeed, must have been the
      guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men,
      if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency,
      which the elements, the whole range of the animal creation, and
      even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind, were
      compelled to obey. 84 The immediate, and almost instantaneous,
      effects that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence,
      satisfied the Christians of the ample measure of favor and
      authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme
      God; and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they
      were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace;
      or whether they might not be permitted to exercise, according to
      the dictates of their benevolence and justice, the delegated
      powers of their subordinate ministry. The imagination, which had
      been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship
      of the Universal Cause, eagerly embraced such inferior objects of
      adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and
      imperfect faculties. The sublime and simple theology of the
      primitive Christians was gradually corrupted; and the Monarchy of
      heaven, already clouded by metaphysical subtleties, was degraded
      by the introduction of a popular mythology, which tended to
      restore the reign of polytheism. 85

      IV. As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the
      standard of the imagination, the rites and ceremonies were
      introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of
      the vulgar. If, in the beginning of the fifth century, 86
      Tertullian, or Lactantius, 87 had been suddenly raised from the
      dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint, or martyr,
      88 they would have gazed with astonishment, and indignation, on
      the profane spectacle, which had succeeded to the pure and
      spiritual worship of a Christian congregation. As soon as the
      doors of the church were thrown open, they must have been
      offended by the smoke of incense, the perfume of flowers, and the
      glare of lamps and tapers, which diffused, at noonday, a gaudy,
      superfluous, and, in their opinion, a sacrilegious light. If they
      approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way
      through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of
      strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of
      the feast; and who already felt the strong intoxication of
      fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine. Their devout kisses were
      imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice; and
      their fervent prayers were directed, whatever might be the
      language of their church, to the bones, the blood, or the ashes
      of the saint, which were usually concealed, by a linen or silken
      veil, from the eyes of the vulgar. The Christians frequented the
      tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their
      powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more
      especially of temporal, blessings. They implored the preservation
      of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the
      fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness
      of their children. Whenever they undertook any distant or
      dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be
      their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned
      without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to
      the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful
      thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of
      those heavenly patrons. The walls were hung round with symbols of
      the favors which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of
      gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long
      escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion,
      represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the
      tutelar saint. The same uniform original spirit of superstition
      might suggest, in the most distant ages and countries, the same
      methods of deceiving the credulity, and of affecting the senses
      of mankind: 89 but it must ingenuously be confessed, that the
      ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model,
      which they were impatient to destroy. The most respectable
      bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would
      more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism, if they
      found some resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of
      Christianity. The religion of Constantine achieved, in less than
      a century, the final conquest of the Roman empire: but the
      victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their
      vanquished rivals. 90 9011

      Chapter XXIX: Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of
      Theodosius.—Part I.

     Final Division Of The Roman Empire Between The Sons Of
     Theodosius.—Reign Of Arcadius And Honorius—Administration Of
     Rufinus And Stilicho.—Revolt And Defeat Of Gildo In Africa.

      The genius of Rome expired with Theodosius; the last of the
      successors of Augustus and Constantine, who appeared in the field
      at the head of their armies, and whose authority was universally
      acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. The
      memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the
      feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons. After the death
      of their father, Arcadius and Honorius were saluted, by the
      unanimous consent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the East,
      and of the West; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by
      every order of the state; the senates of old and new Rome, the
      clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people. Arcadius,
      who was then about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in
      the humble habitation of a private family. But he received a
      princely education in the palace of Constantinople; and his
      inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of
      royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of
      Thrace, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to
      the confines of Persia and Æthiopia. His younger brother
      Honorius, assumed, in the eleventh year of his age, the nominal
      government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the
      troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were opposed,
      on one side, to the Caledonians, and on the other, to the Moors.
      The great and martial præfecture of Illyricum was divided
      between the two princes: the defence and possession of the
      provinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia still belonged to
      the Western empire; but the two large dioceses of Dacia and
      Macedonia, which Gratian had intrusted to the valor of
      Theodosius, were forever united to the empire of the East. The
      boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now
      separates the Germans and the Turks; and the respective
      advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military
      strength, were fairly balanced and compensated, in this final and
      permanent division of the Roman empire. The hereditary sceptre of
      the sons of Theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of
      their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to
      adore the majesty of the royal infants; and the army and people
      were not admonished of their rights, and of their power, by the
      dangerous example of a recent election. The gradual discovery of
      the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius, and the repeated
      calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obliterate the
      deep and early impressions of loyalty. The subjects of Rome, who
      still reverenced the persons, or rather the names, of their
      sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who
      opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the
      throne.

      Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation
      of Rufinus; an odious favorite, who, in an age of civil and
      religious faction, has deserved, from every party, the imputation
      of every crime. The strong impulse of ambition and avarice 1 had
      urged Rufinus to abandon his native country, an obscure corner of
      Gaul, 2 to advance his fortune in the capital of the East: the
      talent of bold and ready elocution, 3 qualified him to succeed in
      the lucrative profession of the law; and his success in that
      profession was a regular step to the most honorable and important
      employments of the state. He was raised, by just degrees, to the
      station of master of the offices. In the exercise of his various
      functions, so essentially connected with the whole system of
      civil government, he acquired the confidence of a monarch, who
      soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business, and who
      long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice, and the
      covetousness of his disposition. These vices were concealed
      beneath the mask of profound dissimulation; 4 his passions were
      subservient only to the passions of his master; yet in the horrid
      massacre of Thessalonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury,
      without imitating the repentance, of Theodosius. The minister,
      who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind, never
      forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal enemies had
      forfeited, in his opinion, the merit of all public services.
      Promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the
      empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly
      supported the preeminence of a rival, whose character and
      profession he despised; and in the midst of a public council, the
      impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the
      indecent pride of the favorite. This act of violence was
      represented to the emperor as an insult, which it was incumbent
      on his dignity to resent. The disgrace and exile of Promotus were
      signified by a peremptory order, to repair, without delay, to a
      military station on the banks of the Danube; and the death of
      that general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the
      Barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus. 5 The
      sacrifice of a hero gratified his revenge; the honors of the
      consulship elated his vanity; but his power was still imperfect
      and precarious, as long as the important posts of præfect of the
      East, and of præfect of Constantinople, were filled by Tatian, 6
      and his son Proculus; whose united authority balanced, for some
      time, the ambition and favor of the master of the offices. The
      two præfects were accused of rapine and corruption in the
      administration of the laws and finances. For the trial of these
      illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special
      commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and
      reproach of injustice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was
      reserved to the president alone, and that president was Rufinus
      himself. The father, stripped of the præfecture of the East, was
      thrown into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few ministers
      can be found innocent, where an enemy is their judge, had
      secretly escaped; and Rufinus must have been satisfied with the
      least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not condescended to
      employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice. The prosecution
      was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation, which
      flattered Tatian with the hope of a favorable event: his
      confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances, and perfidious
      oaths, of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred
      name of Theodosius himself; and the unhappy father was at last
      persuaded to recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus.
      He was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in
      one of the suburbs of Constantinople, with a precipitation which
      disappointed the clemency of the emperor. Without respecting the
      misfortunes of a consular senator, the cruel judges of Tatian
      compelled him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord
      was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment when he
      expected. and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he
      was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in
      poverty and exile. 7 The punishment of the two præfects might,
      perhaps, be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own
      conduct; the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated by the jealous
      and unsociable nature of ambition. But he indulged a spirit of
      revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice, when he
      degraded their native country of Lycia from the rank of Roman
      provinces; stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of
      ignominy; and declared, that the countrymen of Tatian and
      Proculus should forever remain incapable of holding any
      employment of honor or advantage under the Imperial government. 8
      The new præfect of the East (for Rufinus instantly succeeded to
      the vacant honors of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by
      the most criminal pursuits, from the performance of the religious
      duties, which in that age were considered as the most essential
      to salvation. In the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, he
      had built a magnificent villa; to which he devoutly added a
      stately church, consecrated to the apostles St. Peter and St.
      Paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers and penance of a
      regular society of monks. A numerous, and almost general, synod
      of the bishops of the Eastern empire, was summoned to celebrate,
      at the same time, the dedication of the church, and the baptism
      of the founder. This double ceremony was performed with
      extraordinary pomp; and when Rufinus was purified, in the holy
      font, from all the sins that he had hitherto committed, a
      venerable hermit of Egypt rashly proposed himself as the sponsor
      of a proud and ambitious statesman. 9

      (Mem. Eccles. tom. ix. p. 593) records this synod, in which St.
      Gregory of Nyssa performed a conspicuous part.]

      The character of Theodosius imposed on his minister the task of
      hypocrisy, which disguised, and sometimes restrained, the abuse
      of power; and Rufinus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent
      slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and
      the virtue, which had raised him to the throne. 10 But the
      absence, and, soon afterwards, the death, of the emperor,
      confirmed the absolute authority of Rufinus over the person and
      dominions of Arcadius; a feeble youth, whom the imperious
      præfect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign.
      Regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions
      without remorse, and without resistance; and his malignant and
      rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have
      contributed to his own glory, or the happiness of the people. His
      avarice, 11 which seems to have prevailed, in his corrupt mind,
      over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the East, by
      the various arts of partial and general extortion; oppressive
      taxes, scandalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust
      confiscations, forced or fictitious testaments, by which the
      tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of
      strangers, or enemies; and the public sale of justice, as well as
      of favor, which he instituted in the palace of Constantinople.
      The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the expense of the
      fairest part of his patrimony, the honors and emoluments of some
      provincial government; the lives and fortunes of the unhappy
      people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser; and the
      public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an
      unpopular criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the
      præfect of the East, his accomplice and his judge. If avarice
      were not the blindest of the human passions, the motives of
      Rufinus might excite our curiosity; and we might be tempted to
      inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity
      and justice, to accumulate those immense treasures, which he
      could not spend without folly, nor possess without danger.
      Perhaps he vainly imagined, that he labored for the interest of
      an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil,
      and the august rank of Empress of the East. Perhaps he deceived
      himself by the opinion, that his avarice was the instrument of
      his ambition. He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and
      independent basis, which should no longer depend on the caprice
      of the young emperor; yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts
      of the soldiers and people, by the liberal distribution of those
      riches, which he had acquired with so much toil, and with so much
      guilt. The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the
      reproach and envy of ill-gotten wealth; his dependants served him
      without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed
      only by the influence of servile fear. The fate of Lucian
      proclaimed to the East, that the præfect, whose industry was
      much abated in the despatch of ordinary business, was active and
      indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge. Lucian, the son of the
      præfect Florentius, the oppressor of Gaul, and the enemy of
      Julian, had employed a considerable part of his inheritance, the
      fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the friendship of
      Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the East. But the new
      magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and
      of the times; disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a
      virtuous and temperate administration; and presumed to refuse an
      act of injustice, which might have tended to the profit of the
      emperor’s uncle. Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the
      supposed insult; and the præfect of the East resolved to execute
      in person the cruel vengeance, which he meditated against this
      ungrateful delegate of his power. He performed with incessant
      speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles, from
      Constantinople to Antioch, entered the capital of Syria at the
      dead of night, and spread universal consternation among a people
      ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his character. The
      Count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged, like the
      vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus.
      Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was
      not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, Lucian was
      condemned, almost with out a trial, to suffer a cruel and
      ignominious punishment. The ministers of the tyrant, by the
      orders, and in the presence, of their master, beat him on the
      neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead; and
      when he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in
      a close litter, to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the
      indignant city. No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman
      act, the sole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidst
      the deep and silent curses of a trembling people, from Antioch to
      Constantinople; and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of
      accomplishing, without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with
      the emperor of the East. 12

      statute always proves the existence of tyranny; but a laudable

      This allusion of Claudian (in Rufin. i. 241) is again explained
      by the circumstantial narrative of Zosimus, (l. v. p. 288, 289.)]

      But Rufinus soon experienced, that a prudent minister should
      constantly secure his royal captive by the strong, though
      invisible chain of habit; and that the merit, and much more
      easily the favor, of the absent, are obliterated in a short time
      from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign. While the
      præfect satiated his revenge at Antioch, a secret conspiracy of
      the favorite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain
      Eutropius, undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople.
      They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the
      daughter of Rufinus, who had been chosen, without his consent,
      for his bride; and they contrived to substitute in her place the
      fair Eudoxia, the daughter of Bauto, 13 a general of the Franks
      in the service of Rome; and who was educated, since the death of
      her father, in the family of the sons of Promotus. The young
      emperor, whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious
      care of his tutor Arsenius, 14 eagerly listened to the artful and
      flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia: he gazed with
      impatient ardor on her picture, and he understood the necessity
      of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a
      minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation
      of his happiness. Soon after the return of Rufinus, the
      approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the
      people of Constantinople, who prepared to celebrate, with false
      and hollow acclamations, the fortune of his daughter. A splendid
      train of eunuchs and officers issued, in hymeneal pomp, from the
      gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the
      inestimable ornaments, of the future empress. The solemn
      procession passed through the streets of the city, which were
      adorned with garlands, and filled with spectators; but when it
      reached the house of the sons of Promotus, the principal eunuch
      respectfully entered the mansion, invested the fair Eudoxia with
      the Imperial robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace
      and bed of Arcadius. 15 The secrecy and success with which this
      conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted, imprinted a mark
      of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister, who had
      suffered himself to be deceived, in a post where the arts of
      deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit.
      He considered, with a mixture of indignation and fear, the
      victory of an aspiring eunuch, who had secretly captivated the
      favor of his sovereign; and the disgrace of his daughter, whose
      interest was inseparably connected with his own, wounded the
      tenderness, or, at least, the pride of Rufinus. At the moment
      when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a
      line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house
      of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the Imperial bed;
      and Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit, to
      improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind
      of a fond and youthful husband. The emperor would soon be
      instructed to hate, to fear, and to destroy the powerful subject,
      whom he had injured; and the consciousness of guilt deprived
      Rufinus of every hope, either of safety or comfort, in the
      retirement of a private life. But he still possessed the most
      effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of
      oppressing his enemies. The præfect still exercised an
      uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of
      the East; and his treasures, if he could resolve to use them,
      might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution
      of the blackest designs, that pride, ambition, and revenge could
      suggest to a desperate statesman. The character of Rufinus seemed
      to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person
      of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant throne; and that
      he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to invade the
      provinces of the empire, and to increase the public confusion.
      The subtle præfect, whose life had been spent in the intrigues
      of the palace, opposed, with equal arms, the artful measures of
      the eunuch Eutropius; but the timid soul of Rufinus was
      astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival, of
      the great Stilicho, the general, or rather the master, of the
      empire of the West. 16

      paints, in lively colors, the distress and guilt of the
      præfect.]

      The celestial gift, which Achilles obtained, and Alexander
      envied, of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has
      been enjoyed by Stilicho, in a much higher degree than might have
      been expected from the declining state of genius, and of art. The
      muse of Claudian, 17 devoted to his service, was always prepared
      to stigmatize his adversaries, Rufinus, or Eutropius, with
      eternal infamy; or to paint, in the most splendid colors, the
      victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor. In the review of
      a period indifferently supplied with authentic materials, we
      cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius, from the
      invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporary writer; but as
      Claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a
      poet and a courtier, some criticism will be requisite to
      translate the language of fiction or exaggeration, into the truth
      and simplicity of historic prose. His silence concerning the
      family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof, that his patron
      was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of a long series of
      illustrious progenitors; and the slight mention of his father, an
      officer of Barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens, seems to
      countenance the assertion, that the general, who so long
      commanded the armies of Rome, was descended from the savage and
      perfidious race of the Vandals. 18 If Stilicho had not possessed
      the external advantages of strength and stature, the most
      flattering bard, in the presence of so many thousand spectators,
      would have hesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measure of
      the demi-gods of antiquity; and that whenever he moved, with
      lofty steps, through the streets of the capital, the astonished
      crowd made room for the stranger, who displayed, in a private
      condition, the awful majesty of a hero. From his earliest youth
      he embraced the profession of arms; his prudence and valor were
      soon distinguished in the field; the horsemen and archers of the
      East admired his superior dexterity; and in each degree of his
      military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and
      approved the choice of the sovereign. He was named, by
      Theodosius, to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia;
      he supported, during that important embassy, the dignity of the
      Roman name; and after he returned to Constantinople, his merit
      was rewarded by an intimate and honorable alliance with the
      Imperial family. Theodosius had been prompted, by a pious motive
      of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter of
      his brother Honorius; the beauty and accomplishments of Serena 19
      were universally admired by the obsequious court; and Stilicho
      obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals, who ambitiously
      disputed the hand of the princess, and the favor of her adopted
      father. 20 The assurance that the husband of Serena would be
      faithful to the throne, which he was permitted to approach,
      engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes, and to employ the
      abilities, of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho. He rose,
      through the successive steps of master of the horse, and count of
      the domestics, to the supreme rank of master-general of all the
      cavalry and infantry of the Roman, or at least of the Western,
      empire; 21 and his enemies confessed, that he invariably
      disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit, or to defraud
      the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or
      claimed, from the liberality of the state. 22 The valor and
      conduct which he afterwards displayed, in the defence of Italy,
      against the arms of Alaric and Radagaisus, may justify the fame
      of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the
      laws of honor, or of pride, the Roman generals might yield the
      preeminence of rank, to the ascendant of superior genius. 23 He
      lamented, and revenged, the murder of Promotus, his rival and his
      friend; and the massacre of many thousands of the flying
      Bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice, which
      the Roman Achilles offered to the manes of another Patroclus. The
      virtues and victories of Stilicho deserved the hatred of Rufinus:
      and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender
      and vigilant Serena had not protected her husband against his
      domestic foes, whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of
      the empire. 24 Theodosius continued to support an unworthy
      minister, to whose diligence he delegated the government of the
      palace, and of the East; but when he marched against the tyrant
      Eugenius, he associated his faithful general to the labors and
      glories of the civil war; and in the last moments of his life,
      the dying monarch recommended to Stilicho the care of his sons,
      and of the republic. 25 The ambition and the abilities of
      Stilicho were not unequal to the important trust; and he claimed
      the guardianship of the two empires, during the minority of
      Arcadius and Honorius. 26 The first measure of his
      administration, or rather of his reign, displayed to the nations
      the vigor and activity of a spirit worthy to command. He passed
      the Alps in the depth of winter; descended the stream of the
      Rhine, from the fortress of Basil to the marshes of Batavia;
      reviewed the state of the garrisons; repressed the enterprises of
      the Germans; and, after establishing along the banks a firm and
      honorable peace, returned, with incredible speed, to the palace
      of Milan. 27 The person and court of Honorius were subject to the
      master-general of the West; and the armies and provinces of
      Europe obeyed, without hesitation, a regular authority, which was
      exercised in the name of their young sovereign. Two rivals only
      remained to dispute the claims, and to provoke the vengeance, of
      Stilicho. Within the limits of Africa, Gildo, the Moor,
      maintained a proud and dangerous independence; and the minister
      of Constantinople asserted his equal reign over the emperor, and
      the empire, of the East.

      Chapter XXIX: Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of
      Theodosius.—Part II.

      The impartiality which Stilicho affected, as the common guardian
      of the royal brothers, engaged him to regulate the equal division
      of the arms, the jewels, and the magnificent wardrobe and
      furniture of the deceased emperor. 28 But the most important
      object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions,
      cohorts, and squadrons, of Romans, or Barbarians, whom the event
      of the civil war had united under the standard of Theodosius. The
      various multitudes of Europe and Asia, exasperated by recent
      animosities, were overawed by the authority of a single man; and
      the rigid discipline of Stilicho protected the lands of the
      citizens from the rapine of the licentious soldier. 29 Anxious,
      however, and impatient, to relieve Italy from the presence of
      this formidable host, which could be useful only on the frontiers
      of the empire, he listened to the just requisition of the
      minister of Arcadius, declared his intention of reconducting in
      person the troops of the East, and dexterously employed the rumor
      of a Gothic tumult to conceal his private designs of ambition and
      revenge. 30 The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the
      approach of a warrior and a rival, whose enmity he deserved; he
      computed, with increasing terror, the narrow space of his life
      and greatness; and, as the last hope of safety, he interposed the
      authority of the emperor Arcadius. Stilicho, who appears to have
      directed his march along the sea-coast of the Adriatic, was not
      far distant from the city of Thessalonica, when he received a
      peremptory message, to recall the troops of the East, and to
      declare, that his nearer approach would be considered, by the
      Byzantine court, as an act of hostility. The prompt and
      unexpected obedience of the general of the West, convinced the
      vulgar of his loyalty and moderation; and, as he had already
      engaged the affection of the Eastern troops, he recommended to
      their zeal the execution of his bloody design, which might be
      accomplished in his absence, with less danger, perhaps, and with
      less reproach. Stilicho left the command of the troops of the
      East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he firmly relied,
      with an assurance, at least, that the hardy Barbarians would
      never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear
      or remorse. The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the
      enemy of Stilicho and of Rome; and such was the general hatred
      which Rufinus had excited, that the fatal secret, communicated to
      thousands, was faithfully preserved during the long march from
      Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople. As soon as they had
      resolved his death, they condescended to flatter his pride; the
      ambitious præfect was seduced to believe, that those powerful
      auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and
      the treasures which he distributed, with a tardy and reluctant
      hand, were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult,
      rather than as a gift. At the distance of a mile from the
      capital, in the field of Mars, before the palace of Hebdomon, the
      troops halted: and the emperor, as well as his minister,
      advanced, according to ancient custom, respectfully to salute the
      power which supported their throne. As Rufinus passed along the
      ranks, and disguised, with studied courtesy, his innate
      haughtiness, the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and
      left, and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their
      arms. Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation,
      Gainas gave the signal of death; a daring and forward soldier
      plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty præfect, and
      Rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted
      emperor. If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a
      whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse
      could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be
      affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder
      of Rufinus. His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of
      the populace of either sex, who hastened in crowds, from every
      quarter of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty
      minister, at whose frown they had so lately trembled. His right
      hand was cut off, and carried through the streets of
      Constantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the
      avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly exposed, borne aloft
      on the point of a long lance. 31 According to the savage maxims
      of the Greek republics, his innocent family would have shared the
      punishment of his crimes. The wife and daughter of Rufinus were
      indebted for their safety to the influence of religion. Her

      The servile poet of Stilicho applauds, with ferocious joy, this
      horrid deed, which, in the execution, perhaps, of justice,
      violated every law of nature and society, profaned the majesty of
      the prince, and renewed the dangerous examples of military
      license. The contemplation of the universal order and harmony had
      satisfied Claudian of the existence of the Deity; but the
      prosperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict his moral
      attributes; and the fate of Rufinus was the only event which
      could dispel the religious doubts of the poet. 33 Such an act
      might vindicate the honor of Providence, but it did not much
      contribute to the happiness of the people. In less than three
      months they were informed of the maxims of the new
      administration, by a singular edict, which established the
      exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of Rufinus; and
      silenced, under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of the
      subjects of the Eastern empire, who had been injured by his
      rapacious tyranny. 34 Even Stilicho did not derive from the
      murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed; and though
      he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed. Under
      the name of a favorite, the weakness of Arcadius required a
      master, but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the
      eunuch Eutropius, who had obtained his domestic confidence: and
      the emperor contemplated, with terror and aversion, the stern
      genius of a foreign warrior. Till they were divided by the
      jealousy of power, the sword of Gainas, and the charms of
      Eudoxia, supported the favor of the great chamberlain of the
      palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed master-general of
      the East, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his
      benefactor; and the same troops, who had so lately massacred the
      enemy of Stilicho, were engaged to support, against him, the
      independence of the throne of Constantinople. The favorites of
      Arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcilable war against a
      formidable hero, who aspired to govern, and to defend, the two
      empires of Rome, and the two sons of Theodosius. They incessantly
      labored, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of
      the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the
      friendship of the Barbarians. The life of Stilicho was repeatedly
      attempted by the dagger of hired assassins; and a decree was
      obtained from the senate of Constantinople, to declare him an
      enemy of the republic, and to confiscate his ample possessions in
      the provinces of the East. At a time when the only hope of
      delaying the ruin of the Roman name depended on the firm union,
      and reciprocal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been
      gradually communicated, the subjects of Arcadius and Honorius
      were instructed, by their respective masters, to view each other
      in a foreign, and even hostile, light; to rejoice in their mutual
      calamities, and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the
      Barbarians, whom they excited to invade the territories of their
      countrymen. 35 The natives of Italy affected to despise the
      servile and effeminate Greeks of Byzantium, who presumed to
      imitate the dress, and to usurp the dignity, of Roman senators;
      36 and the Greeks had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and
      contempt, which their polished ancestors had so long entertained
      for the rude inhabitants of the West. The distinction of two
      governments, which soon produced the separation of two nations,
      will justify my design of suspending the series of the Byzantine
      history, to prosecute, without interruption, the disgraceful, but
      memorable, reign of Honorius.

      It is curious to observe the first symptoms of jealousy and
      schism between old and new Rome, between the Greeks and Latins.]

      The prudent Stilicho, instead of persisting to force the
      inclinations of a prince, and people, who rejected his
      government, wisely abandoned Arcadius to his unworthy favorites;
      and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war
      displayed the moderation of a minister, who had so often
      signalized his military spirit and abilities. But if Stilicho had
      any longer endured the revolt of Africa, he would have betrayed
      the security of the capital, and the majesty of the Western
      emperor, to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel. Gildo,
      37 the brother of the tyrant Firmus, had preserved and obtained,
      as the reward of his apparent fidelity, the immense patrimony
      which was forfeited by treason: long and meritorious service, in
      the armies of Rome, raised him to the dignity of a military
      count; the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted
      the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the
      interest of a powerful family; and the brother of Firmus was
      invested with the command of Africa. His ambition soon usurped
      the administration of justice, and of the finances, without
      account, and without control; and he maintained, during a reign
      of twelve years, the possession of an office, from which it was
      impossible to remove him, without the danger of a civil war.
      During those twelve years, the provinces of Africa groaned under
      the dominion of a tyrant, who seemed to unite the unfeeling
      temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic
      faction. The forms of law were often superseded by the use of
      poison; and if the trembling guests, who were invited to the
      table of Gildo, presumed to express fears, the insolent suspicion
      served only to excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the
      ministers of death. Gildo alternately indulged the passions of
      avarice and lust; 38 and if his days were terrible to the rich,
      his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents. The
      fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the
      embraces of the tyrant; and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious
      troop of Barbarians and assassins, the black, or swarthy, natives
      of the desert; whom Gildo considered as the only guardians of his
      throne. In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius, the
      count, or rather the sovereign, of Africa, maintained a haughty
      and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either of the
      contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the
      declaration of fortune, and reserved for the conqueror the vain
      professions of his allegiance. Such professions would not have
      satisfied the master of the Roman world; but the death of
      Theodosius, and the weakness and discord of his sons, confirmed
      the power of the Moor; who condescended, as a proof of his
      moderation, to abstain from the use of the diadem, and to supply
      Rome with the customary tribute, or rather subsidy, of corn. In
      every division of the empire, the five provinces of Africa were
      invariably assigned to the West; and Gildo had to govern that
      extensive country in the name of Honorius, but his knowledge of
      the character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address
      his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign. The ministers
      of Arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the
      delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the
      empire of the East, tempted them to assert a claim, which they
      were incapable of supporting, either by reason or by arms. 39

      Claudian (de Bell. Gildonico, 230-324) has touched, with
      political delicacy, the intrigues of the Byzantine court, which
      are likewise mentioned by Zosimus, (l. v. p. 302.)]

      When Stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer to the
      pretensions of the Byzantine court, he solemnly accused the
      tyrant of Africa before the tribunal, which had formerly judged
      the kings and nations of the earth; and the image of the republic
      was revived, after a long interval, under the reign of Honorius.
      The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample detail of the
      complaints of the provincials, and the crimes of Gildo, to the
      Roman senate; and the members of that venerable assembly were
      required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel. Their
      unanimous suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic; and
      the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction
      to the Roman arms. 40 A people, who still remembered that their
      ancestors had been the masters of the world, would have
      applauded, with conscious pride, the representation of ancient
      freedom; if they had not since been accustomed to prefer the
      solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty
      and greatness. The subsistence of Rome depended on the harvests
      of Africa; and it was evident, that a declaration of war would be
      the signal of famine. The præfect Symmachus, who presided in the
      deliberations of the senate, admonished the minister of his just
      apprehension, that as soon as the revengeful Moor should prohibit
      the exportation of corn, tranquility and perhaps the safety, of
      the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent
      multitude. 41 The prudence of Stilicho conceived and executed,
      without delay, the most effectual measure for the relief of the
      Roman people. A large and seasonable supply of corn, collected in
      the inland provinces of Gaul, was embarked on the rapid stream of
      the Rhone, and transported, by an easy navigation, from the Rhone
      to the Tyber. During the whole term of the African war, the
      granaries of Rome were continually filled, her dignity was
      vindicated from the humiliating dependence, and the minds of an
      immense people were quieted by the calm confidence of peace and
      plenty. 42

      The cause of Rome, and the conduct of the African war, were
      intrusted by Stilicho to a general, active and ardent to avenge
      his private injuries on the head of the tyrant. The spirit of
      discord which prevailed in the house of Nabal, had excited a
      deadly quarrel between two of his sons, Gildo and Mascezel. 43
      The usurper pursued, with implacable rage, the life of his
      younger brother, whose courage and abilities he feared; and
      Mascezel, oppressed by superior power, took refuge in the court
      of Milan, where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his
      two innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their
      inhuman uncle. The affliction of the father was suspended only by
      the desire of revenge. The vigilant Stilicho already prepared to
      collect the naval and military force of the Western empire; and
      he had resolved, if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal
      and doubtful war, to march against him in person. But as Italy
      required his presence, and as it might be dangerous to weaken the
      defence of the frontier, he judged it more advisable, that
      Mascezel should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a
      chosen body of Gallic veterans, who had lately served under the
      standard of Eugenius. These troops, who were exhorted to convince
      the world that they could subvert, as well as defend the throne
      of a usurper, consisted of the Jovian, the Herculian, and the
      Augustan legions; of the Nervian auxiliaries; of the soldiers who
      displayed in their banners the symbol of a lion, and of the
      troops which were distinguished by the auspicious names of
      Fortunate, and Invincible. Yet such was the smallness of their
      establishments, or the difficulty of recruiting, that these seven
      bands, 44 of high dignity and reputation in the service of Rome,
      amounted to no more than five thousand effective men. 45 The
      fleet of galleys and transports sailed in tempestuous weather
      from the port of Pisa, in Tuscany, and steered their course to
      the little island of Capraria; which had borrowed that name from
      the wild goats, its original inhabitants, whose place was
      occupied by a new colony of a strange and savage appearance. “The
      whole island (says an ingenious traveller of those times) is
      filled, or rather defiled, by men who fly from the light. They
      call themselves Monks, or solitaries, because they choose to live
      alone, without any witnesses of their actions. They fear the
      gifts of fortune, from the apprehension of losing them; and, lest
      they should be miserable, they embrace a life of voluntary
      wretchedness. How absurd is their choice! how perverse their
      understanding! to dread the evils, without being able to support
      the blessings, of the human condition. Either this melancholy
      madness is the effect of disease, or exercise on their own bodies
      the tortures which are inflicted on fugitive slaves by the hand
      of justice.” 46 Such was the contempt of a profane magistrate for
      the monks as the chosen servants of God. 47 Some of them were
      persuaded, by his entreaties, to embark on board the fleet; and
      it is observed, to the praise of the Roman general, that his days
      and nights were employed in prayer, fasting, and the occupation
      of singing psalms. The devout leader, who, with such a
      reenforcement, appeared confident of victory, avoided the
      dangerous rocks of Corsica, coasted along the eastern side of
      Sardinia, and secured his ships against the violence of the south
      wind, by casting anchor in the and capacious harbor of Cagliari,
      at the distance of one hundred and forty miles from the African
      shores. 48

      Gildo was prepared to resist the invasion with all the forces of
      Africa. By the liberality of his gifts and promises, he
      endeavored to secure the doubtful allegiance of the Roman
      soldiers, whilst he attracted to his standard the distant tribes
      of Gaetulia and Æthiopia. He proudly reviewed an army of seventy
      thousand men, and boasted, with the rash presumption which is the
      forerunner of disgrace, that his numerous cavalry would trample
      under their horses’ feet the troops of Mascezel, and involve, in
      a cloud of burning sand, the natives of the cold regions of Gaul
      and Germany. 49 But the Moor, who commanded the legions of
      Honorius, was too well acquainted with the manners of his
      countrymen, to entertain any serious apprehension of a naked and
      disorderly host of Barbarians; whose left arm, instead of a
      shield, was protected only by mantle; who were totally disarmed
      as soon as they had darted their javelin from their right hand;
      and whose horses had never been in combat. He fixed his camp of
      five thousand veterans in the face of a superior enemy, and,
      after the delay of three days, gave the signal of a general
      engagement. 50 As Mascezel advanced before the front with fair
      offers of peace and pardon, he encountered one of the foremost
      standard-bearers of the Africans, and, on his refusal to yield,
      struck him on the arm with his sword. The arm, and the standard,
      sunk under the weight of the blow; and the imaginary act of
      submission was hastily repeated by all the standards of the line.
      At this the disaffected cohorts proclaimed the name of their
      lawful sovereign; the Barbarians, astonished by the defection of
      their Roman allies, dispersed, according to their custom, in
      tumultuary flight; and Mascezel obtained honors the of an easy,
      and almost bloodless, victory. 51 The tyrant escaped from the
      field of battle to the sea-shore; and threw himself into a small
      vessel, with the hope of reaching in safety some friendly port of
      the empire of the East; but the obstinacy of the wind drove him
      back into the harbor of Tabraca, 52 which had acknowledged, with
      the rest of the province, the dominion of Honorius, and the
      authority of his lieutenant. The inhabitants, as a proof of their
      repentance and loyalty, seized and confined the person of Gildo
      in a dungeon; and his own despair saved him from the intolerable
      torture of supporting the presence of an injured and victorious
      brother. 53 The captives and the spoils of Africa were laid at
      the feet of the emperor; but Stilicho, whose moderation appeared
      more conspicuous and more sincere, in the midst of prosperity,
      still affected to consult the laws of the republic; and referred
      to the senate and people of Rome the judgment of the most
      illustrious criminals. 54 Their trial was public and solemn; but
      the judges, in the exercise of this obsolete and precarious
      jurisdiction, were impatient to punish the African magistrates,
      who had intercepted the subsistence of the Roman people. The rich
      and guilty province was oppressed by the Imperial ministers, who
      had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices
      of Gildo; and if an edict of Honorius seems to check the
      malicious industry of informers, a subsequent edict, at the
      distance of ten years, continues and renews the prosecution of
      the offences which had been committed in the time of the general
      rebellion. 55 The adherents of the tyrant who escaped the first
      fury of the soldiers, and the judges, might derive some
      consolation from the tragic fate of his brother, who could never
      obtain his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had
      performed. After he had finished an important war in the space of
      a single winter, Mascezel was received at the court of Milan with
      loud applause, affected gratitude, and secret jealousy; 56 and
      his death, which, perhaps, was the effect of passage of a bridge,
      the Moorish prince, who accompanied the master-general of the
      West, was suddenly thrown from his horse into the river; the
      officious haste of the attendants was restrained by a cruel and
      perfidious smile which they observed on the countenance of

      that he introduces the famous sentence, so familiar to the
      friends of despotism:

    —-Nunquam libertas gratior exstat, Quam sub rege pio.

      right of sanctuary.]

      The joy of the African triumph was happily connected with the
      nuptials of the emperor Honorius, and of his cousin Maria, the
      daughter of Stilicho: and this equal and honorable alliance
      seemed to invest the powerful minister with the authority of a
      parent over his submissive pupil. The muse of Claudian was not
      silent on this propitious day; 58 he sung, in various and lively
      strains, the happiness of the royal pair; and the glory of the
      hero, who confirmed their union, and supported their throne. The
      ancient fables of Greece, which had almost ceased to be the
      object of religious faith, were saved from oblivion by the genius
      of poetry. The picture of the Cyprian grove, the seat of harmony
      and love; the triumphant progress of Venus over her native seas,
      and the mild influence which her presence diffused in the palace
      of Milan, express to every age the natural sentiments of the
      heart, in the just and pleasing language of allegorical fiction.
      But the amorous impatience which Claudian attributes to the young
      prince, 59 must excite the smiles of the court; and his beauteous
      spouse (if she deserved the praise of beauty) had not much to
      fear or to hope from the passions of her lover. Honorius was only
      in the fourteenth year of his age; Serena, the mother of his
      bride, deferred, by art of persuasion, the consummation of the
      royal nuptials; Maria died a virgin, after she had been ten years
      a wife; and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the
      coldness, or perhaps, the debility, of his constitution. 60 His
      subjects, who attentively studied the character of their young
      sovereign, discovered that Honorius was without passions, and
      consequently without talents; and that his feeble and languid
      disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his
      rank, or of enjoying the pleasures of his age. In his early youth
      he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the
      bow: but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations, and
      the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily
      care of the monarch of the West, 61 who resigned the reins of
      empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho. The
      experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a
      prince who was born in the purple, received a worse education
      than the meanest peasant of his dominions; and that the ambitious
      minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood, without
      attempting to excite his courage, or to enlighten his
      understanding. 62 The predecessors of Honorius were accustomed to
      animate by their example, or at least by their presence, the
      valor of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the
      perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the
      Roman world. But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his
      life, a captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the
      patient, almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the
      Western empire, which was repeatedly attacked, and finally
      subverted, by the arms of the Barbarians. In the eventful history
      of a reign of twenty-eight years, it will seldom be necessary to
      mention the name of the emperor Honorius.

      If the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to
      the great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully
      the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported
      the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic. He died in the
      month of January; and before the end of the winter of the same
      year, the Gothic nation was in arms. 1 The Barbarian auxiliaries
      erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile
      designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds.
      Their countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of
      the last treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted
      their farms at the first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly
      resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down. The
      barriers of the Danube were thrown open; the savage warriors of
      Scythia issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of
      the winter allowed the poet to remark, “that they rolled their
      ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the indignant
      river.” 2 The unhappy natives of the provinces to the south of
      the Danube submitted to the calamities, which, in the course of
      twenty years, were almost grown familiar to their imagination;
      and the various troops of Barbarians, who gloried in the Gothic
      name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of Dalmatia, to
      the walls of Constantinople. 3 The interruption, or at least the
      diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the
      prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of
      their revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for
      the unwarlike sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was
      inflamed by the weakness, or treachery, of the minister of
      Arcadius. The frequent visits of Rufinus to the camp of the
      Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were
      considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence,
      and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of
      policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare
      the private estates of the unpopular præfect. The Goths, instead
      of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their
      chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of
      Alaric. That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of
      the Balti; 4 which yielded only to the royal dignity of the
      Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies; and the
      Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their
      refusal, and the importance of their loss. Whatever hopes might
      be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious
      general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst
      of a divided court and a discontented people, the emperor
      Arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the Gothic arms; but the
      want of wisdom and valor was supplied by the strength of the
      city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might
      securely brave the impotent and random darts of the Barbarians.
      Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and
      ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a
      plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had
      hitherto escaped the ravages of war. 5

      ad Hist. Gothic. p. 53.) The lords of Baux, near Arles, and of
      seventy-nine subordinate places, were independent of the counts
      of Provence, (Longuerue, Description de la France, tom. i. p.
      357).]

      conquest of Greece: but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so
      many rays of historic light.]

      The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus
      had devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public
      suspicion, that he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and
      learning to the Gothic invader. The proconsul Antiochus was the
      unworthy son of a respectable father; and Gerontius, who
      commanded the provincial troops, was much better qualified to
      execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to defend, with
      courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by the
      hand of nature. Alaric had traversed, without resistance, the
      plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount
      Oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his
      cavalry. They stretched from east to west, to the edge of the
      sea-shore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf,
      an interval of three hundred feet, which, in some places, was
      contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage.
      6 In this narrow pass of Thermopylae, where Leonidas and the
      three hundred Spartans had gloriously devoted their lives, the
      Goths might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful
      general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have
      kindled some sparks of military ardor in the breasts of the
      degenerate Greeks. The troops which had been posted to defend the
      Straits of Thermopylae, retired, as they were directed, without
      attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric; 7
      and the fertile fields of Phocis and Boeotia were instantly
      covered by a deluge of Barbarians who massacred the males of an
      age to bear arms, and drove away the beautiful females, with the
      spoil and cattle of the flaming villages. The travellers, who
      visited Greece several years afterwards, could easily discover
      the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and Thebes
      was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her
      seven gates, than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to
      occupy the city of Athens, and the important harbor of the
      Piraeus. The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and
      danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as
      the Athenians heard the voice of the Gothic herald, they were
      easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as
      the ransom of the city of Minerva and its inhabitants. The treaty
      was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mutual fidelity.
      The Gothic prince, with a small and select train, was admitted
      within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the
      bath, accepted a splendid banquet, which was provided by the
      magistrate, and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the
      manners of civilized nations. 8 But the whole territory of
      Attica, from the promontory of Sunium to the town of Megara, was
      blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the
      comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled
      the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. The distance
      between Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles;
      but the bad road, an expressive name, which it still bears among
      the Greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for
      the march of an enemy. The thick and gloomy woods of Mount
      Cithaeron covered the inland country; the Scironian rocks
      approached the water’s edge, and hung over the narrow and winding
      path, which was confined above six miles along the sea-shore. 9
      The passage of those rocks, so infamous in every age, was
      terminated by the Isthmus of Corinth; and a small a body of firm
      and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a
      temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from the Ionian to
      the Aegean Sea. The confidence of the cities of Peloponnesus in
      their natural rampart, had tempted them to neglect the care of
      their antique walls; and the avarice of the Roman governors had
      exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province. 10 Corinth, Argos,
      Sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths; and
      the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from
      beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of
      their cities. 11 The vases and statues were distributed among the
      Barbarians, with more regard to the value of the materials, than
      to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives submitted
      to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of
      valor; and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse
      which was justified by the example of the heroic times. 12 The
      descendants of that extraordinary people, who had considered
      valor and discipline as the walls of Sparta, no longer remembered
      the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more
      formidable than Alaric. “If thou art a god, thou wilt not hurt
      those who have never injured thee; if thou art a man,
      advance:—and thou wilt find men equal to thyself.” 13 From
      Thermopylae to Sparta, the leader of the Goths pursued his
      victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists: but
      one of the advocates of expiring Paganism has confidently
      asserted, that the walls of Athens were guarded by the goddess
      Minerva, with her formidable Aegis, and by the angry phantom of
      Achilles; 14 and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence
      of the hostile deities of Greece. In an age of miracles, it would
      perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian Zosimus
      to the common benefit: yet it cannot be dissembled, that the mind
      of Alaric was ill prepared to receive, either in sleeping or
      waking visions, the impressions of Greek superstition. The songs
      of Homer, and the fame of Achilles, had probably never reached
      the ear of the illiterate Barbarian; and the Christian faith,
      which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the
      imaginary deities of Rome and Athens. The invasion of the Goths,
      instead of vindicating the honor, contributed, at least
      accidentally, to extirpate the last remains of Paganism: and the
      mysteries of Ceres, which had subsisted eighteen hundred years,
      did not survive the destruction of Eleusis, and the calamities of
      Greece. 15

      The last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their
      arms, their gods, or their sovereign, was placed in the powerful
      assistance of the general of the West; and Stilicho, who had not
      been permitted to repulse, advanced to chastise, the invaders of
      Greece. 16 A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy;
      and the troops, after a short and prosperous navigation over the
      Ionian Sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the
      ruins of Corinth. The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia,
      the fabulous residence of Pan and the Dryads, became the scene of
      a long and doubtful conflict between the two generals not
      unworthy of each other. The skill and perseverance of the Roman
      at length prevailed; and the Goths, after sustaining a
      considerable loss from disease and desertion, gradually retreated
      to the lofty mountain of Pholoe, near the sources of the Peneus,
      and on the frontiers of Elis; a sacred country, which had
      formerly been exempted from the calamities of war. 17 The camp of
      the Barbarians was immediately besieged; the waters of the river
      18 were diverted into another channel; and while they labored
      under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger, a strong
      line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape. After
      these precautions, Stilicho, too confident of victory, retired to
      enjoy his triumph, in the theatrical games, and lascivious
      dances, of the Greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards,
      spread themselves over the country of their allies, which they
      stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of
      the enemy. Alaric appears to have seized the favorable moment to
      execute one of those hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of
      a general are displayed with more genuine lustre, than in the
      tumult of a day of battle. To extricate himself from the prison
      of Peloponnesus, it was necessary that he should pierce the
      intrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a
      difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far as the Gulf
      of Corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his
      captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the
      narrow interval between Rhium and the opposite shore, is at least
      half a mile in breadth. 19 The operations of Alaric must have
      been secret, prudent, and rapid; since the Roman general was
      confounded by the intelligence, that the Goths, who had eluded
      his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of
      Epirus. This unfortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to
      conclude the treaty, which he secretly negotiated, with the

      compelled Stilicho to retire, at the haughty mandate of his
      rivals, from the dominions of Arcadius; and he respected, in the
      enemy of Rome, the honorable character of the ally and servant of
      the emperor of the East.

      A Grecian philosopher, 20 who visited Constantinople soon after
      the death of Theodosius, published his liberal opinions
      concerning the duties of kings, and the state of the Roman
      republic. Synesius observes, and deplores, the fatal abuse, which
      the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the
      military service. The citizens and subjects had purchased an
      exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country;
      which was supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The
      fugitives of Scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious
      dignities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the
      salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the
      riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of
      their contempt and hatred; and the power of the Goths was the
      stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace and
      safety of the devoted state. The measures which Synesius
      recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. He
      exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects, by the
      example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court and from
      the camp; to substitute, in the place of the Barbarian
      mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the defence of their
      laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment of public
      danger, the mechanic from his shop, and the philosopher from his
      school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure,
      and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the
      laborious husbandman. At the head of such troops, who might
      deserve the name, and would display the spirit, of Romans, he
      animates the son of Theodosius to encounter a race of Barbarians,
      who were destitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his
      arms, till he had chased them far away into the solitudes of
      Scythia; or had reduced them to the state of ignominious
      servitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the
      captive Helots. 21 The court of Arcadius indulged the zeal,
      applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice, of Synesius.
      Perhaps the philosopher who addresses the emperor of the East in
      the language of reason and virtue, which he might have used to a
      Spartan king, had not condescended to form a practicable scheme,
      consistent with the temper, and circumstances, of a degenerate
      age. Perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was
      seldom interrupted by reflection, might reject, as wild and
      visionary, every proposal, which exceeded the measure of their
      capacity, and deviated from the forms and precedents of office.
      While the oration of Synesius, and the downfall of the
      Barbarians, were the topics of popular conversation, an edict was
      published at Constantinople, which declared the promotion of
      Alaric to the rank of master-general of the Eastern Illyricum.
      The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the
      faith of treaties, were justly indignant, that the ruin of Greece
      and Epirus should be so liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror
      was received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had
      so lately besieged. The fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the
      husbands, whose wives he had violated, were subject to his
      authority; and the success of his rebellion encouraged the
      ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries. The use to
      which Alaric applied his new command, distinguishes the firm and
      judicious character of his policy. He issued his orders to the
      four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms,
      Margus, Ratiaria, Naissus, and Thessalonica, to provide his
      troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords,
      and spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the
      instruments of their own destruction; and the Barbarians removed
      the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of
      their courage. 22 The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past
      exploits, and the confidence in his future designs, insensibly
      united the body of the nation under his victorious standard; and,
      with the unanimous consent of the Barbarian chieftains, the
      master-general of Illyricum was elevated, according to ancient
      custom, on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed king of the
      Visigoths. 23 Armed with this double power, seated on the verge
      of the two empires, he alternately sold his deceitful promises to
      the courts of Arcadius and Honorius; till he declared and
      executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the West.
      The provinces of Europe which belonged to the Eastern emperor,
      were already exhausted; those of Asia were inaccessible; and the
      strength of Constantinople had resisted his attack. But he was
      tempted by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he
      had twice visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the Gothic
      standard on the walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the
      accumulated spoils of three hundred triumphs. 25

      But as it was not accomplished within the term which has been
      rashly fixed the interpreters escaped through an ambiguous
      meaning.]

      The scarcity of facts, 26 and the uncertainty of dates, 27 oppose
      our attempts to describe the circumstances of the first invasion
      of Italy by the arms of Alaric. His march, perhaps from
      Thessalonica, through the warlike and hostile country of
      Pannonia, as far as the foot of the Julian Alps; his passage of
      those mountains, which were strongly guarded by troops and
      intrenchments; the siege of Aquileia, and the conquest of the
      provinces of Istria and Venetia, appear to have employed a
      considerable time. Unless his operations were extremely cautious
      and slow, the length of the interval would suggest a probable
      suspicion, that the Gothic king retreated towards the banks of
      the Danube; and reenforced his army with fresh swarms of
      Barbarians, before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart
      of Italy. Since the public and important events escape the
      diligence of the historian, he may amuse himself with
      contemplating, for a moment, the influence of the arms of Alaric
      on the fortunes of two obscure individuals, a presbyter of
      Aquileia and a husbandman of Verona. The learned Rufinus, who was
      summoned by his enemies to appear before a Roman synod, 28 wisely
      preferred the dangers of a besieged city; and the Barbarians, who
      furiously shook the walls of Aquileia, might save him from the
      cruel sentence of another heretic, who, at the request of the
      same bishops, was severely whipped, and condemned to perpetual
      exile on a desert island. 29 The old man, 30 who had passed his
      simple and innocent life in the neighborhood of Verona, was a
      stranger to the quarrels both of kings and of bishops; his
      pleasures, his desires, his knowledge, were confined within the
      little circle of his paternal farm; and a staff supported his
      aged steps, on the same ground where he had sported in his
      infancy. Yet even this humble and rustic felicity (which Claudian
      describes with so much truth and feeling) was still exposed to
      the undistinguishing rage of war. His trees, his old contemporary
      trees, 31 must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country; a
      detachment of Gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his
      family; and the power of Alaric could destroy this happiness,
      which he was not able either to taste or to bestow. “Fame,” says
      the poet, “encircling with terror her gloomy wings, proclaimed
      the march of the Barbarian army, and filled Italy with
      consternation:” the apprehensions of each individual were
      increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune: and
      the most timid, who had already embarked their valuable effects,
      meditated their escape to the Island of Sicily, or the African
      coast. The public distress was aggravated by the fears and
      reproaches of superstition. 32 Every hour produced some horrid
      tale of strange and portentous accidents; the Pagans deplored the
      neglect of omens, and the interruption of sacrifices; but the
      Christians still derived some comfort from the powerful
      intercession of the saints and martyrs. 33

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part II.

      The emperor Honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by
      the preeminence of fear, as well as of rank. The pride and luxury
      in which he was educated, had not allowed him to suspect, that
      there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to
      invade the repose of the successor of Augustus. The arts of
      flattery concealed the impending danger, till Alaric approached
      the palace of Milan. But when the sound of war had awakened the
      young emperor, instead of flying to arms with the spirit, or even
      the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to those timid
      counsellors, who proposed to convey his sacred person, and his
      faithful attendants, to some secure and distant station in the
      provinces of Gaul. Stilicho alone 34 had courage and authority to
      resist his disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned Rome
      and Italy to the Barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had
      been lately detached to the Rhaetian frontier, and as the
      resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of
      the West could only promise, that if the court of Milan would
      maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return
      with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king. Without
      losing a moment, (while each moment was so important to the
      public safety,) Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian Lake,
      ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an
      Alpine winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected
      presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of
      Rhaetia. 35 The Barbarians, perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni,
      respected the firmness of a chief, who still assumed the language
      of command; and the choice which he condescended to make, of a
      select number of their bravest youth, was considered as a mark of
      his esteem and favor. The cohorts, who were delivered from the
      neighboring foe, diligently repaired to the Imperial standard;
      and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the
      West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius
      and of Italy. The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned; and the
      safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans,
      and the ancient terror of the Roman name. Even the legion, which
      had been stationed to guard the wall of Britain against the
      Caledonians of the North, was hastily recalled; 36 and a numerous
      body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the
      service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his
      general. The prudence and vigor of Stilicho were conspicuous on
      this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of
      the falling empire. The legions of Rome, which had long since
      languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were
      exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars; and it was found
      impossible, without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to
      assemble an army for the defence of Italy.

      34 (return) [ Solus erat Stilicho, &c., is the exclusive
      commendation which Claudian bestows, (del Bell. Get. 267,)

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part III.

      When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded
      palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his
      absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might
      retard their march. He principally depended on the rivers of
      Italy, the Adige, the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua, which,
      in the winter or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting
      of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous
      torrents. 37 But the season happened to be remarkably dry: and
      the Goths could traverse, without impediment, the wide and stony
      beds, whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow
      stream. The bridge and passage of the Addua were secured by a
      strong detachment of the Gothic army; and as Alaric approached
      the walls, or rather the suburbs, of Milan, he enjoyed the proud
      satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the Romans fly before him.
      Honorius, accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs,
      hastily retreated towards the Alps, with a design of securing his
      person in the city of Arles, which had often been the royal
      residence of his predecessors. 3711 But Honorius 38 had scarcely
      passed the Po, before he was overtaken by the speed of the Gothic
      cavalry; 39 since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek
      a temporary shelter within the fortifications of Asta, a town of
      Liguria or Piemont, situate on the banks of the Tanarus. 40 The
      siege of an obscure place, which contained so rich a prize, and
      seemed incapable of a long resistance, was instantly formed, and
      indefatigably pressed, by the king of the Goths; and the bold
      declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that his
      breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably
      obtain much credit, even in his own court. 41 In the last, and
      almost hopeless extremity, after the Barbarians had already
      proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the Imperial captive
      was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length
      the presence, of the hero, whom he had so long expected. At the
      head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho swam the stream
      of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the
      attack of the bridge; the passage of the Po was an enterprise of
      much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in
      which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of
      Asta, revived the hopes, and vindicated the honor, of Rome.
      Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory, the Barbarian was
      gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the West, who
      successively issued through all the passes of the Alps; his
      quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted; and the
      vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of
      fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. A
      military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the
      Gothic nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in
      furs, and whose stern countenances were marked with honorable
      wounds. They weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt
      against the advantage of securing their plunder; and they
      recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat. In this
      important debate, Alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of
      Rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their
      achievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating
      speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved
      to find in Italy either a kingdom or a grave. 42

      The loose discipline of the Barbarians always exposed them to the
      danger of a surprise; but, instead of choosing the dissolute
      hours of riot and intemperance, Stilicho resolved to attack the
      Christian Goths, whilst they were devoutly employed in
      celebrating the festival of Easter. 43 The execution of the
      stratagem, or, as it was termed by the clergy of the sacrilege,
      was intrusted to Saul, a Barbarian and a Pagan, who had served,
      however, with distinguished reputation among the veteran generals
      of Theodosius. The camp of the Goths, which Alaric had pitched in
      the neighborhood of Pollentia, 44 was thrown into confusion by
      the sudden and impetuous charge of the Imperial cavalry; but, in
      a few moments, the undaunted genius of their leader gave them an
      order, and a field of battle; and, as soon as they had recovered
      from their astonishment, the pious confidence, that the God of
      the Christians would assert their cause, added new strength to
      their native valor. In this engagement, which was long maintained
      with equal courage and success, the chief of the Alani, whose
      diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved
      his suspected loyalty, by the zeal with which he fought, and
      fell, in the service of the republic; and the fame of this
      gallant Barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of
      Claudian, since the poet, who celebrates his virtue, has omitted
      the mention of his name. His death was followed by the flight and
      dismay of the squadrons which he commanded; and the defeat of the
      wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric, if
      Stilicho had not immediately led the Roman and Barbarian infantry
      to the attack. The skill of the general, and the bravery of the
      soldiers, surmounted every obstacle. In the evening of the bloody
      day, the Goths retreated from the field of battle; the
      intrenchments of their camp were forced, and the scene of rapine
      and slaughter made some atonement for the calamities which they
      had inflicted on the subjects of the empire. 45 The magnificent
      spoils of Corinth and Argos enriched the veterans of the West;
      the captive wife of Alaric, who had impatiently claimed his
      promise of Roman jewels and Patrician handmaids, 46 was reduced
      to implore the mercy of the insulting foe; and many thousand
      prisoners, released from the Gothic chains, dispersed through the
      provinces of Italy the praises of their heroic deliverer. The
      triumph of Stilicho 47 was compared by the poet, and perhaps by
      the public, to that of Marius; who, in the same part of Italy,
      had encountered and destroyed another army of Northern
      Barbarians. The huge bones, and the empty helmets, of the Cimbri
      and of the Goths, would easily be confounded by succeeding
      generations; and posterity might erect a common trophy to the
      memory of the two most illustrious generals, who had vanquished,
      on the same memorable ground, the two most formidable enemies of
      Rome. 48

      geography of a poet. Verselle and Pollentia are sixty miles from
      each other; and the latitude is still greater, if the Cimbri were
      defeated in the wide and barren plain of Verona, (Maffei, Verona
      Illustrata, P. i. p. 54-62.)]

      The eloquence of Claudian 49 has celebrated, with lavish
      applause, the victory of Pollentia, one of the most glorious days
      in the life of his patron; but his reluctant and partial muse
      bestows more genuine praise on the character of the Gothic king.
      His name is, indeed, branded with the reproachful epithets of
      pirate and robber, to which the conquerors of every age are so
      justly entitled; but the poet of Stilicho is compelled to
      acknowledge that Alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind,
      which rises superior to every misfortune, and derives new
      resources from adversity. After the total defeat of his infantry,
      he escaped, or rather withdrew, from the field of battle, with
      the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken. Without
      wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave
      companions, he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the
      captive images of a Gothic king; 50 and boldly resolved to break
      through the unguarded passes of the Apennine, to spread
      desolation over the fruitful face of Tuscany, and to conquer or
      die before the gates of Rome. The capital was saved by the active
      and incessant diligence of Stilicho; but he respected the despair
      of his enemy; and, instead of committing the fate of the republic
      to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the
      absence of the Barbarians. The spirit of Alaric would have
      rejected such terms, the permission of a retreat, and the offer
      of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a
      limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains
      who had raised him, for their service, above the rank of his
      equals; they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful
      general, and many of them were tempted to consult their interest
      by a private negotiation with the minister of Honorius. The king
      submitted to the voice of his people, ratified the treaty with
      the empire of the West, and repassed the Po with the remains of
      the flourishing army which he had led into Italy. A considerable
      part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his motions;
      and Stilicho, who maintained a secret correspondence with some of
      the Barbarian chiefs, was punctually apprised of the designs that
      were formed in the camp and council of Alaric. The king of the
      Goths, ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid
      achievement, had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona,
      which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps; and,
      directing his march through the territories of those German
      tribes, whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to
      invade, on the side of the Rhine, the wealthy and unsuspecting
      provinces of Gaul. Ignorant of the treason which had already
      betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards
      the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the Imperial
      troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a
      general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. In
      this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of Verona,
      the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had
      sustained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who
      escaped by the swiftness of his horse, must either have been
      slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the Alani had
      not disappointed the measures of the Roman general. Alaric
      secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and
      prepared himself, with undaunted resolution, to maintain a siege
      against the superior numbers of the enemy, who invested him on
      all sides. But he could not oppose the destructive progress of
      hunger and disease; nor was it possible for him to check the
      continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians.
      In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or
      in the moderation of his adversary; and the retreat of the Gothic
      king was considered as the deliverance of Italy. 51 Yet the
      people, and even the clergy, incapable of forming any rational
      judgment of the business of peace and war, presumed to arraign
      the policy of Stilicho, who so often vanquished, so often
      surrounded, and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the
      republic. The first momen of the public safety is devoted to
      gratitude and joy; but the second is diligently occupied by envy
      and calumny. 52

      The citizens of Rome had been astonished by the approach of
      Alaric; and the diligence with which they labored to restore the
      walls of the capital, confessed their own fears, and the decline
      of the empire. After the retreat of the Barbarians, Honorius was
      directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate, and to
      celebrate, in the Imperial city, the auspicious era of the
      Gothic victory, and of his sixth consulship. 53 The suburbs and
      the streets, from the Milvian bridge to the Palatine mount, were
      filled by the Roman people, who, in the space of a hundred years,
      had only thrice been honored with the presence of their
      sovereigns. While their eyes were fixed on the chariot where
      Stilicho was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil,
      they applauded the pomp of a triumph, which was not stained, like
      that of Constantine, or of Theodosius, with civil blood. The
      procession passed under a lofty arch, which had been purposely
      erected: but in less than seven years, the Gothic conquerors of
      Rome might read, if they were able to read, the superb
      inscription of that monument, which attested the total defeat and
      destruction of their nation. 54 The emperor resided several
      months in the capital, and every part of his behavior was
      regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy,
      the senate, and the people of Rome. The clergy was edified by his
      frequent visits and liberal gifts to the shrines of the apostles.
      The senate, who, in the triumphal procession, had been excused
      from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the Imperial
      chariot, was treated with the decent reverence which Stilicho
      always affected for that assembly. The people was repeatedly
      gratified by the attention and courtesy of Honorius in the public
      games, which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence
      not unworthy of the spectator. As soon as the appointed number of
      chariot-races was concluded, the decoration of the Circus was
      suddenly changed; the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various
      and splendid entertainment; and the chase was succeeded by a
      military dance, which seems, in the lively description of
      Claudian, to present the image of a modern tournament.

      In these games of Honorius, the inhuman combats of gladiators 55
      polluted, for the last time, the amphitheater of Rome. The first
      Christian emperor may claim the honor of the first edict which
      condemned the art and amusement of shedding human blood; 56 but
      this benevolent law expressed the wishes of the prince, without
      reforming an inveterate abuse, which degraded a civilized nation
      below the condition of savage cannibals. Several hundred, perhaps
      several thousand, victims were annually slaughtered in the great
      cities of the empire; and the month of December, more peculiarly
      devoted to the combats of gladiators, still exhibited to the eyes
      of the Roman people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty.
      Amidst the general joy of the victory of Pollentia, a Christian
      poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate, by his authority, the
      horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity
      and religion. 57 The pathetic representations of Prudentius were
      less effectual than the generous boldness of Telemachus, an
      Asiatic monk, whose death was more useful to mankind than his
      life. 58 The Romans were provoked by the interruption of their
      pleasures; and the rash monk, who had descended into the arena to
      separate the gladiators, was overwhelmed under a shower of
      stones. But the madness of the people soon subsided; they
      respected the memory of Telemachus, who had deserved the honors
      of martyrdom; and they submitted, without a murmur, to the laws
      of Honorius, which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the
      amphitheater. 5811 The citizens, who adhered to the manners of
      their ancestors, might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of
      a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude,
      which accustomed the Romans to the sight of blood, and to the
      contempt of death; a vain and cruel prejudice, so nobly confuted
      by the valor of ancient Greece, and of modern Europe! 59

      The recent danger, to which the person of the emperor had been
      exposed in the defenceless palace of Milan, urged him to seek a
      retreat in some inaccessible fortress of Italy, where he might
      securely remain, while the open country was covered by a deluge
      of Barbarians. On the coast of the Adriatic, about ten or twelve
      miles from the most southern of the seven mouths of the Po, the
      Thessalians had founded the ancient colony of Ravenna, 60 which
      they afterwards resigned to the natives of Umbria. Augustus, who
      had observed the opportunity of the place, prepared, at the
      distance of three miles from the old town, a capacious harbor,
      for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war. This
      naval establishment, which included the arsenals and magazines,
      the barracks of the troops, and the houses of the artificers,
      derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the
      Roman fleet; the intermediate space was soon filled with
      buildings and inhabitants, and the three extensive and populous
      quarters of Ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most
      important cities of Italy. The principal canal of Augustus poured
      a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the
      city, to the entrance of the harbor; the same waters were
      introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls;
      they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals, into
      every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of
      small islands; the communication was maintained only by the use
      of boats and bridges; and the houses of Ravenna, whose appearance
      may be compared to that of Venice, were raised on the foundation
      of wooden piles. The adjacent country, to the distance of many
      miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial
      causeway, which connected Ravenna with the continent, might be
      easily guarded or destroyed, on the approach of a hostile army
      These morasses were interspersed, however, with vineyards: and
      though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops, the town
      enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water. 61
      The air, instead of receiving the sickly, and almost
      pestilential, exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was
      distinguished, like the neighborhood of Alexandria, as uncommonly
      pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to
      the regular tides of the Adriatic, which swept the canals,
      interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters, and
      floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the
      heart of Ravenna. The gradual retreat of the sea has left the
      modern city at the distance of four miles from the Adriatic; and
      as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian era, the
      port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards; and a
      lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet
      once rode at anchor. 62 Even this alteration contributed to
      increase the natural strength of the place, and the shallowness
      of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of
      the enemy. This advantageous situation was fortified by art and
      labor; and in the twentieth year of his age, the emperor of the
      West, anxious only for his personal safety, retired to the
      perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna. The
      example of Honorius was imitated by his feeble successors, the
      Gothic kings, and afterwards the Exarchs, who occupied the throne
      and palace of the emperors; and till the middle of the eight
      century, Ravenna was considered as the seat of government, and
      the capital of Italy. 63

      The fears of Honorius were not without foundation, nor were his
      precautions without effect. While Italy rejoiced in her
      deliverance from the Goths, a furious tempest was excited among
      the nations of Germany, who yielded to the irresistible impulse
      that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern
      extremity of the continent of Asia. The Chinese annals, as they
      have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age,
      may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of
      the fall of the Roman empire. The extensive territory to the
      north of the great wall was possessed, after the flight of the
      Huns, by the victorious Sienpi, who were sometimes broken into
      independent tribes, and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief;
      till at length, styling themselves Topa, or masters of the earth,
      they acquired a more solid consistence, and a more formidable
      power. The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the
      eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms; they
      invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and
      these fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the
      vanquished people, founded an Imperial dynasty, which reigned
      near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of
      the monarchy. Some generations before they ascended the throne of
      China, one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a
      slave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valor, but who was
      tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and
      to range the desert at the head of a hundred followers. This gang
      of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous
      people, distinguished by the appellation of Geougen; and their
      hereditary chieftains, the posterity of Moko the slave, assumed
      their rank among the Scythian monarchs. The youth of Toulun, the
      greatest of his descendants, was exercised by those misfortunes
      which are the school of heroes. He bravely struggled with
      adversity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the
      legislator of his nation, and the conqueror of Tartary. His
      troops were distributed into regular bands of a hundred and of a
      thousand men; cowards were stoned to death; the most splendid
      honors were proposed as the reward of valor; and Toulun, who had
      knowledge enough to despise the learning of China, adopted only
      such arts and institutions as were favorable to the military
      spirit of his government. His tents, which he removed in the
      winter season to a more southern latitude, were pitched, during
      the summer, on the fruitful banks of the Selinga. His conquests
      stretched from Corea far beyond the River Irtish. He vanquished,
      in the country to the north of the Caspian Sea, the nation of the
      Huns; and the new title of Khan, or Cagan, expressed the fame and
      power which he derived from this memorable victory. 64

      The chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it
      passes from the Volga to the Vistula, through the dark interval
      which separates the extreme limits of the Chinese, and of the
      Roman, geography. Yet the temper of the Barbarians, and the
      experience of successive emigrations, sufficiently declare, that
      the Huns, who were oppressed by the arms of the Geougen, soon
      withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor. The countries
      towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes;
      and their hasty flight, which they soon converted into a bold
      attack, would more naturally be directed towards the rich and
      level plains, through which the Vistula gently flows into the
      Baltic Sea. The North must again have been alarmed, and agitated,
      by the invasion of the Huns; 6411 and the nations who retreated
      before them must have pressed with incumbent weight on the
      confines of Germany. 65 The inhabitants of those regions, which
      the ancients have assigned to the Suevi, the Vandals, and the
      Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the
      fugitives of Sarmatia their woods and morasses; or at least of
      discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the
      Roman empire. 66 About four years after the victorious Toulun had
      assumed the title of Khan of the Geougen, another Barbarian, the
      haughty Rhodogast, or Radagaisus, 67 marched from the northern
      extremities of Germany almost to the gates of Rome, and left the
      remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the West. The
      Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the strength of
      this mighty host; but the Alani, who had found a hospitable
      reception in their new seats, added their active cavalry to the
      heavy infantry of the Germans; and the Gothic adventurers crowded
      so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that by some
      historians, he has been styled the King of the Goths. Twelve
      thousand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble
      birth, or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van; 68 and the
      whole multitude, which was not less than two hundred thousand
      fighting men, might be increased, by the accession of women, of
      children, and of slaves, to the amount of four hundred thousand
      persons. This formidable emigration issued from the same coast of
      the Baltic, which had poured forth the myriads of the Cimbri and
      Teutones, to assault Rome and Italy in the vigor of the republic.
      After the departure of those Barbarians, their native country,
      which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness, long
      ramparts, and gigantic moles, 69 remained, during some ages, a
      vast and dreary solitude; till the human species was renewed by
      the powers of generation, and the vacancy was filled by the
      influx of new inhabitants. The nations who now usurp an extent of
      land which they are unable to cultivate, would soon be assisted
      by the industrious poverty of their neighbors, if the government
      of Europe did not protect the claims of dominion and property.

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part IV.

      The correspondence of nations was, in that age, so imperfect and
      precarious, that the revolutions of the North might escape the
      knowledge of the court of Ravenna; till the dark cloud, which was
      collected along the coast of the Baltic, burst in thunder upon
      the banks of the Upper Danube. The emperor of the West, if his
      ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending
      danger, was satisfied with being the occasion, and the spectator,
      of the war. 70 The safety of Rome was intrusted to the counsels,
      and the sword, of Stilicho; but such was the feeble and exhausted
      state of the empire, that it was impossible to restore the
      fortifications of the Danube, or to prevent, by a vigorous
      effort, the invasion of the Germans. 71 The hopes of the vigilant
      minister of Honorius were confined to the defence of Italy. He
      once more abandoned the provinces, recalled the troops, pressed
      the new levies, which were rigorously exacted, and
      pusillanimously eluded; employed the most efficacious means to
      arrest, or allure, the deserters; and offered the gift of
      freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the slaves who would
      enlist. 72 By these efforts he painfully collected, from the
      subjects of a great empire, an army of thirty or forty thousand
      men, which, in the days of Scipio or Camillus, would have been
      instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of
      Rome. 73 The thirty legions of Stilicho were reenforced by a
      large body of Barbarian auxiliaries; the faithful Alani were
      personally attached to his service; and the troops of Huns and of
      Goths, who marched under the banners of their native princes,
      Huldin and Sarus, were animated by interest and resentment to
      oppose the ambition of Radagaisus. The king of the confederate
      Germans passed, without resistance, the Alps, the Po, and the
      Apennine; leaving on one hand the inaccessible palace of
      Honorius, securely buried among the marshes of Ravenna; and, on
      the other, the camp of Stilicho, who had fixed his head-quarters
      at Ticinum, or Pavia, but who seems to have avoided a decisive
      battle, till he had assembled his distant forces. Many cities of
      Italy were pillaged, or destroyed; and the siege of Florence, 74
      by Radagaisus, is one of the earliest events in the history of
      that celebrated republic; whose firmness checked and delayed the
      unskillful fury of the Barbarians. The senate and people trembled
      at their approach within a hundred and eighty miles of Rome; and
      anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped, with the
      new perils to which they were exposed. Alaric was a Christian and
      a soldier, the leader of a disciplined army; who understood the
      laws of war, who respected the sanctity of treaties, and who had
      familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same
      camps, and the same churches. The savage Radagaisus was a
      stranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language, of
      the civilized nations of the South. The fierceness of his temper
      was exasperated by cruel superstition; and it was universally
      believed, that he had bound himself, by a solemn vow, to reduce
      the city into a heap of stones and ashes, and to sacrifice the
      most illustrious of the Roman senators on the altars of those
      gods who were appeased by human blood. The public danger, which
      should have reconciled all domestic animosities, displayed the
      incurable madness of religious faction. The oppressed votaries of
      Jupiter and Mercury respected, in the implacable enemy of Rome,
      the character of a devout Pagan; loudly declared, that they were
      more apprehensive of the sacrifices, than of the arms, of
      Radagaisus; and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their
      country, which condemned the faith of their Christian
      adversaries. 75 7511

      be the triumph of idolatry. Compare ii. 25—M.]

      Florence was reduced to the last extremity; and the fainting
      courage of the citizens was supported only by the authority of
      St. Ambrose; who had communicated, in a dream, the promise of a
      speedy deliverance. 76 On a sudden, they beheld, from their
      walls, the banners of Stilicho, who advanced, with his united
      force, to the relief of the faithful city; and who soon marked
      that fatal spot for the grave of the Barbarian host. The apparent
      contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat
      of Radagaisus, may be reconciled without offering much violence
      to their respective testimonies. Orosius and Augustin, who were
      intimately connected by friendship and religion, ascribed this
      miraculous victory to the providence of God, rather than to the
      valor of man. 77 They strictly exclude every idea of chance, or
      even of bloodshed; and positively affirm, that the Romans, whose
      camp was the scene of plenty and idleness, enjoyed the distress
      of the Barbarians, slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge
      of the hills of Faesulae, which rise above the city of Florence.
      Their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the
      Christian army was killed, or even wounded, may be dismissed with
      silent contempt; but the rest of the narrative of Augustin and
      Orosius is consistent with the state of the war, and the
      character of Stilicho. Conscious that he commanded the last army
      of the republic, his prudence would not expose it, in the open
      field, to the headstrong fury of the Germans. The method of
      surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation, which
      he had twice employed against the Gothic king, was repeated on a
      larger scale, and with more considerable effect. The examples of
      Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the
      Roman warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrrachium, which
      connected twenty-four castles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart
      of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which
      might confine, and starve, the most numerous host of Barbarians.
      78 The Roman troops had less degenerated from the industry, than
      from the valor, of their ancestors; and if their servile and
      laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers, Tuscany could
      supply many thousand peasants, who would labor, though, perhaps,
      they would not fight, for the salvation of their native country.
      The imprisoned multitude of horses and men 79 was gradually
      destroyed, by famine rather than by the sword; but the Romans
      were exposed, during the progress of such an extensive work, to
      the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy. The despair of the
      hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the
      fortifications of Stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge
      the ardor of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to
      assault the camp of the Germans; and these various incidents
      might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the
      narrative of Zosimus, and the Chronicles of Prosper and
      Marcellinus. 80 A seasonable supply of men and provisions had
      been introduced into the walls of Florence, and the famished host
      of Radagaisus was in its turn besieged. The proud monarch of so
      many warlike nations, after the loss of his bravest warriors, was
      reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in
      the clemency of Stilicho. 81 But the death of the royal captive,
      who was ignominiously beheaded, disgraced the triumph of Rome and
      of Christianity; and the short delay of his execution was
      sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and
      deliberate cruelty. 82 The famished Germans, who escaped the fury
      of the auxiliaries, were sold as slaves, at the contemptible
      price of as many single pieces of gold; but the difference of
      food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy
      strangers; and it was observed, that the inhuman purchasers,
      instead of reaping the fruits of their labor were soon obliged to
      provide the expense of their interment. Stilicho informed the
      emperor and the senate of his success; and deserved, a second
      time, the glorious title of Deliverer of Italy. 83

      appears, he was taken in arms, cannot deserve Gibbon’s severe
      condemnation. Mr. Herbert (notes to his poem of Attila, p. 317)

      The fame of the victory, and more especially of the miracle, has
      encouraged a vain persuasion, that the whole army, or rather
      nation, of Germans, who migrated from the shores of the Baltic,
      miserably perished under the walls of Florence. Such indeed was
      the fate of Radagaisus himself, of his brave and faithful
      companions, and of more than one third of the various multitude
      of Sueves and Vandals, of Alani and Burgundians, who adhered to
      the standard of their general. 84 The union of such an army might
      excite our surprise, but the causes of separation are obvious and

      host, which must have exceeded the number of one hundred thousand
      men, still remained in arms, between the Apennine and the Alps,
      or between the Alps and the Danube. It is uncertain whether they
      attempted to revenge the death of their general; but their
      irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of
      Stilicho, who opposed their march, and facilitated their retreat;
      who considered the safety of Rome and Italy as the great object
      of his care, and who sacrificed, with too much indifference, the
      wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces. 85 The

      Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of
      Germany, who inhabited the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were
      disappointed. The Alemanni preserved a state of inactive
      neutrality; and the Franks distinguished their zeal and courage
      in the defence of the of the empire. In the rapid progress down
      the Rhine, which was the first act of the administration of
      Stilicho, he had applied himself, with peculiar attention, to
      secure the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the
      irreconcilable enemies of peace and of the republic. Marcomir,
      one of their kings, was publicly convicted, before the tribunal
      of the Roman magistrate, of violating the faith of treaties. He
      was sentenced to a mild, but distant exile, in the province of
      Tuscany; and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far
      from exciting the resentment of his subjects, that they punished
      with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his
      brother; and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes, who
      were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho. 87 When
      the limits of Gaul and Germany were shaken by the northern
      emigration, the Franks bravely encountered the single force of
      the Vandals; who, regardless of the lessons of adversity, had
      again separated their troops from the standard of their Barbarian
      allies. They paid the penalty of their rashness; and twenty
      thousand Vandals, with their king Godigisclus, were slain in the
      field of battle. The whole people must have been extirpated, if
      the squadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not
      trampled down the infantry of the Franks; who, after an honorable
      resistance, were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest. The
      victorious confederates pursued their march, and on the last day
      of the year, in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most
      probably frozen, they entered, without opposition, the
      defenceless provinces of Gaul. This memorable passage of the
      Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the Burgundians, who never
      afterwards retreated, may be considered as the fall of the Roman
      empire in the countries beyond the Alps; and the barriers, which
      had so long separated the savage and the civilized nations of the
      earth, were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground. 88

      While the peace of Germany was secured by the attachment of the
      Franks, and the neutrality of the Alemanni, the subjects of Rome,
      unconscious of their approaching calamities, enjoyed the state of
      quiet and prosperity, which had seldom blessed the frontiers of
      Gaul. Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the
      pastures of the Barbarians; their huntsmen penetrated, without
      fear or danger, into the darkest recesses of the Hercynian wood.
      89 The banks of the Rhine were crowned, like those of the Tyber,
      with elegant houses, and well-cultivated farms; and if a poet
      descended the river, he might express his doubt, on which side
      was situated the territory of the Romans. 90 This scene of peace
      and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert; and the prospect
      of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of
      nature from the desolation of man. The flourishing city of Mentz
      was surprised and destroyed; and many thousand Christians were
      inhumanly massacred in the church. Worms perished after a long
      and obstinate siege; Strasburgh, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Arras,
      Amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the German yoke; and
      the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine
      over the greatest part of the seventeen provinces of Gaul. That
      rich and extensive country, as far as the ocean, the Alps, and
      the Pyrenees, was delivered to the Barbarians, who drove before
      them, in a promiscuous crowd, the bishop, the senator, and the
      virgin, laden with the spoils of their houses and altars. 91 The
      ecclesiastics, to whom we are indebted for this vague description
      of the public calamities, embraced the opportunity of exhorting
      the Christians to repent of the sins which had provoked the
      Divine Justice, and to renounce the perishable goods of a
      wretched and deceitful world. But as the Pelagian controversy, 92
      which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination,
      soon became the serious employment of the Latin clergy, the
      Providence which had decreed, or foreseen, or permitted, such a
      train of moral and natural evils, was rashly weighed in the
      imperfect and fallacious balance of reason. The crimes, and the
      misfortunes, of the suffering people, were presumptuously
      compared with those of their ancestors; and they arraigned the
      Divine Justice, which did not exempt from the common destruction
      the feeble, the guiltless, the infant portion of the human
      species. These idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of
      nature, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with
      industry, and safety with valor. The timid and selfish policy of
      the court of Ravenna might recall the Palatine legions for the
      protection of Italy; the remains of the stationary troops might
      be unequal to the arduous task; and the Barbarian auxiliaries
      might prefer the unbounded license of spoil to the benefits of a
      moderate and regular stipend. But the provinces of Gaul were
      filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth, who, in
      the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if
      they had dared to die, would have deserved to vanquish. The
      knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to
      oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an
      invader; and the deficiency of the Barbarians, in arms, as well
      as in discipline, removed the only pretence which excuses the
      submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a
      veteran army. When France was invaded by Charles V., he inquired
      of a prisoner, how many days Paris might be distant from the
      frontier; “Perhaps twelve, but they will be days of battle:” 93
      such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that
      ambitious prince. The subjects of Honorius, and those of Francis
      I., were animated by a very different spirit; and in less than
      two years, the divided troops of the savages of the Baltic, whose
      numbers, were they fairly stated, would appear contemptible,
      advanced, without a combat, to the foot of the Pyrenean
      Mountains.

      In the early part of the reign of Honorius, the vigilance of
      Stilicho had successfully guarded the remote island of Britain
      from her incessant enemies of the ocean, the mountains, and the
      Irish coast. 94 But those restless Barbarians could not neglect
      the fair opportunity of the Gothic war, when the walls and
      stations of the province were stripped of the Roman troops. If
      any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the Italian
      expedition, their faithful report of the court and character of
      Honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance,
      and to exasperate the seditious temper of the British army. The
      spirit of revolt, which had formerly disturbed the age of
      Gallienus, was revived by the capricious violence of the
      soldiers; and the unfortunate, perhaps the ambitious, candidates,
      who were the objects of their choice, were the instruments, and
      at length the victims, of their passion. 95 Marcus was the first
      whom they placed on the throne, as the lawful emperor of Britain
      and of the West. They violated, by the hasty murder of Marcus,
      the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves; and
      their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an
      honorable epitaph on his tomb. Gratian was the next whom they
      adorned with the diadem and the purple; and, at the end of four
      months, Gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor. The
      memory of the great Constantine, whom the British legions had
      given to the church and to the empire, suggested the singular
      motive of their third choice. They discovered in the ranks a
      private soldier of the name of Constantine, and their impetuous
      levity had already seated him on the throne, before they
      perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious
      appellation. 96 Yet the authority of Constantine was less
      precarious, and his government was more successful, than the
      transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian. The danger of leaving
      his inactive troops in those camps, which had been twice polluted
      with blood and sedition, urged him to attempt the reduction of
      the Western provinces. He landed at Boulogne with an
      inconsiderable force; and after he had reposed himself some days,
      he summoned the cities of Gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the
      Barbarians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign. They obeyed
      the summons without reluctance. The neglect of the court of
      Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of
      allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any
      circumstances of change, without apprehension, and, perhaps, with
      some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves, that the
      troops, the authority, and even the name of a Roman emperor, who
      fixed his residence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country
      from the rage of the Barbarians. The first successes of
      Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans, were
      magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive
      victories; which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon
      reduced to their just value. His negotiations procured a short
      and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the Barbarians were
      engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to
      undertake the defence of the Rhine, these expensive and uncertain
      treaties, instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the Gallic
      frontier, served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince, and
      to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic.
      Elated, however, with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer
      of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a
      more pressing and personal danger. Sarus the Goth was ordered to
      lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius;
      and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in
      this domestic quarrel. After the loss of his two bravest
      generals, Justinian and Nevigastes, the former of whom was slain
      in the field of battle, the latter in a peaceful but treacherous
      interview, Constantine fortified himself within the walls of
      Vienna. The place was ineffectually attacked seven days; and the
      Imperial army supported, in a precipitate retreat, the ignominy
      of purchasing a secure passage from the freebooters and outlaws
      of the Alps. 97 Those mountains now separated the dominions of
      two rival monarchs; and the fortifications of the double frontier
      were guarded by the troops of the empire, whose arms would have
      been more usefully employed to maintain the Roman limits against
      the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia.

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part V.

      On the side of the Pyrenees, the ambition of Constantine might be
      justified by the proximity of danger; but his throne was soon
      established by the conquest, or rather submission, of Spain;
      which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual
      subordination, and received the laws and magistrates of the
      Gallic præfecture. The only opposition which was made to the
      authority of Constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of
      government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal
      and interest of the family of Theodosius. Four brothers 98 had
      obtained, by the favor of their kinsman, the deceased emperor, an
      honorable rank and ample possessions in their native country; and
      the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the
      service of his son. After an unsuccessful effort to maintain
      their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania,
      they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at
      their own expense, a considerable body of slaves and dependants,
      and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenean
      Mountains. This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the
      sovereign of Gaul and Britain; and he was compelled to negotiate
      with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the
      Spanish war. They were distinguished by the title of Honorians;
      99 a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to
      their lawful sovereign; and if it should candidly be allowed that
      the Scots were influenced by any partial affection for a British
      prince, the Moors and the Marcomanni could be tempted only by the
      profuse liberality of the usurper, who distributed among the
      Barbarians the military, and even the civil, honors of Spain. The
      nine bands of Honorians, which may be easily traced on the
      establishment of the Western empire, could not exceed the number
      of five thousand men: yet this inconsiderable force was
      sufficient to terminate a war, which had threatened the power and
      safety of Constantine. The rustic army of the Theodosian family
      was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees: two of the brothers
      had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy, or the East; the
      other two, after an interval of suspense, were executed at Arles;
      and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace,
      he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his
      generous kinsmen. Such were the feeble arms which decided the
      possession of the Western provinces of Europe, from the wall of
      Antoninus to the columns of Hercules. The events of peace and war
      have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view
      of the historians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the
      causes, and of the effects, of the most important revolutions.
      But the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even
      the last resource of a despotic government; and the revenue of
      exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service
      of a discontented and pusillanimous people.

      The poet, whose flattery has ascribed to the Roman eagle the
      victories of Pollentia and Verona, pursues the hasty retreat of
      Alaric, from the confines of Italy, with a horrid train of
      imaginary spectres, such as might hover over an army of
      Barbarians, which was almost exterminated by war, famine, and
      disease. 100 In the course of this unfortunate expedition, the
      king of the Goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss;
      and his harassed forces required an interval of repose, to
      recruit their numbers and revive their confidence. Adversity had
      exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his
      valor invited to the Gothic standard the bravest of the Barbarian
      warriors; who, from the Euxine to the Rhine, were agitated by the
      desire of rapine and conquest. He had deserved the esteem, and he
      soon accepted the friendship, of Stilicho himself. Renouncing the
      service of the emperor of the East, Alaric concluded, with the
      court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was
      declared master-general of the Roman armies throughout the
      præfecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the
      true and ancient limits, by the minister of Honorius. 101 The
      execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated,
      or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been
      suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus; and the
      neutrality of the Gothic king may perhaps be compared to the
      indifference of Caesar, who, in the conspiracy of Catiline,
      refused either to assist, or to oppose, the enemy of the
      republic. After the defeat of the Vandals, Stilicho resumed his
      pretensions to the provinces of the East; appointed civil
      magistrates for the administration of justice, and of the
      finances; and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of
      Constantinople the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths.
      The prudence, however, of Stilicho, his aversion to civil war,
      and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may
      countenance the suspicion, that domestic peace, rather than
      foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and that his
      principal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance
      from Italy. This design could not long escape the penetration of
      the Gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a
      treacherous, correspondence with the rival courts; who
      protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations
      in Thessaly and Epirus, and who soon returned to claim the
      extravagant reward of his ineffectual services. From his camp
      near Aemona, 102 on the confines of Italy, he transmitted to the
      emperor of the West a long account of promises, of expenses, and
      of demands; called for immediate satisfaction, and clearly
      intimated the consequences of a refusal. Yet if his conduct was
      hostile, his language was decent and dutiful. He humbly professed
      himself the friend of Stilicho, and the soldier of Honorius;
      offered his person and his troops to march, without delay,
      against the usurper of Gaul; and solicited, as a permanent
      retreat for the Gothic nation, the possession of some vacant
      province of the Western empire.

      The political and secret transactions of two statesmen, who
      labored to deceive each other and the world, must forever have
      been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet, if
      the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of
      light on the correspondence of Alaric and Stilicho. The necessity
      of finding some artificial support for a government, which, from
      a principle, not of moderation, but of weakness, was reduced to
      negotiate with its own subjects, had insensibly revived the
      authority of the Roman senate; and the minister of Honorius
      respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic.
      Stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the Caesars;
      represented, in a studied oration, the actual state of affairs;
      proposed the demands of the Gothic king, and submitted to their
      consideration the choice of peace or war. The senators, as if
      they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred
      years, appeared, on this important occasion, to be inspired by
      the courage, rather than by the wisdom, of their predecessors.

      acclamations, that it was unworthy of the majesty of Rome to
      purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian
      king; and that, in the judgment of a magnanimous people, the
      chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of
      dishonor. The minister, whose pacific intentions were seconded
      only by the voice of a few servile and venal followers, attempted
      to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct,
      and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. “The payment of a
      subsidy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought
      not (such was the language of Stilicho) to be considered in the
      odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ransom, extorted by
      the menaces of a Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully asserted
      the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were
      usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople: he modestly required the
      fair and stipulated recompense of his services; and if he had
      desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had obeyed,
      in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the
      emperor himself. These contradictory orders (he would not
      dissemble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the
      intercession of Serena. The tender piety of his wife had been too
      deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers, the sons of
      her adopted father; and the sentiments of nature had too easily
      prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare.” These
      ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues
      of the palace of Ravenna, were supported by the authority of
      Stilicho; and obtained, after a warm debate, the reluctant
      approbation of the senate. The tumult of virtue and freedom
      subsided; and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was
      granted, under the name of a subsidy, to secure the peace of
      Italy, and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths.
      Lampadius alone, one of the most illustrious members of the
      assembly, still persisted in his dissent; exclaimed, with a loud
      voice, “This is not a treaty of peace, but of servitude;” 103 and
      escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately
      retiring to the sanctuary of a Christian church. [See Palace Of
      The Caesars]

      103 (return) [ Zosimus, l. v. p. 338, 339. He repeats the words
      of Lampadius, as they were spoke in Latin, “Non est ista pax, sed
      pactio servi tutis,” and then translates them into Greek for the
      benefit of his readers. * Note: From Cicero’s XIIth Philippic,
      14.—M.]

      But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end; and the proud
      minister might perceive the symptoms of his approaching disgrace.
      The generous boldness of Lampadius had been applauded; and the
      senate, so patiently resigned to a long servitude, rejected with
      disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom. The troops,
      who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions,
      were exasperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the
      Barbarians: and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of
      the minister the public misfortunes, which were the natural
      consequence of their own degeneracy. Yet Stilicho might have
      continued to brave the clamors of the people, and even of the
      soldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the
      feeble mind of his pupil. But the respectful attachment of
      Honorius was converted into fear, suspicion, and hatred. The
      crafty Olympius, 104 who concealed his vices under the mask of
      Christian piety, had secretly undermined the benefactor, by whose
      favor he was promoted to the honorable offices of the Imperial
      palace. Olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor, who had
      attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without
      weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed
      his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the
      designs of Stilicho, who already meditated the death of his
      sovereign, with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the
      head of his son Eucherius. The emperor was instigated, by his new
      favorite, to assume the tone of independent dignity; and the
      minister was astonished to find, that secret resolutions were
      formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his
      interest, or to his intentions. Instead of residing in the palace
      of Rome, Honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to
      the secure fortress of Ravenna. On the first intelligence of the
      death of his brother Arcadius, he prepared to visit
      Constantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a
      guardian, the provinces of the infant Theodosius. 105 The
      representation of the difficulty and expense of such a distant
      expedition, checked this strange and sudden sally of active
      diligence; but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to
      the camp of Pavia, which was composed of the Roman troops, the
      enemies of Stilicho, and his Barbarian auxiliaries, remained
      fixed and unalterable. The minister was pressed, by the advice of
      his confidant, Justinian, a Roman advocate, of a lively and
      penetrating genius, to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his
      reputation and safety. His strenuous but ineffectual efforts
      confirmed the triumph of Olympius; and the prudent lawyer
      withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron.

      exercised a splendid office. His actions justify his character,
      which Zosimus (l. v. p. 340) exposes with visible satisfaction.
      Augustin revered the piety of Olympius, whom he styles a true son
      of the church, (Baronius, Annal. Eccles, Eccles. A.D. 408, No.
      19, &c. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 467, 468.) But
      these praises, which the African saint so unworthily bestows,
      might proceed as well from ignorance as from adulation.]

      Stilicho offered to undertake the journey to Constantinople, that
      he might divert Honorius from the vain attempt. The Eastern
      empire would not have obeyed, and could not have been conquered.]

      In the passage of the emperor through Bologna, a mutiny of the
      guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho;
      who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and
      ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon. After
      this tumult, Honorius embraced, for the last time, the minister
      whom he now considered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to
      the camp of Pavia; where he was received by the loyal
      acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of
      the Gallic war. On the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced,
      as he had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the
      soldiers, whom the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of
      Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. At
      the first signal, they massacred the friends of Stilicho, the
      most illustrious officers of the empire; two Prætorian
      præfects, of Gaul and of Italy; two masters-general of the
      cavalry and infantry; the master of the offices; the quaestor,
      the treasurer, and the count of the domestics. Many lives were
      lost; many houses were plundered; the furious sedition continued
      to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling emperor,
      who was seen in the streets of Pavia without his robes or diadem,
      yielded to the persuasions of his favorite; condemned the memory
      of the slain; and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of
      their assassins. The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled
      the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions; and he
      instantly summoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the
      confederate leaders, who were attached to his service, and would
      be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the assembly
      called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a
      moment’s delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had so
      often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate
      the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to
      fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. Instead of
      executing a resolution, which might have been justified by
      success, Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost. He
      was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the
      fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal
      consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against
      the soldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of
      his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired, with fear and
      indignation. At the hour of midnight, Sarus, a Gothic warrior,
      renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and
      valor, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the
      baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his person,
      and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and
      sleepless, meditated on the dangers of his situation. Stilicho
      escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and, after
      issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to
      shut their gates against the Barbarians, his confidence, or his
      despair, urged him to throw himself into Ravenna, which was
      already in the absolute possession of his enemies. Olympius, who
      had assumed the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed, that
      his rival had embraced, as a suppliant the altar of the Christian
      church. The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was
      incapable of pity or remorse; but he piously affected to elude,
      rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary. Count
      Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of
      day, before the gates of the church of Ravenna. The bishop was
      satisfied by a solemn oath, that the Imperial mandate only
      directed them to secure the person of Stilicho: but as soon as
      the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy
      threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution.
      Stilicho supported, with calm resignation, the injurious names of
      traitor and parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his
      followers, who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue; and,
      with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals,
      submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian. 106

      106 (return) [ Zosimus (l. v. p. 336-345) has copiously, though
      not clearly, related the disgrace and death of Stilicho.

      571, 572,) Sozomen, (l. ix. c. 4,) and Philostorgius, (l. xi. c.
      3, l. xii. c. 2,) afford supplemental hints.]

      The servile crowd of the palace, who had so long adored the
      fortune of Stilicho, affected to insult his fall; and the most
      distant connection with the master-general of the West, which had
      so lately been a title to wealth and honors, was studiously
      denied, and rigorously punished. His family, united by a triple
      alliance with the family of Theodosius, might envy the condition
      of the meanest peasant. The flight of his son Eucherius was
      intercepted; and the death of that innocent youth soon followed
      the divorce of Thermantia, who filled the place of her sister
      Maria; and who, like Maria, had remained a virgin in the Imperial
      bed. 107 The friends of Stilicho, who had escaped the massacre of
      Pavia, were persecuted by the implacable revenge of Olympius; and
      the most exquisite cruelty was employed to extort the confession
      of a treasonable and sacrilegious conspiracy. They died in
      silence: their firmness justified the choice, 108 and perhaps
      absolved the innocence of their patron: and the despotic power,
      which could take his life without a trial, and stigmatize his
      memory without a proof, has no jurisdiction over the impartial
      suffrage of posterity. 109 The services of Stilicho are great and
      manifest; his crimes, as they are vaguely stated in the language
      of flattery and hatred, are obscure at least, and improbable.
      About four months after his death, an edict was published, in the
      name of Honorius, to restore the free communication of the two
      empires, which had been so long interrupted by the public enemy.
      110 The minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the
      prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying Italy to the
      Barbarians; whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia, at
      Verona, and before the walls of Florence. His pretended design of
      placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius, could not
      have been conducted without preparations or accomplices; and the
      ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor,
      till the twentieth year of his age, in the humble station of
      tribune of the notaries. Even the religion of Stilicho was
      arraigned by the malice of his rival. The seasonable, and almost
      miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause
      of the clergy; who asserted, that the restoration of idols, and
      the persecution of the church, would have been the first measure
      of the reign of Eucherius. The son of Stilicho, however, was
      educated in the bosom of Christianity, which his father had
      uniformly professed, and zealously supported. 111 1111 Serena had
      borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of Vesta; 112
      and the Pagans execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister,
      by whose order the Sibylline books, the oracles of Rome, had been
      committed to the flames. 113 The pride and power of Stilicho
      constituted his real guilt. An honorable reluctance to shed the
      blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the
      success of his unworthy rival; and it is the last humiliation of
      the character of Honorius, that posterity has not condescended to
      reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his
      youth, and the support of his empire.

      Among the train of dependants whose wealth and dignity attracted
      the notice of their own times, _our_ curiosity is excited by the
      celebrated name of the poet Claudian, who enjoyed the favor of
      Stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron. The
      titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the
      Imperial court: he was indebted to the powerful intercession of
      Serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province
      of Africa; 114 and the statute of Claudian, erected in the forum
      of Trajan, was a monument of the taste and liberality of the
      Roman senate. 115 After the praises of Stilicho became offensive
      and criminal, Claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful
      and unforgiving courtier, whom he had provoked by the insolence
      of wit. He had compared, in a lively epigram, the opposite
      characters of two Prætorian præfects of Italy; he contrasts the
      innocent repose of a philosopher, who sometimes resigned the
      hours of business to slumber, perhaps to study, with the
      interesting diligence of a rapacious minister, indefatigable in
      the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious, gain. “How happy,”
      continues Claudian, “how happy might it be for the people of
      Italy, if Mallius could be constantly awake, and if Hadrian would
      always sleep!” 116 The repose of Mallius was not disturbed by
      this friendly and gentle admonition; but the cruel vigilance of
      Hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge, and easily obtained,
      from the enemies of Stilicho, the trifling sacrifice of an
      obnoxious poet. The poet concealed himself, however, during the
      tumult of the revolution; and, consulting the dictates of
      prudence rather than of honor, he addressed, in the form of an
      epistle, a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended
      præfect. He deplores, in mournful strains, the fatal
      indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly;
      submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples
      of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expresses
      his hope that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a
      defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace and
      poverty, and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the
      death of his dearest friends. 117 Whatever might be the success
      of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of
      a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet: but
      the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion, while Claudian is
      read with pleasure in every country which has retained, or
      acquired, the knowledge of the Latin language. If we fairly
      balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge that
      Claudian does not either satisfy, or silence, our reason. It
      would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet
      of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts the heart or
      enlarges the imagination. We should vainly seek, in the poems of
      Claudian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an
      interesting fable; or the just and lively representation of the
      characters and situations of real life. For the service of his
      patron, he published occasional panegyrics and invectives: and
      the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his
      propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. These
      imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the
      poetical virtues of Claudian. He was endowed with the rare and
      precious talent of raising the meanest, of adorning the most
      barren, and of diversifying the most similar, topics: his
      coloring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and
      splendid; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the
      advantages of a cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an
      easy, and sometimes forcible, expression; and a perpetual flow of
      harmonious versification. To these commendations, independent of
      any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit
      which Claudian derived from the unfavorable circumstances of his
      birth. In the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of Egypt,
      118 who had received the education of a Greek, assumed, in a
      mature age, the familiar use, and absolute command, of the Latin
      language; 119 soared above the heads of his feeble
      contemporaries; and placed himself, after an interval of three
      hundred years, among the poets of ancient Rome. 120

      all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts;

      neither flocks, nor herds, nor vines, nor olives. His wealthy
      bride was heiress to them all. But he carried to Africa a
      recommendatory letter from Serena, his Juno, and was made happy,

      Note: M. Beugnot has pointed out one remarkable characteristic of
      Claudian’s poetry, and of the times—his extraordinary religious
      indifference. Here is a poet writing at the actual crisis of the
      complete triumph of the new religion, the visible extinction of
      the old: if we may so speak, a strictly historical poet, whose
      works, excepting his Mythological poem on the rape of Proserpine,
      are confined to temporary subjects, and to the politics of his
      own eventful day; yet, excepting in one or two small and
      indifferent pieces, manifestly written by a Christian, and
      interpolated among his poems, there is no allusion whatever to
      the great religious strife. No one would know the existence of
      Christianity at that period of the world, by reading the works of
      Claudian. His panegyric and his satire preserve the same
      religious impartiality; award their most lavish praise or their
      bitterest invective on Christian or Pagan; he insults the fall of
      Eugenius, and glories in the victories of Theodosius. Under the
      child,—and Honorius never became more than a child,—Christianity
      continued to inflict wounds more and more deadly on expiring
      Paganism. Are the gods of Olympus agitated with apprehension at
      the birth of this new enemy? They are introduced as rejoicing at
      his appearance, and promising long years of glory. The whole
      prophetic choir of Paganism, all the oracles throughout the
      world, are summoned to predict the felicity of his reign. His

      The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often
      assume the appearance, and produce the effects, of a treasonable
      correspondence with the public enemy. If Alaric himself had been
      introduced into the council of Ravenna, he would probably have
      advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the
      ministers of Honorius. 1 The king of the Goths would have
      conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the
      formidable adversary, by whose arms, in Italy, as well as in
      Greece, he had been twice overthrown. Their active and interested
      hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the
      great Stilicho. The valor of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his
      personal, or hereditary, influence over the confederate
      Barbarians, could recommend him only to the friends of their
      country, who despised, or detested, the worthless characters of
      Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius. By the pressing instances of
      the new favorites, these generals, unworthy as they had shown
      themselves of the names of soldiers, 2 were promoted to the
      command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic
      troops. The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the
      edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and
      devout emperor. Honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse
      to the Catholic church, from holding any office in the state;
      obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from
      his religion; and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and
      most skilful officers, who adhered to the Pagan worship, or who
      had imbibed the opinions of Arianism. 3 These measures, so
      advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and might
      perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whether the
      Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the
      inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the
      direction, or at least with the connivance of the Imperial
      ministers. The foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the
      person of Stilicho, lamented his death; but the desire of revenge
      was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their
      wives and children; who were detained as hostages in the strong
      cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most
      valuable effects. At the same hour, and as if by a common signal,
      the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of
      universal massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous
      destruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians.
      Exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the
      tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation
      and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimously swore to
      pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nation who
      had so basely violated the laws of hospitality. By the imprudent
      conduct of the ministers of Honorius, the republic lost the
      assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her
      bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which
      alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred
      from the scale of the Romans into that of the Goths.

      In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the
      Gothic king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy,
      whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel
      and design. From his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric
      attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the
      progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect
      of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance
      of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho: to whose virtues,
      when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute
      of sincere praise and regret. The pressing invitation of the
      malecontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy,
      was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he
      might especially complain, that the Imperial ministers still
      delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of
      gold which had been granted by the Roman senate, either to reward
      his services, or to appease his fury. His decent firmness was
      supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the
      success of his designs. He required a fair and reasonable
      satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances, that, as soon
      as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refused to
      trust the faith of the Romans, unless Ætius and Jason, the sons
      of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his
      camp; but he offered to deliver, in exchange, several of the
      noblest youths of the Gothic nation. The modesty of Alaric was
      interpreted, by the ministers of Ravenna, as a sure evidence of
      his weakness and fear. They disdained either to negotiate a
      treaty, or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence,
      derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger,
      irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war. While
      they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians would
      evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid
      marches, passed the Alps and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities
      of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to
      his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty
      thousand auxiliaries; and, without meeting a single enemy in the
      field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected
      the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West. Instead of
      attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of
      the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the
      sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the
      ancient mistress of the world. An Italian hermit, whose zeal and
      sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves, encountered
      the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of
      Heaven against the oppressors of the earth; but the saint himself
      was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric, that he felt
      a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even
      compelled, his march to the gates of Rome. He felt, that his
      genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous
      enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the
      Goths, insensibly removed the popular, and almost superstitious,
      reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name. His
      troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of
      the Flaminian way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine,
      4 descended into the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay
      encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter
      and devour the milk-white oxen, which had been so long reserved
      for the use of Roman triumphs. A lofty situation, and a
      seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning, preserved the little
      city of Narni; but the king of the Goths, despising the ignoble
      prey, still advanced with unabated vigor; and after he had passed
      through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of Barbaric
      victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome. 6

      Baskerville) has given a very picturesque description of the road
      through the Apennine. The Goths were not at leisure to observe
      the beauties of the prospect; but they were pleased to find that
      the Saxa Intercisa, a narrow passage which Vespasian had cut
      through the rock, (Cluver. Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 168,) was
      totally neglected.

      the Clitumnus.]

      6 (return) [ Some ideas of the march of Alaric are borrowed from
      the journey of Honorius over the same ground. (See Claudian in

      and Rome was 254 Roman miles. Itinerar. Wesseling, p. 126.]

      During a period of six hundred and nineteen years, the seat of
      empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign
      enemy. The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal 7 served only to
      display the character of the senate and people; of a senate
      degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly
      of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus
      ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra. 8 Each of the
      senators, in the time of the Punic war, had accomplished his term
      of the military service, either in a subordinate or a superior
      station; and the decree, which invested with temporary command
      all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave
      the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and
      experienced generals. In the beginning of the war, the Roman
      people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an
      age to bear arms. 9 Fifty thousand had already died in the
      defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were
      employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia,
      Sicily, and Spain, required about one hundred thousand men. But
      there still remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent
      territory, who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and
      every citizen was trained, from his earliest youth, in the
      discipline and exercises of a soldier. Hannibal was astonished by
      the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of
      Capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his
      approach. He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance
      of three miles from the city; and he was soon informed, that the
      ground on which he had pitched his tent, was sold for an adequate
      price at a public auction; 911 and that a body of troops was
      dismissed by an opposite road, to reenforce the legions of Spain.
      10 He led his Africans to the gates of Rome, where he found three
      armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but Hannibal
      dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to
      escape, unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his
      speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.

      7 (return) [ The march and retreat of Hannibal are described by
      Livy, l. xxvi. c. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; and the reader is made a
      spectator of the interesting scene.]

      8 (return) [ These comparisons were used by Cyneas, the
      counsellor of Pyrrhus, after his return from his embassy, in

      9 (return) [ In the three census which were made of the Roman
      people, about the time of the second Punic war, the numbers stand

      37:) 270,213, 137,108 214,000. The fall of the second, and the
      rise of the third, appears so enormous, that several critics,
      notwithstanding the unanimity of the Mss., have suspected some
      corruption of the text of Livy. (See Drakenborch ad xxvii. 36,
      and Beaufort, Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 325.) They did not
      consider that the second census was taken only at Rome, and that
      the numbers were diminished, not only by the death, but likewise
      by the absence, of many soldiers. In the third census, Livy
      expressly affirms, that the legions were mustered by the care of
      particular commissaries. From the numbers on the list we must
      always deduct one twelfth above threescore, and incapable of
      bearing arms. See Population de la France, p. 72.]

      national pride.—M.]

      10 (return) [ Livy considers these two incidents as the effects
      only of chance and courage. I suspect that they were both managed
      by the admirable policy of the senate.]

      From the time of the Punic war, the uninterrupted succession of
      senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and
      the degenerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their
      descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal,
      and subdued the nations of the earth. The temporal honors which
      the devout Paula 11 inherited and despised, are carefully
      recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience, and the
      historian of her life. The genealogy of her father, Rogatus,
      which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a
      Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaesilla, numbered the Scipios,
      Aemilius Paulus, and the Gracchi, in the list of her ancestors;
      and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage
      from Aeneas, the father of the Julian line. The vanity of the
      rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty
      pretensions. Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they
      easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were
      countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name
      of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen
      and clients of illustrious families. Most of those families,
      however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or
      internal decay, were gradually extirpated; and it would be more
      reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations,
      among the mountains of the Alps, or in the peaceful solitude of
      Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of
      danger, and of perpetual revolutions. Under each successive
      reign, and from every province of the empire, a crowd of hardy
      adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices,
      usurped the wealth, the honors, and the palaces of Rome; and
      oppressed, or protected, the poor and humble remains of consular
      families; who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their
      ancestors. 12

      11 (return) [ See Jerom, tom. i. p. 169, 170, ad Eustochium; he
      bestows on Paula the splendid titles of Gracchorum stirps,
      soboles Scipionum, Pauli haeres, cujus vocabulum trahit, Martiae
      Papyriae Matris Africani vera et germana propago. This particular
      description supposes a more solid title than the surname of
      Julius, which Toxotius shared with a thousand families of the
      western provinces. See the Index of Tacitus, of Gruter’s
      Inscriptions, &c.]

      12 (return) [ Tacitus (Annal. iii. 55) affirms, that between the
      battle of Actium and the reign of Vespasian, the senate was
      gradually filled with new families from the Municipia and
      colonies of Italy.]

      In the time of Jerom and Claudian, the senators unanimously
      yielded the preeminence to the Anician line; and a slight view of
      their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of
      the noble families, which contended only for the second place. 13
      During the five first ages of the city, the name of the Anicians
      was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from
      Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long
      satisfied with the Plebeian honors of tribunes of the people. 14
      One hundred and sixty-eight years before the Christian era, the
      family was ennobled by the Prætorship of Anicius, who gloriously
      terminated the Illyrian war, by the conquest of the nation, and
      the captivity of their king. 15 From the triumph of that general,
      three consulships, in distant periods, mark the succession of the
      Anician name. 16 From the reign of Diocletian to the final
      extinction of the Western empire, that name shone with a lustre
      which was not eclipsed, in the public estimation, by the majesty
      of the Imperial purple. 17 The several branches, to whom it was
      communicated, united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and
      titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the Olybrian houses; and
      in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an
      hereditary claim. 18 The Anician family excelled in faith and in
      riches: they were the first of the Roman senate who embraced
      Christianity; and it is probable that Anicius Julian, who was
      afterwards consul and præfect of the city, atoned for his
      attachment to the party of Maxentius, by the readiness with which
      he accepted the religion of Constantine. 19 Their ample patrimony
      was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the Anician
      family; who shared with Gratian the honors of the consulship, and
      exercised, four times, the high office of Prætorian præfect. 20
      His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the
      Roman world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove
      the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and
      magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude
      of his clients, and the admiration of strangers. 21 Such was the
      respect entertained for his memory, that the two sons of Probus,
      in their earliest youth, and at the request of the senate, were
      associated in the consular dignity; a memorable distinction,
      without example, in the annals of Rome. 22

      Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By
      Barbarians.—Part II.

      “The marbles of the Anician palace,” were used as a proverbial
      expression of opulence and splendor; 23 but the nobles and
      senators of Rome aspired, in due gradation, to imitate that
      illustrious family. The accurate description of the city, which
      was composed in the Theodosian age, enumerates one thousand seven
      hundred and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honorable
      citizens. 24 Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse
      the exaggeration of the poet; that Rome contained a multitude of
      palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city: since it
      included within its own precincts every thing which could be
      subservient either to use or luxury; markets, hippodromes,
      temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial
      aviaries. 25 The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state
      of Rome when it was besieged by the Goths, 26 continues to
      observe, that several of the richest senators received from their
      estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold, above
      one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; without computing
      the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold,
      might have equalled in value one third of the money. Compared to
      this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thousand or
      fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more
      than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank, which
      required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind. Several
      examples are recorded, in the age of Honorius, of vain and
      popular nobles, who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a
      festival, which lasted seven days, and cost above one hundred
      thousand pounds sterling. 27 The estates of the Roman senators,
      which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth, were not
      confined to the limits of Italy. Their possessions extended far
      beyond the Ionian and Aegean Seas, to the most distant provinces:
      the city of Nicopolis, which Augustus had founded as an eternal
      monument of the Actian victory, was the property of the devout
      Paula; 28 and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers, which
      had divided hostile nations, now flowed through the lands of
      private citizens. 29 According to their temper and circumstances,
      the estates of the Romans were either cultivated by the labor of
      their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to
      the industrious farmer. The economical writers of antiquity
      strenuously recommend the former method, wherever it may be
      practicable; but if the object should be removed, by its distance
      or magnitude, from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer
      the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the
      soil, and interested in the produce, to the mercenary
      administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful, steward. 30

      The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited
      by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the
      occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure
      to the business and amusements of private life. At Rome, commerce
      was always held in contempt: but the senators, from the first age
      of the republic, increased their patrimony, and multiplied their
      clients, by the lucrative practice of usury; and the obselete
      laws were eluded, or violated, by the mutual inclinations and
      interest of both parties. 31 A considerable mass of treasure must
      always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the
      empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were
      many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid
      silver, than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished
      Carthage. 32 The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their
      fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of
      wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation. Their
      desires were continually gratified by the labor of a thousand
      hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were
      actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various
      professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully
      impelled by the hopes of gain. The ancients were destitute of
      many of the conveniences of life, which have been invented or
      improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and
      linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of
      Europe, than the senators of Rome could derive from all the
      refinements of pompous or sensual luxury. 33 Their luxury, and
      their manners, have been the subject of minute and laborious
      disposition: but as such inquiries would divert me too long from
      the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic
      state of Rome and its inhabitants, which is more peculiarly
      applicable to the period of the Gothic invasion. Ammianus
      Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the
      residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has
      mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation
      of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant. The
      judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of
      censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression;
      he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices, and personal
      resentments, which soured the temper of Ammianus himself; but he
      will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting
      and original picture of the manners of Rome. 34

      they were permitted to take six percent., or one half of the
      legal interest; and, what is more singular, this permission was
      granted to the young senators.]

      back. Under the lower empire, the use of linen and glass became
      somewhat more common. * Note: The discovery of glass in such
      common use at Pompeii, spoils the argument of Arbuthnot. See Sir
      W. Gell. Pompeiana, 2d ser. p. 98.—M.]

      “The greatness of Rome”—such is the language of the
      historian—“was founded on the rare, and almost incredible,
      alliance of virtue and of fortune. The long period of her infancy
      was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy,
      the neighbors and enemies of the rising city. In the strength and
      ardor of youth, she sustained the storms of war; carried her
      victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains; and brought
      home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe. At
      length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the
      terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and
      tranquillity. The venerable city, which had trampled on the necks
      of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the
      perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a
      wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favorite
      sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony. 35 A secure and
      profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of
      Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while Rome was
      still adored as the queen of the earth; and the subject nations
      still reverenced the name of the people, and the majesty of the
      senate. But this native splendor,” continues Ammianus, “is
      degraded, and sullied, by the conduct of some nobles, who,
      unmindful of their own dignity, and of that of their country,
      assume an unbounded license of vice and folly. They contend with
      each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames; and
      curiously select, or invent, the most lofty and sonorous
      appellations, Reburrus, or Fabunius, Pagonius, or Tarasius, 36
      which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and
      respect. From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they
      affect to multiply their likeness, in statues of bronze and
      marble; nor are they satisfied, unless those statues are covered
      with plates of gold; an honorable distinction, first granted to
      Acilius the consul, after he had subdued, by his arms and
      counsels, the power of King Antiochus. The ostentation of
      displaying, of magnifying, perhaps, the rent-roll of the estates
      which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the
      setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man, who
      recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were not
      distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy
      of their food, or the splendor of their apparel. But the modern
      nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the
      loftiness of their chariots, 37 and the weighty magnificence of
      their dress. Their long robes of silk and purple float in the
      wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they
      occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics,
      embroidered with the figures of various animals. 38 Followed by a
      train of fifty servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move
      along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they
      travelled with post-horses; and the example of the senators is
      boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered
      carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the
      city and suburbs. Whenever these persons of high distinction
      condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their
      entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to
      their own use the conveniences which were designed for the Roman
      people. If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they
      meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they
      express their affection by a tender embrace; while they proudly
      decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not
      permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands, or
      their knees. As soon as they have indulged themselves in the
      refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings, and the other
      ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of
      the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the
      garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till
      their departure the same haughty demeanor; which perhaps might
      have been excused in the great Marcellus, after the conquest of
      Syracuse. Sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more arduous
      achievements; they visit their estates in Italy, and procure
      themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the
      chase. 39 If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they
      have courage to sail, in their painted galleys, from the Lucrine
      Lake 40 to their elegant villas on the seacoast of Puteoli and
      Cayeta, 41 they compare their own expeditions to the marches of
      Caesar and Alexander. Yet should a fly presume to settle on the
      silken folds of their gilded umbrellas; should a sunbeam
      penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they
      deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament, in affected
      language, that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians,
      42 the regions of eternal darkness. In these journeys into the
      country, 43 the whole body of the household marches with their
      master. In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy
      and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are
      marshalled by the skill of their military leaders; so the
      domestic officers, who bear a rod, as an ensign of authority,
      distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and
      attendants. The baggage and wardrobe move in the front; and are
      immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior
      ministers, employed in the service of the kitchens, and of the
      table. The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of
      slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or
      dependent plebeians. The rear is closed by the favorite band of
      eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of
      seniority. Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of
      the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of
      Semiramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of frustrating
      the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of
      future generations. In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction, the
      nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal
      injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human
      species. When they have called for warm water, if a slave has
      been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with three
      hundred lashes: but should the same slave commit a wilful murder,
      the master will mildly observe, that he is a worthless fellow;
      but that, if he repeats the offence, he shall not escape
      punishment. Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans;
      and every stranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune,
      was relieved, or rewarded by their generosity. At present, if a
      foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one
      of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the
      first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind
      inquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his
      illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long
      delayed his journey to Rome, the active seat of manners, as well
      as of empire. Secure of a favorable reception, he repeats his
      visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery, that
      his person, his name, and his country, are already forgotten. If
      he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in
      the train of dependants, and obtains the permission to pay his
      assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable
      of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to remark his
      presence, his departure, or his return. Whenever the rich prepare
      a solemn and popular entertainment; 44 whenever they celebrate,
      with profuse and pernicious luxury, their private banquets; the
      choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation. The
      modest, the sober, and the learned, are seldom preferred; and the
      nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have
      the address to insert, in the list of invitations, the obscure
      names of the most worthless of mankind. But the frequent and
      familiar companions of the great, are those parasites, who
      practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who
      eagerly applaud each word, and every action, of their immortal
      patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated
      pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he
      is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit. At the
      Roman tables, the birds, the squirrels, 45 or the fish, which
      appear of an uncommon size, are contemplated with curious
      attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied, to ascertain
      their real weight; and, while the more rational guests are
      disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are
      summoned to attest, by an authentic record, the truth of such a
      marvelous event. Another method of introduction into the houses
      and society of the great, is derived from the profession of
      gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play. The
      confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of
      friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill
      in the Tesserarian art (which may be interpreted the game of dice
      and tables) 46 is a sure road to wealth and reputation. A master
      of that sublime science, who in a supper, or assembly, is placed
      below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and
      indignation which Cato might be supposed to feel, when he was
      refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people. The
      acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of nobles,
      who abhor the fatigue, and disdain the advantages, of study; and
      the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and
      the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus. 47 The
      libraries, which they have inherited from their fathers, are
      secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day. 48 But
      the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous
      lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and
      the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly
      repeated in the palaces of Rome. In those palaces, sound is
      preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the
      mind.”

      It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous
      suspicion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to
      excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the
      servants, who are despatched to make the decent inquiries, are
      not suffered to return home, till they have undergone the
      ceremony of a previous ablution. Yet this selfish and unmanly
      delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of
      avarice. The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator
      as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is
      subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and
      a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
      The art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament, and
      sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly
      understood; and it has happened, that in the same house, though
      in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable
      design of overreaching each other, have summoned their respective
      lawyers, to declare, at the same time, their mutual, but
      contradictory, intentions. The distress which follows and
      chastises extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the use
      of the most humiliating expedients. When they desire to borrow,
      they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the
      comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the
      royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules. If the
      demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant,
      instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the
      insolent creditor; who is seldom released from prison, till he
      has signed a discharge of the whole debt. These vices, which
      degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a
      puerile superstition, that disgraces their understanding. They
      listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who
      pretend to read, in the entrails of victims, the signs of future
      greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume
      either to bathe, or to dine, or to appear in public, till they
      have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology,
      the situation of Mercury, and the aspect of the moon. 49 It is
      singular enough, that this vain credulity may often be discovered
      among the profane sceptics, who impiously doubt, or deny, the
      existence of a celestial power.”

      Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By
      Barbarians.—Part III.

      In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and
      manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their
      subsistence from the dexterity or labor of their hands, are
      commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and, in that sense,
      the most respectable part of the community. But the plebeians of
      Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been
      oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and
      usury; and the husbandman, during the term of his military
      service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm. 50
      The lands of Italy which had been originally divided among the
      families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly
      purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age
      which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that
      only two thousand citizens were possessed of an independent
      substance. 51 Yet as long as the people bestowed, by their
      suffrages, the honors of the state, the command of the legions,
      and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious
      pride alleviated in some measure, the hardships of poverty; and
      their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality
      of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the
      thirty-five tribes, or the hundred and ninety-three centuries, of
      Rome. But when the prodigal commons had not only imprudently
      alienated the use, but the inheritance of power, they sunk, under
      the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace,
      which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished,
      if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of
      slaves, and the influx of strangers. As early as the time of
      Hadrian, it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives, that
      the capital had attracted the vices of the universe, and the
      manners of the most opposite nations. The intemperance of the
      Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy
      of the Egyptians and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics,
      and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were
      mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and
      false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their
      fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the
      precincts of the Eternal City. 52

      23) must have been frequently repeated in those primitive times,
      which have been so undeservedly praised.]

      to exaggerate, the misery of the common people.]

      Helv. c. 6) by the reflection, that a great part of mankind were
      in a state of exile, reminds her how few of the inhabitants of
      Rome were born in the city.]

      Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the
      frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged
      with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of
      crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of
      military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied
      to relieve the poverty, and to amuse the idleness, of an
      innumerable people. 53 I. For the convenience of the lazy
      plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into
      a daily allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were
      constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the
      appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket,
      ascended the flight of steps, which had been assigned to his
      peculiar quarter or division, and received, either as a gift, or
      at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of three
      pounds, for the use of his family. II. The forest of Lucania,
      whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, 54 afforded, as
      a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome
      meat. During five months of the year, a regular allowance of
      bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual
      consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined
      from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict from
      Valentinian the Third, at three millions six hundred and
      twenty-eight thousand pounds. 55 III. In the manners of
      antiquity, the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp, as well
      as for the bath; and the annual tax, which was imposed on Africa
      for the benefit of Rome, amounted to the weight of three millions
      of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of three hundred thousand
      English gallons. IV. The anxiety of Augustus to provide the
      metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn, was not extended
      beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the
      popular clamor accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a
      proclamation was issued, by the grave reformer, to remind his
      subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since
      the aqueducts of Agrippa had introduced into the city so many
      copious streams of pure and salubrious water. 56 This rigid
      sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous
      design of Aurelian 57 does not appear to have been executed in
      its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and
      liberal terms. The administration of the public cellars was
      delegated to a magistrate of honorable rank; and a considerable
      part of the vintage of Campania was reserved for the fortunate
      inhabitants of Rome.

      53 (return) [ Almost all that is said of the bread, bacon, oil,

      collateral testimonies are produced in Godefroy’s Commentary, and
      it is needless to transcribe them. According to a law of
      Theodosius, which appreciates in money the military allowance, a
      piece of gold (eleven shillings) was equivalent to eighty pounds
      of bacon, or to eighty pounds of oil, or to twelve modii (or
      pecks) of salt, (Cod. Theod. l. viii. tit. iv. leg. 17.) This
      equation, compared with another of seventy pounds of bacon for an

      The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of
      Augustus himself, replenished the Thermoe, or baths, which had
      been constructed in every part of the city, with Imperial
      magnificence. The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open,
      at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators
      and the people, contained above sixteen hundred seats of marble;
      and more than three thousand were reckoned in the baths of
      Diocletian. 58 The walls of the lofty apartments were covered
      with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the
      elegance of design, and the variety of colors. The Egyptian
      granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble
      of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the
      capacious basins, through so many wide mouths of bright and massy
      silver; and the meanest Roman could purchase, with a small copper
      coin, the daily enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury, which
      might excite the envy of the kings of Asia. 59 From these stately
      palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without
      shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the
      street of Forum, to hear news and to hold disputes; who
      dissipated in extravagant gaming, the miserable pittance of their
      wives and children; and spent the hours of the night in the
      obscure taverns, and brothels, in the indulgence of gross and
      vulgar sensuality. 60

      common people.]

      But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude,
      depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and
      spectacles. The piety of Christian princes had suppressed the
      inhuman combats of gladiators; but the Roman people still
      considered the Circus as their home, their temple, and the seat
      of the republic. The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to
      secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless
      and anxious night in the adjacent porticos. From the morning to
      the evening, careless of the sun, or of the rain, the spectators,
      who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred thousand,
      remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and
      charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear, for the
      success of the colors which they espoused: and the happiness of
      Rome appeared to hang on the event of a race. 61 The same
      immoderate ardor inspired their clamors and their applause, as
      often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts,
      and the various modes of theatrical representation. These
      representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered
      as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue. But
      the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired
      beyond the imitation of Attic genius, 62 had been almost totally
      silent since the fall of the republic; 63 and their place was
      unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and
      splendid pageantry. The pantomimes, 64 who maintained their
      reputation from the age of Augustus to the sixth century,
      expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the
      gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art,
      which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always
      excited the applause and wonder of the people. The vast and
      magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by three thousand female
      dancers, and by three thousand singers, with the masters of the
      respective choruses. Such was the popular favor which they
      enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were
      banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public
      pleasures exempted them from a law, which was strictly executed
      against the professors of the liberal arts. 65

      It is said, that the foolish curiosity of Elagabalus attempted to
      discover, from the quantity of spiders’ webs, the number of the
      inhabitants of Rome. A more rational method of inquiry might not
      have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who
      could easily have resolved a question so important for the Roman
      government, and so interesting to succeeding ages. The births and
      deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of
      antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the
      common average, we might now produce some satisfactory
      calculation, which would destroy the extravagant assertions of
      critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures
      of philosophers. 66 The most diligent researches have collected
      only the following circumstances; which, slight and imperfect as
      they are, may tend, in some degree, to illustrate the question of
      the populousness of ancient Rome. I. When the capital of the
      empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was
      accurately measured, by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it
      equal to twenty-one miles. 67 It should not be forgotten that the
      form of the city was almost that of a circle; the geometrical
      figure which is known to contain the largest space within any
      given circumference. II. The architect Vitruvius, who flourished
      in the Augustan age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has
      peculiar weight and authority, observes, that the innumerable
      habitations of the Roman people would have spread themselves far
      beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of
      ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens
      and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice
      of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air. 68 But
      the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty
      work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and
      fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as
      well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the
      walls of Rome, should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from
      the ground. 69 III. Juvenal 70 laments, as it should seem from
      his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom
      he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay,
      from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase, in the little
      towns of Italy, a cheerful commodious dwelling, at the same price
      which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
      House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at
      an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces
      and gardens; but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a
      narrow space; and the different floors, and apartments, of the
      same house, were divided, as it is still the custom of Paris, and
      other cities, among several families of plebeians. IV. The total
      number of houses in the fourteen regions of the city, is
      accurately stated in the description of Rome, composed under the
      reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight thousand
      three hundred and eighty-two. 71 The two classes of domus and of
      insulæ, into which they are divided, include all the habitations
      of the capital, of every rank and condition from the marble
      palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen
      and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodging-house, where the poet
      Codrus and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret
      immediately under the tiles. If we adopt the same average, which,
      under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,
      72 and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each
      house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of
      Rome at twelve hundred thousand: a number which cannot be thought
      excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds
      the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe. 73 7311

      7311 (return) [ M. Dureau de la Malle (Economic Politique des
      Romaines, t. i. p. 369) quotes a passage from the xvth chapter of
      Gibbon, in which he estimates the population of Rome at not less
      than a million, and adds (omitting any reference to this
      passage,) that he (Gibbon) could not have seriously studied the
      question. M. Dureau de la Malle proceeds to argue that Rome, as
      contained within the walls of Servius Tullius, occupying an area
      only one fifth of that of Paris, could not have contained 300,000
      inhabitants; within those of Aurelian not more than 560,000,
      inclusive of soldiers and strangers. The suburbs, he endeavors to
      show, both up to the time of Aurelian, and after his reign, were
      neither so extensive, nor so populous, as generally supposed. M.
      Dureau de la Malle has but imperfectly quoted the important
      passage of Dionysius, that which proves that when he wrote (in
      the time of Augustus) the walls of Servius no longer marked the
      boundary of the city. In many places they were so built upon,
      that it was impossible to trace them. There was no certain limit,
      where the city ended and ceased to be the city; it stretched out
      to so boundless an extent into the country. Ant. Rom. iv. 13.
      None of M. de la Malle’s arguments appear to me to prove, against
      this statement, that these irregular suburbs did not extend so
      far in many parts, as to make it impossible to calculate
      accurately the inhabited area of the city. Though no doubt the
      city, as reconstructed by Nero, was much less closely built and
      with many more open spaces for palaces, temples, and other public
      edifices, yet many passages seem to prove that the laws
      respecting the height of houses were not rigidly enforced. A
      great part of the lower especially of the slave population, were
      very densely crowded, and lived, even more than in our modern
      towns, in cellars and subterranean dwellings under the public
      edifices. Nor do M. de la Malle’s arguments, by which he would
      explain the insulae insulae (of which the Notitiae Urbis give us
      the number) as rows of shops, with a chamber or two within the
      domus, or houses of the wealthy, satisfy me as to their soundness
      of their scholarship. Some passages which he adduces directly
      contradict his theory; none, as appears to me, distinctly prove
      it. I must adhere to the old interpretation of the word, as
      chiefly dwellings for the middling or lower classes, or clusters
      of tenements, often perhaps, under the same roof. On this point,
      Zumpt, in the Dissertation before quoted, entirely disagrees with
      M. de la Malle. Zumpt has likewise detected the mistake of M. de
      la Malle as to the “canon” of corn, mentioned in the life of
      Septimius Severus by Spartianus. On this canon the French writer
      calculates the inhabitants of Rome at that time. But the “canon”
      was not the whole supply of Rome, but that quantity which the
      state required for the public granaries to supply the gratuitous
      distributions to the people, and the public officers and slaves;
      no doubt likewise to keep down the general price. M. Zumpt
      reckons the population of Rome at 2,000,000. After careful
      consideration, I should conceive the number in the text,
      1,200,000, to be nearest the truth—M. 1845.]

      Such was the state of Rome under the reign of Honorius; at the
      time when the Gothic army formed the siege, or rather the
      blockade, of the city. 74 By a skilful disposition of his
      numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an
      assault, Alaric encompassed the walls, commanded the twelve
      principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent
      country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tyber, from
      which the Romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of
      provisions. The first emotions of the nobles, and of the people,
      were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile Barbarian
      should dare to insult the capital of the world: but their
      arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage,
      instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly
      exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim. Perhaps in the
      person of Serena, the Romans might have respected the niece of
      Theodosius, the aunt, nay, even the adoptive mother, of the
      reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and
      they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny,
      which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal
      correspondence with the Gothic invader. Actuated, or overawed, by
      the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any
      evidence of his guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
      Serena was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude
      were astonished to find, that this cruel act of injustice did not
      immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians, and the
      deliverance of the city. That unfortunate city gradually
      experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid
      calamities of famine. The daily allowance of three pounds of
      bread was reduced to one half, to one third, to nothing; and the
      price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant
      proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase the
      necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the
      rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the
      humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had
      fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated to the use of the
      indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from
      the grateful successors of her husband. 75 But these private and
      temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a
      numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble
      palaces of the senators themselves. The persons of both sexes,
      who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury,
      discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of
      nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and
      silver, to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they
      would formerly have rejected with disdain. The food the most
      repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most
      unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly
      devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger. A dark
      suspicion was entertained, that some desperate wretches fed on
      the bodies of their fellow-creatures, whom they had secretly
      murdered; and even mothers, (such was the horrid conflict of the
      two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human
      breast,) even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their
      slaughtered infants! 76 Many thousands of the inhabitants of Rome
      expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of
      sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were
      in the power of the enemy the stench, which arose from so many
      putrid and unburied carcasses, infected the air; and the miseries
      of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a
      pestilential disease. The assurances of speedy and effectual
      relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of
      Ravenna, supported for some time, the fainting resolution of the
      Romans, till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them
      to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance. Pompeianus,
      præfect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or
      fanaticism of some Tuscan diviners, that, by the mysterious force
      of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from
      the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of
      the Barbarians. 77 The important secret was communicated to
      Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St. Peter is
      accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of
      the republic to the rigid severity of the Christian worship. But
      when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was
      proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should
      be performed in the Capitol, by the authority, and in the
      presence, of the magistrates, the majority of that respectable
      assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the Imperial
      displeasure, refused to join in an act, which appeared almost
      equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism. 78

      The last resource of the Romans was in the clemency, or at least
      in the moderation, of the king of the Goths. The senate, who in
      this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government,
      appointed two ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy. This
      important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator, of Spanish
      extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of
      provinces; and to John, the first tribune of the notaries, who
      was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well
      as by his former intimacy with the Gothic prince. When they were
      introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more
      lofty style than became their abject condition, that the Romans
      were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war;
      and that, if Alaric refused them a fair and honorable
      capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give
      battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms, and animated
      by despair. “The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed,” was
      the concise reply of the Barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was
      accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his
      contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by
      luxury before they were emaciated by famine. He then condescended
      to fix the ransom, which he would accept as the price of his
      retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the
      city, whether it were the property of the state, or of
      individuals; all the rich and precious movables; and all the
      slaves that could prove their title to the name of Barbarians.
      The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and
      suppliant tone, “If such, O king, are your demands, what do you
      intend to leave us?” “Your Lives!” replied the haughty conqueror:
      they trembled, and retired. Yet, before they retired, a short
      suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a
      more temperate negotiation. The stern features of Alaric were
      insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigor of his terms; and
      at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment
      of five thousand pounds of gold, of thirty thousand pounds of
      silver, of four thousand robes of silk, of three thousand pieces
      of fine scarlet cloth, and of three thousand pounds weight of
      pepper. 79 But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual
      rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces, had been
      exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the
      hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of
      avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only
      resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city. As soon
      as the Romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they
      were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and
      plenty. Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the
      importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country
      was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in
      crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in
      the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful
      trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the
      city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in
      the public and private granaries. A more regular discipline than
      could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric;
      and the wise Barbarian justified his regard for the faith of
      treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of
      licentious Goths, who had insulted some Roman citizens on the
      road to Ostia. His army, enriched by the contributions of the
      capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of
      Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter quarters; and
      the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian
      slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the
      command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the
      disgrace of their cruel servitude. About the same time, he
      received a more honorable reenforcement of Goths and Huns, whom
      Adolphus, 80 the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his
      pressing invitation, from the banks of the Danube to those of the
      Tyber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss,
      through the superior number of the Imperial troops. A victorious
      leader, who united the daring spirit of a Barbarian with the art
      and discipline of a Roman general, was at the head of a hundred
      thousand fighting men; and Italy pronounced, with terror and
      respect, the formidable name of Alaric. 81

      In the midst of his apparent prosperity, Alaric was conscious,
      perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or
      perhaps the moderation which he displayed, was intended only to
      deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of
      Honorius. The king of the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was
      his desire to be considered as the friend of peace, and of the
      Romans. Three senators, at his earnest request, were sent
      ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of
      hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals,
      which he more clearly expressed during the course of the
      negotiations, could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as
      they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. The
      Barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the
      armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and
      money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and
      Venetia, for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have
      commanded the important communication between Italy and the
      Danube. If these modest terms should be rejected, Alaric showed a
      disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to
      content himself with the possession of Noricum; an exhausted and
      impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the
      Barbarians of Germany. 82 But the hopes of peace were
      disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the
      minister Olympius. Without listening to the salutary
      remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under
      the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of
      honor, and too feeble for any army of defence. Six thousand
      Dalmatians, the flower of the Imperial legions, were ordered to
      march from Ravenna to Rome, through an open country which was
      occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians. These brave
      legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to
      ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with a hundred
      soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and one of the
      ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law
      of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of
      thirty thousand pieces of gold. Yet Alaric, instead of resenting
      this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals
      of peace; and the second embassy of the Roman senate, which
      derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop
      of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a
      detachment of Gothic soldiers. 83

      Olympius 84 might have continued to insult the just resentment of
      a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public
      calamities; but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues
      of the palace. The favorite eunuchs transferred the government of
      Honorius, and the empire, to Jovius, the Prætorian præfect; an
      unworthy servant, who did not atone, by the merit of personal
      attachment, for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
      The exile, or escape, of the guilty Olympius, reserved him for
      more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an
      obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a
      second time into disgrace; his ears were cut off; he expired
      under the lash; and his ignominious death afforded a grateful
      spectacle to the friends of Stilicho. After the removal of
      Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious
      fanaticism, the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the
      impolitic proscription, which excluded them from the dignities of
      the state. The brave Gennerid, 85 a soldier of Barbarian origin,
      who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been
      obliged to lay aside the military belt: and though he was
      repeatedly assured by the emperor himself, that laws were not
      made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any
      partial dispensation, and persevered in honorable disgrace, till
      he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the
      Roman government. The conduct of Gennerid in the important
      station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general
      of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the
      discipline and spirit of the republic. From a life of idleness
      and want, his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and
      plentiful subsistence; and his private generosity often supplied
      the rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the
      court of Ravenna. The valor of Gennerid, formidable to the
      adjacent Barbarians, was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian
      frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a
      reenforcement of ten thousand Huns, who arrived on the confines
      of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a
      numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient,
      not only for the march of an army, but for the settlement of a
      colony. But the court and councils of Honorius still remained a
      scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
      Instigated by the præfect Jovius, the guards rose in furious
      mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two
      principal eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promise of
      safety, were sent on shipboard, and privately executed; while the
      favor of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at
      Milan and Constantinople. Eusebius the eunuch, and the Barbarian
      Allobich, succeeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the
      guards; and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers
      was the cause of their mutual destruction. By the insolent order
      of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was
      shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes of the
      astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich,
      in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of
      his life, in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of
      courage or resentment. Yet before they fell, Eusebius and
      Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by
      opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish,
      and perhaps a criminal, motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a
      personal interview under the walls of Rimini. During the absence
      of Jovius, the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of
      inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation, nor his
      character, could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with
      the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the
      Prætorian præfect, granting him a free permission to dispose of
      the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military
      honors of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter
      was imprudently communicated to Alaric himself; and the Goth, who
      in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency,
      expressed, in the most outrageous language, his lively sense of
      the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
      The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted; and the
      præfect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to
      adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the
      court. By his advice and example, the principal officers of the
      state and army were obliged to swear, that, without listening, in
      any circumstances, to any conditions of peace, they would still
      persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of
      the republic. This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to
      all future negotiation. The ministers of Honorius were heard to
      declare, that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity,
      they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to
      the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the
      emperor himself; they had touched, in solemn ceremony, that
      august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their
      oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and
      rebellion. 86

      the Caesars; and Tertullian complains, that it was the only oath
      which the Romans of his time affected to reverence. See an

      Ancients, in the Mem de l’Academie des Inscriptions, tom. i. p.

      While the emperor and his court enjoyed, with sullen pride, the
      security of the marches and fortifications of Ravenna, they
      abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of
      Alaric. Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or
      affected, that, as he moved with his army along the Flaminian
      way, he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of Italy
      to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the
      emperor, that he would save the city and its inhabitants from
      hostile fire, and the sword of the Barbarians. 87 These impending
      calamities were, however, averted, not indeed by the wisdom of
      Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the Gothic king; who
      employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
      Instead of assaulting the capital, he successfully directed his
      efforts against the Port of Ostia, one of the boldest and most
      stupendous works of Roman magnificence. 88 The accidents to which
      the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in
      a winter navigation, and an open road, had suggested to the
      genius of the first Caesar the useful design, which was executed
      under the reign of Claudius. The artificial moles, which formed
      the narrow entrance, advanced far into the sea, and firmly
      repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels
      securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basins,
      which received the northern branch of the Tyber, about two miles
      from the ancient colony of Ostia. 89 The Roman Port insensibly
      swelled to the size of an episcopal city, 90 where the corn of
      Africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the
      capital. As soon as Alaric was in possession of that important
      place, he summoned the city to surrender at discretion; and his
      demands were enforced by the positive declaration, that a
      refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the
      destruction of the magazines, on which the life of the Roman
      people depended. The clamors of that people, and the terror of
      famine, subdued the pride of the senate; they listened, without
      reluctance, to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the
      throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the Gothic
      conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, præfect of the city.
      The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as
      master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank
      of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of
      Attalus; and the two hostile nations seemed to be united in the
      closest bands of friendship and alliance. 91

      triangle, whose sides were each of them computed at about two
      miles. The colony of Ostia was founded immediately beyond the
      left, or southern, and the Port immediately beyond the right, or
      northern, branch of hte river; and the distance between their
      remains measures something more than two miles on Cingolani’s

      Tyber had choked the harbor of Ostia; the progress of the same

      The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of
      the Romans, encompassed on every side by the Gothic arms, was
      conducted, in tumultuous procession, to the palace of Augustus
      and Trajan. After he had distributed the civil and military
      dignities among his favorites and followers, Attalus convened an
      assembly of the senate; before whom, in a formal and florid
      speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of
      the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of Egypt
      and the East, which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of
      Rome. Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen
      with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper,
      whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which
      the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the
      Barbarians. But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded
      the change of masters. The public discontent was favorable to the
      rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his
      persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at
      least of toleration, from a prince, who, in his native country of
      Ionia, had been educated in the Pagan superstition, and who had
      since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an
      Arian bishop. 92 The first days of the reign of Attalus were fair
      and prosperous. An officer of confidence was sent with an
      inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa;
      the greatest part of Italy submitted to the terror of the Gothic
      powers; and though the city of Bologna made a vigorous and
      effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps
      with the absence of Honorius, accepted, with loud acclamations,
      the choice of the Roman senate. At the head of a formidable army,
      Alaric conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of
      Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers, of
      Jovius, the Prætorian præfect, of Valens, master of the cavalry
      and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the first
      of the notaries, was introduced, with martial pomp, into the
      Gothic camp. In the name of their sovereign, they consented to
      acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide
      the provinces of Italy and the West between the two emperors.
      Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was
      aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended
      to promise, that, if Honorius would instantly resign the purple,
      he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the
      peaceful exile of some remote island. 93 So desperate indeed did
      the situation of the son of Theodosius appear, to those who were
      the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that Jovius
      and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust,
      infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and
      devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more
      fortunate rival. Astonished by such examples of domestic treason,
      Honorius trembled at the approach of every servant, at the
      arrival of every messenger. He dreaded the secret enemies, who
      might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bed-chamber; and some
      ships lay ready in the harbor of Ravenna, to transport the
      abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the
      emperor of the East.

      92 (return) [ We may admit the evidence of Sozomen for the Arian
      baptism, and that of Philostorgius for the Pagan education, of
      Attalus. The visible joy of Zosimus, and the discontent which he
      imputes to the Anician family, are very unfavorable to the
      Christianity of the new emperor.]

      93 (return) [ He carried his insolence so far, as to declare that
      he should mutilate Honorius before he sent him into exile. But
      this assertion of Zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial
      testimony of Olympiodorus; who attributes the ungenerous proposal
      (which was absolutely rejected by Attalus) to the baseness, and
      perhaps the treachery, of Jovius.]

      But there is a Providence (such at least was the opinion of the
      historian Procopius) 94 that watches over innocence and folly;
      and the pretensions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot
      reasonably be disputed. At the moment when his despair, incapable
      of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a
      seasonable reenforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly
      landed in the port of Ravenna. To these valiant strangers, whose
      fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he
      committed the walls and gates of the city; and the slumbers of
      the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of
      imminent and internal danger. The favorable intelligence which
      was received from Africa suddenly changed the opinions of men,
      and the state of public affairs. The troops and officers, whom
      Attalus had sent into that province, were defeated and slain; and
      the active zeal of Heraclian maintained his own allegiance, and
      that of his people. The faithful count of Africa transmitted a
      large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the Imperial
      guards; and his vigilance, in preventing the exportation of corn
      and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent, into the
      walls of Rome. The failure of the African expedition was the
      source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of
      Attalus; and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated
      from the interest of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or
      docility to obey. The most imprudent measures were adopted,
      without the knowledge, or against the advice, of Alaric; and the
      obstinate refusal of the senate, to allow, in the embarkation,
      the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed a suspicious and
      distrustful temper, which, in their situation, was neither
      generous nor prudent. The resentment of the Gothic king was
      exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised
      to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double
      perfidy, by declaring, without a blush, that he had only seemed
      to abandon the service of Honorius, more effectually to ruin the
      cause of the usurper. In a large plain near Rimini, and in the
      presence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians,
      the wretched Attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and
      purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by Alaric, as the
      pledge of peace and friendship, to the son of Theodosius. 95 The
      officers who returned to their duty, were reinstated in their
      employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was
      graciously allowed; but the degraded emperor of the Romans,
      desirous of life, and insensible of disgrace, implored the
      permission of following the Gothic camp, in the train of a
      haughty and capricious Barbarian. 96

      The degradation of Attalus removed the only real obstacle to the
      conclusion of the peace; and Alaric advanced within three miles
      of Ravenna, to press the irresolution of the Imperial ministers,
      whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune. His
      indignation was kindled by the report, that a rival chieftain,
      that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary
      foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace. At
      the head of three hundred followers, that fearless Barbarian
      immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna; surprised, and cut
      in pieces, a considerable body of Goths; reentered the city in
      triumph; and was permitted to insult his adversary, by the voice
      of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of Alaric had
      forever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the
      emperor. 97 The crime and folly of the court of Ravenna was

      revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the
      trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared, by a
      desperate resistance, to defray the ruin of their country. But
      they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their
      slaves and domestics; who, either from birth or interest, were
      attached to the cause of the enemy. At the hour of midnight, the
      Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were
      awakened by the tremendous sound of the Gothic trumpet. Eleven
      hundred and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the
      Imperial city, which had subdued and civilized so considerable a
      part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the
      tribes of Germany and Scythia. 98

      The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a
      vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of
      humanity and religion. He encouraged his troops boldly to seize
      the rewards of valor, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of
      a wealthy and effeminate people: but he exhorted them, at the
      same time, to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to
      respect the churches of the apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, as
      holy and inviolable sanctuaries. Amidst the horrors of a
      nocturnal tumult, several of the Christian Goths displayed the
      fervor of a recent conversion; and some instances of their
      uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned,
      by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers. 99 While the Barbarians
      roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of
      an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the
      altar, was forced open by one of the powerful Goths. He
      immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and
      silver in her possession; and was astonished at the readiness
      with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate,
      of the richest materials, and the most curious workmanship. The
      Barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable
      acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition,
      addressed to him in the following words: “These,” said she, “are
      the consecrated vessels belonging to St. Peter: if you presume to
      touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
      For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.” The
      Gothic captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a
      messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had
      discovered; and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all
      the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported,
      without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle. From the
      extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill, to the distant quarter
      of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order
      of battle through the principal streets, protected, with
      glittering arms, the long train of their devout companions, who
      bore aloft, on their heads, the sacred vessels of gold and
      silver; and the martial shouts of the Barbarians were mingled
      with the sound of religious psalmody. From all the adjacent
      houses, a crowd of Christians hastened to join this edifying
      procession; and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of
      age, or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to
      the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican. The learned
      work, concerning the City of God, was professedly composed by St.
      Augustin, to justify the ways of Providence in the destruction of
      the Roman greatness. He celebrates, with peculiar satisfaction,
      this memorable triumph of Christ; and insults his adversaries, by
      challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken
      by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able
      to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries. 100

      were both attached to the Gothic cause, have repeated and
      embellished these edifying tales. According to Isidore, Alaric
      himself was heard to say, that he waged war with the Romans, and
      not with the apostles. Such was the style of the seventh century;
      two hundred years before, the fame and merit had been ascribed,
      not to the apostles, but to Christ.]

      In the sack of Rome, some rare and extraordinary examples of
      Barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded. But the holy
      precincts of the Vatican, and the apostolic churches, could
      receive a very small proportion of the Roman people; many
      thousand warriors, more especially of the Huns, who served under
      the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least
      to the faith, of Christ; and we may suspect, without any breach
      of charity or candor, that in the hour of savage license, when
      every passion was inflamed, and every restraint was removed, the
      precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behavior of the
      Gothic Christians. The writers, the best disposed to exaggerate
      their clemency, have freely confessed, that a cruel slaughter was
      made of the Romans; 101 and that the streets of the city were
      filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the
      general consternation. The despair of the citizens was sometimes
      converted into fury: and whenever the Barbarians were provoked by
      opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble,
      the innocent, and the helpless. The private revenge of forty
      thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the
      ignominious lashes, which they had formerly received, were washed
      away in the blood of the guilty, or obnoxious, families. The
      matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to injuries more
      dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and
      the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female
      virtue, for the admiration of future ages. 102 A Roman lady, of
      singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient
      desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark
      of Sozomen, was attached to the Arian heresy. Exasperated by her
      obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a
      lover, slightly wounded her neck. The bleeding heroine still
      continued to brave his resentment, and to repel his love, till
      the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully
      conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave six
      pieces of gold to the guards of the church, on condition that
      they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
      Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely
      common. The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites,
      without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their
      female captives: and a nice question of casuistry was seriously
      agitated, Whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly
      refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had
      lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity. 103
      Their were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind, and
      more general concern. It cannot be presumed, that all the
      Barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous
      outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity,
      protected the greatest part of the Roman women from the danger of
      a rape. But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since
      the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to
      the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by
      the possession of wealth. In the pillage of Rome, a just
      preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the
      greatest value in the smallest compass and weight: but, after
      these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent
      robbers, the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their
      splendid and costly furniture. The sideboards of massy plate, and
      the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly
      piled in the wagons, that always followed the march of a Gothic
      army. The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled, or
      wantonly destroyed; many a statue was melted for the sake of the
      precious materials; and many a vase, in the division of the
      spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battle-axe.

      The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of
      the rapacious Barbarians, who proceeded, by threats, by blows,
      and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of
      hidden treasure. 104 Visible splendor and expense were alleged as
      the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was
      imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some
      misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would
      discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many
      unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash, for refusing to
      reveal their imaginary treasures. The edifices of Rome, though
      the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from
      the violence of the Goths. At their entrance through the Salarian
      gate, they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march, and to
      distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which
      encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed
      many private and public buildings; and the ruins of the palace of
      Sallust 105 remained, in the age of Justinian, a stately monument
      of the Gothic conflagration. 106 Yet a contemporary historian has
      observed, that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of
      solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to
      subvert the foundations of ancient structures. Some truth may
      possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of
      Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage; and that the
      proud Forum of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods
      and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.

      Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By
      Barbarians.—Part V.

      Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank, who
      perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that
      only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy. 108 But
      it was not easy to compute the multitudes, who, from an honorable
      station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the
      miserable condition of captives and exiles. As the Barbarians had
      more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate
      price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom
      was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the
      charity of strangers. 109 The captives, who were regularly sold,
      either in open market, or by private contract, would have legally
      regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a
      citizen to lose, or to alienate. 110 But as it was soon
      discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger
      their lives; and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to
      sell, might be provoked to murder, their useless prisoners; the
      civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise
      regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate
      term of five years, till they had discharged by their labor the
      price of their redemption. 111 The nations who invaded the Roman
      empire, had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of
      hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude
      than of famine. The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the
      inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant
      places of refuge. While the Gothic cavalry spread terror and
      desolation along the sea-coast of Campania and Tuscany, the
      little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the
      Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile
      attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of
      citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that
      sequestered spot. 112 The ample patrimonies, which many
      senatorian families possessed in Africa, invited them, if they
      had time, and prudence, to escape from the ruin of their country,
      to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province. The most
      illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba, 113
      the widow of the præfect Petronius. After the death of her
      husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at
      the head of the Anician family, and successively supplied, from
      her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her three
      sons. When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, Proba
      supported, with Christian resignation, the loss of immense
      riches; embarked in a small vessel, from whence she beheld, at
      sea, the flames of her burning palace, and fled with her daughter
      Laeta, and her granddaughter, the celebrated virgin, Demetrias,
      to the coast of Africa. The benevolent profusion with which the
      matron distributed the fruits, or the price, of her estates,
      contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
      But even the family of Proba herself was not exempt from the
      rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in
      matrimonial prostitution, the noblest maidens of Rome to the lust
      or avarice of the Syrian merchants. The Italian fugitives were
      dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of Egypt and
      Asia, as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem; and the village of
      Bethlem, the solitary residence of St. Jerom and his female
      converts, was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex, and
      every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance
      of their past fortune. 114 This awful catastrophe of Rome filled
      the astonished empire with grief and terror. So interesting a
      contrast of greatness and ruin, disposed the fond credulity of
      the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of
      the queen of cities. The clergy, who applied to recent events the
      lofty metaphors of oriental prophecy, were sometimes tempted to
      confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of
      the globe.

      There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate
      the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
      Yet, when the first emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate
      was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious
      contemporaries were forced to confess, that infant Rome had
      formerly received more essential injury from the Gauls, than she
      had now sustained from the Goths in her declining age. 115 The
      experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a
      much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that
      the ravages of the Barbarians, whom Alaric had led from the banks
      of the Danube, were less destructive than the hostilities
      exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a Catholic prince,
      who styled himself Emperor of the Romans. 116 The Goths evacuated
      the city at the end of six days, but Rome remained above nine
      months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was
      stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine. The
      authority of Alaric preserved some order and moderation among the
      ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and
      king; but the constable of Bourbon had gloriously fallen in the
      attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every
      restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of three
      independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the
      Germans. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the manners
      of Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of
      mankind. They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an
      unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring
      from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who
      had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to
      assault the palace of the Roman pontiff, must deserve to be
      considered as the most profligate of the Italians. At the same
      era, the Spaniards were the terror both of the Old and New
      World: but their high-spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy
      pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty. Indefatigable
      in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated
      practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing
      their prisoners: many of the Castilians, who pillaged Rome, were
      familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps,
      were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico. The Germans were
      less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards;
      and the rustic, or even savage, aspect of those Tramontane
      warriors, often disguised a simple and merciful disposition. But
      they had imbibed, in the first fervor of the reformation, the
      spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther. It was their
      favorite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects
      of Catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse,
      a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and
      degree, who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of
      modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the
      throne of Anti-christ, to purify, with blood and fire, the
      abominations of the spiritual Babylon. 117

      The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated Rome on the
      sixth day, 118 might be the result of prudence; but it was not
      surely the effect of fear. 119 At the head of an army encumbered
      with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced
      along the Appian way into the southern provinces of Italy,
      destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting
      himself with the plunder of the unresisting country. The fate of
      Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which
      was respected, even in its decay, as the eighth city of the
      empire, 120 is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of
      Nola 121 has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity
      of Paulinus, 122 who was successively a consul, a monk, and a
      bishop. At the age of forty, he renounced the enjoyment of wealth
      and honor, of society and literature, to embrace a life of
      solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy
      encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends,
      who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or
      body. 123 An early and passionate attachment determined him to
      fix his humble dwelling in one of the suburbs of Nola, near the
      miraculous tomb of St. Faelix, which the public devotion had
      already surrounded with five large and populous churches. The
      remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated
      to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day
      of his festival, Paulinus never failed to celebrate by a solemn
      hymn; and in whose name he erected a sixth church, of superior
      elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious
      pictures, from the history of the Old and New Testament. Such
      assiduous zeal secured the favor of the saint, 124 or at least of
      the people; and, after fifteen years’ retirement, the Roman
      consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few
      months before the city was invested by the Goths. During the
      siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen,
      either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar
      patron; yet it soon appeared by the event, that Faelix wanted
      power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had
      formerly been the shepherd. Nola was not saved from the general
      devastation; 125 and the captive bishop was protected only by the
      general opinion of his innocence and poverty. Above four years
      elapsed from the successful invasion of Italy by the arms of
      Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the Goths under the conduct
      of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they
      reigned without control over a country, which, in the opinion of
      the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature
      and art. The prosperity, indeed, which Italy had attained in the
      auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the
      decline of the empire.

      The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the
      Barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the
      more elegant refinements of luxury, which had been prepared for
      the use of the soft and polished Italians. Each soldier, however,
      claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and
      cattle, oil and wine, that was daily collected and consumed in
      the Gothic camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas
      and gardens, once inhabited by Lucullus and Cicero, along the
      beauteous coast of Campania. Their trembling captives, the sons
      and daughters of Roman senators, presented, in goblets of gold
      and gems, large draughts of Falernian wine to the haughty
      victors; who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of
      plane-trees, 126 artificially disposed to exclude the scorching
      rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun. These delights
      were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of
      their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the
      frozen banks of the Elbe and Danube, added new charms to the
      felicity of the Italian climate. 127

      Whether fame, or conquest, or riches, were the object or Alaric,
      he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardor, which could
      neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success. No
      sooner had he reached the extreme land of Italy, than he was
      attracted by the neighboring prospect of a fertile and peaceful
      island. Yet even the possession of Sicily he considered only as
      an intermediate step to the important expedition, which he
      already meditated against the continent of Africa. The Straits of
      Rhegium and Messina 128 are twelve miles in length, and, in the
      narrowest passage, about one mile and a half broad; and the
      fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of Scylla, and the
      whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and
      unskilful mariners. Yet as soon as the first division of the
      Goths had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk, or
      scattered, many of the transports; their courage was daunted by
      the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated
      by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short
      illness, the fatal term of his conquests. The ferocious character
      of the Barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose
      valor and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause. By the
      labor of a captive multitude, they forcibly diverted the course
      of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of
      Consentia. The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils

      Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By
      Barbarians.—Part VI.

      The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the Barbarians
      were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the
      brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarch, was
      unanimously elected to succeed to his throne. The character and
      political system of the new king of the Goths may be best
      understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen
      of Narbonne; who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
      related it to St. Jerom, in the presence of the historian
      Orosius. “In the full confidence of valor and victory, I once
      aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to
      obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion
      of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of
      the founder of a new empire. By repeated experiments, I was
      gradually convinced, that laws are essentially necessary to
      maintain and regulate a well-constituted state; and that the
      fierce, untractable humor of the Goths was incapable of bearing
      the salutary yoke of laws and civil government. From that moment
      I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition;
      and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages
      should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the
      sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain,
      the prosperity of the Roman empire.” 130 With these pacific
      views, the successor of Alaric suspended the operations of war;
      and seriously negotiated with the Imperial court a treaty of
      friendship and alliance. It was the interest of the ministers of
      Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their
      extravagant oath, to deliver Italy from the intolerable weight of
      the Gothic powers; and they readily accepted their service
      against the tyrants and Barbarians who infested the provinces
      beyond the Alps. 131 Adolphus, assuming the character of a Roman
      general, directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the
      southern provinces of Gaul. His troops, either by force or
      agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne,
      Thoulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count
      Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their
      quarters from the Mediterranean to the Ocean.

      The oppressed provincials might exclaim, that the miserable
      remnant, which the enemy had spared, was cruelly ravished by
      their pretended allies; yet some specious colors were not wanting
      to palliate, or justify the violence of the Goths. The cities of
      Gaul, which they attacked, might perhaps be considered as in a
      state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the
      articles of the treaty, or the secret instructions of the court,
      might sometimes be alleged in favor of the seeming usurpations of
      Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular, unsuccessful act of
      hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth,
      to the ungovernable spirit of a Barbarian host, impatient of
      peace or discipline. The luxury of Italy had been less effectual
      to soften the temper, than to relax the courage, of the Goths;
      and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and
      institutions, of civilized society. 132

      131 (return) [ Jornandes supposes, without much probability, that
      Adolphus visited and plundered Rome a second time, (more
      locustarum erasit) Yet he agrees with Orosius in supposing that a
      treaty of peace was concluded between the Gothic prince and
      Honorius. See Oros. l. vii. c. 43 p. 584, 585. Jornandes, de Reb.
      Geticis, c. 31, p. 654, 655.]

      first transactions in Gaul, are dark and doubtful. I have derived
      much assistance from Mascou, (Hist. of the Ancient Germans, l.
      viii. c. 29, 35, 36, 37,) who has illustrated, and connected, the
      broken chronicles and fragments of the times.]

      The professions of Adolphus were probably sincere, and his
      attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the
      ascendant which a Roman princess had acquired over the heart and
      understanding of the Barbarian king. Placidia, 133 the daughter
      of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his second wife, had
      received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but
      the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions
      which agitated the Western empire under the reign of her brother
      Honorius. When Rome was first invested by the arms of Alaric,
      Placidia, who was then about twenty years of age, resided in the
      city; and her ready consent to the death of her cousin Serena has
      a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the
      circumstances of the action, may be aggravated, or excused, by
      the consideration of her tender age. 134 The victorious
      Barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive, 135 the
      sister of Honorius; but, while she was exposed to the disgrace of
      following round Italy the motions of a Gothic camp, she
      experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment. The
      authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may
      perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive
      silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendor of her birth, the
      bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous
      insinuation which she condescended to employ, made a deep
      impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the Gothic king aspired
      to call himself the brother of the emperor. The ministers of
      Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so
      injurious to every sentiment of Roman pride; and repeatedly urged
      the restitution of Placidia, as an indispensable condition of the
      treaty of peace. But the daughter of Theodosius submitted,
      without reluctance, to the desires of the conqueror, a young and
      valiant prince, who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature,
      but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and
      beauty. The marriage of Adolphus and Placidia 136 was consummated
      before the Goths retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the
      anniversary day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in
      the house of Ingenuus, one of the most illustrious citizens of
      Narbonne in Gaul. The bride, attired and adorned like a Roman
      empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the
      Goths, who assumed, on this occasion, the Roman habit, contented
      himself with a less honorable seat by her side. The nuptial gift,
      which, according to the custom of his nation, 137 was offered to
      Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her
      country. Fifty beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin
      in each hand; and one of these basins was filled with pieces of
      gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
      Attalus, so long the sport of fortune, and of the Goths, was
      appointed to lead the chorus of the Hymeneal song; and the
      degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful
      musician. The Barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph;
      and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by
      the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their
      Gothic lord. 138

      century, by the Franks: sixty cups, or chalices; fifteen patens,
      or plates, for the use of the communion; twenty boxes, or cases,
      to hold the books of the Gospels: this consecrated wealth 139 was
      distributed by the son of Clovis among the churches of his
      dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former
      sacrilege of the Goths. They possessed, with more security of
      conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service
      of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of five hundred
      pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the
      exquisite workmanship, and the tradition, that it had been
      presented by Ætius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the
      Goths. One of the successors of Torismond purchased the aid of
      the French monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift. When
      he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with
      reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the
      road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom
      of two hundred thousand pieces of gold; and preserved the
      missorium, as the pride of the Gothic treasury. 140 When that
      treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the
      Arabs, they admired, and they have celebrated, another object
      still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of one
      single piece of solid emerald, 141 encircled with three rows of
      fine pearls, supported by three hundred and sixty-five feet of
      gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of five hundred
      thousand pieces of gold. 142 Some portion of the Gothic treasures
      might be the gift of friendship, or the tribute of obedience; but
      the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the
      spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.

      After the deliverance of Italy from the oppression of the Goths,
      some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the
      palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country. 143 By a
      wise and humane regulation, the eight provinces which had been
      the most deeply injured, Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium,
      Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania, obtained an indulgence
      of five years: the ordinary tribute was reduced to one fifth, and
      even that fifth was destined to restore and support the useful
      institution of the public posts. By another law, the lands which
      had been left without inhabitants or cultivation, were granted,
      with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbors who should
      occupy, or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new
      possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive
      proprietors. About the same time a general amnesty was published
      in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all
      the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy
      subjects, during the term of the public disorder and calamity. A
      decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of
      the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices
      which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and
      extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of
      Africa. The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the
      Barbarians, were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and
      pleasure; and Albinus, præfect of Rome, informed the court, with
      some anxiety and surprise, that, in a single day, he had taken an
      account of the arrival of fourteen thousand strangers. 144 In
      less than seven years, the vestiges of the Gothic invasion were
      almost obliterated; and the city appeared to resume its former
      splendor and tranquillity. The venerable matron replaced her
      crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war; and
      was still amused, in the last moment of her decay, with the
      prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion. 145

      145 (return) [ The date of the voyage of Claudius Rutilius
      Numatianus is clogged with some difficulties; but Scaliger has
      deduced from astronomical characters, that he left Rome the 24th
      of September and embarked at Porto the 9th of October, A.D. 416.
      See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom, v. p. 820. In this
      poetical Itinerary, Rutilius (l. i. 115, &c.) addresses Rome in a
      high strain of congratulation:—

      Erige crinales lauros, seniumque sacrati Verticis in virides,
      Roma, recinge comas, &c.]

      This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of
      a hostile armament from the country which afforded the daily
      subsistence of the Roman people. Heraclian, count of Africa, who,
      under the most difficult and distressful circumstances, had
      supported, with active loyalty, the cause of Honorius, was
      tempted, in the year of his consulship, to assume the character
      of a rebel, and the title of emperor. The ports of Africa were
      immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he
      prepared to invade Italy: and his fleet, when it cast anchor at
      the mouth of the Tyber, indeed surpassed the fleets of Xerxes and
      Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley, and
      the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number
      of three thousand two hundred. 146 Yet with such an armament,
      which might have subverted, or restored, the greatest empires of
      the earth, the African usurper made a very faint and feeble
      impression on the provinces of his rival. As he marched from the
      port, along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was
      encountered, terrified, and routed, by one of the Imperial
      captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune
      and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship. 147 When
      Heraclian landed in the harbor of Carthage, he found that the
      whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned
      to their allegiance. The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple
      of Memory; his consulship was abolished: 148 and the remains of
      his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of four
      thousand pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius,
      who had already defended the throne, which he afterwards shared
      with his feeble sovereign. Honorius viewed, with supine
      indifference, the calamities of Rome and Italy; 149 but the
      rebellious attempts of Attalus and Heraclian, against his
      personal safety, awakened, for a moment, the torpid instinct of
      his nature. He was probably ignorant of the causes and events
      which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as Italy
      was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he
      peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants
      beyond the Alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name, and by
      the lieutenants, of the son of Theodosius. 150 In the course of a
      busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention
      the death of such a prince: and I shall therefore take the
      precaution of observing, in this place, that he survived the last
      siege of Rome about thirteen years.

      capital of the world, which had been lost. Yet even this story is

      The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the
      legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
      His title was acknowledged, from the wall of Antoninus to the
      columns of Hercules; and, in the midst of the public disorder he
      shared the dominion, and the plunder, of Gaul and Spain, with the
      tribes of Barbarians, whose destructive progress was no longer
      checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees. Stained with the blood of the
      kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted, from the court of Ravenna, with
      which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his
      rebellious claims. Constantine engaged himself, by a solemn
      promise, to deliver Italy from the Goths; advanced as far as the
      banks of the Po; and after alarming, rather than assisting, his
      pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to
      celebrate, with intemperate luxury, his vain and ostentatious
      triumph. But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and
      destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his
      generals; who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince
      already invested with the Imperial purple, had been left to
      command in the provinces of Spain. From some reason, of which we
      are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed
      it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at
      Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards, through the
      Pyrenees, to surprise the two emperors, Constantine and Constans,
      before they could prepare for their defence. The son was made
      prisoner at Vienna, and immediately put to death: and the
      unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation
      of his family; which had tempted, or compelled him,
      sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic
      life. The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles;
      but those walls must have yielded to the assailants, had not the
      city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Italian
      army. The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor,
      astonished the contending parties of the rebels. Gerontius,
      abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain;
      and rescued his name from oblivion, by the Roman courage which
      appeared to animate the last moments of his life. In the middle
      of the night, a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded
      and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded. His
      wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some
      faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used,
      with so much skill and resolution, a large magazine of darts and
      arrows, that above three hundred of the assailants lost their
      lives in the attempt. His slaves when all the missile weapons
      were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not
      been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their
      example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate
      resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house. In this fatal
      extremity, he complied with the request of his Barbarian friend,
      and cut off his head. The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not
      to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly
      presented her neck to his sword; and the tragic scene was
      terminated by the death of the count himself, who, after three
      ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger, and sheathed it in his
      heart. 151 The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the
      purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was
      entertained of his power and abilities. The caprice of the
      Barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this Imperial
      phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice
      of Honorius; and the tyrant Maximus, after he had been shown to
      the people of Ravenna and Rome, was publicly executed.

      151 (return) [ The praises which Sozomen has bestowed on this act
      of despair, appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an
      ecclesiastical historian. He observes (p. 379) that the wife of
      Gerontius was a Christian; and that her death was worthy of her
      religion, and of immortal fame.]

      The general, (Constantius was his name,) who raised by his
      approach the siege of Arles, and dissipated the troops of
      Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is
      strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the
      subjects of the empire. The strength and majesty which were
      conspicuous in the person of that general, 152 marked him, in the
      popular opinion, as a candidate worthy of the throne, which he
      afterwards ascended. In the familiar intercourse of private life,
      his manners were cheerful and engaging; nor would he sometimes
      disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the
      pantomimes themselves, in the exercises of their ridiculous
      profession. But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he
      mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular
      practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large
      animated eyes round the field, Constantius then struck terror
      into his foes, and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of
      victory. He had received from the court of Ravenna the important
      commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West;
      and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and
      anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of
      a more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a
      successful negotiation with the Franks and Alemanni and his
      ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army, to
      disturb the operations of the siege of Arles. The Roman general,
      instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly and perhaps
      wisely, resolved to pass the Rhone, and to meet the Barbarians.
      His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that,
      while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front, they
      were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed, by the cavalry
      of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an
      advantageous post in their rear. The remains of the army of
      Edobic were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader
      escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless
      friend; who too clearly understood, that the head of his
      obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for
      the Imperial general. On this occasion, Constantius behaved with
      the magnanimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing, or suppressing,
      every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit
      and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the
      assassin of Edobic; and sternly intimated his commands, that the
      camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an
      ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friendship and
      hospitality. The usurper, who beheld, from the walls of Arles,
      the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence
      in so generous a conqueror. He required a solemn promise for his
      security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the
      sacred character of a Christian Presbyter, he ventured to open
      the gates of the city. But he soon experienced that the
      principles of honor and integrity, which might regulate the
      ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose
      doctrines of political morality. The Roman general, indeed,
      refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but
      the abdicated emperor, and his son Julian, were sent under a
      strong guard into Italy; and before they reached the palace of
      Ravenna, they met the ministers of death.

      152 (return) [ It is the expression of Olympiodorus, which he
      seems to have borrowed from Aeolus, a tragedy of Euripides, of
      which some fragments only are now extant, (Euripid. Barnes, tom.
      ii. p. 443, ver 38.) This allusion may prove, that the ancient
      tragic poets were still familiar to the Greeks of the fifth
      century.]

      At a time when it was universally confessed, that almost every
      man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes
      whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a
      rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their
      predecessors, still continued to arise. This mischief was
      peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul, where the
      principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war
      and rebellion. Before Constantine resigned the purple, and in the
      fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in
      the Imperial camp, that Jovinus has assumed the diadem at Mentz,
      in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the
      Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the
      candidate, on whom they had bestowed the empire, advanced with a
      formidable host of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to
      those of the Rhone. Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary
      in the short history of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to
      expect, that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a
      victorious army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the
      justice of the cause of Honorius. The hasty retreat of
      Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons; but he
      resigned, without a struggle, the possession of Gaul; and
      Dardanus, the Prætorian præfect, is recorded as the only
      magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper. 153
      When the Goths, two years after the siege of Rome, established
      their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their
      inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius,
      with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded
      Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional
      purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch. Yet in a
      moment of disgust, (for which it is not easy to assign a cause,
      or a date,) Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul;
      and imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negotiating the
      treaty, which ratified his own disgrace. We are again surprised
      to read, that, instead of considering the Gothic alliance as the
      firmest support of his throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and
      ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that,
      scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the
      purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently
      accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the
      soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a
      prince, who knew not how to reward or punish. Adolphus, educated
      among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the
      most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced
      with a body of ten thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary
      enemy of the house of Balti. He attacked Sarus at an unguarded
      moment, when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his
      valiant followers. United by friendship, animated by despair, but
      at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved
      the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies;
      and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils, 154 than he was
      instantly despatched. The death of Sarus dissolved the loose
      alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of
      Gaul. He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and
      soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he
      would immediately transmit to the palace of Ravenna the heads of
      the two tyrants, Jovinus and Sebastian. The king of the Goths
      executed his promise without difficulty or delay; the helpless
      brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by
      their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of Valentia
      was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of Gaul.
      The emperor, chosen by the Roman senate, who had been promoted,
      degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted,
      was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the Gothic king
      withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt,
      from offering any violence to the person of Attalus. The
      unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies,
      embarked in one of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure
      and solitary retreat: but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to
      the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of
      Rome or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on
      the second step of the throne of his invincible conqueror. The
      same measure of punishment, with which, in the days of his

      on Attalus himself; he was condemned, after the amputation of two
      fingers, to a perpetual exile in the Isle of Lipari, where he was
      supplied with the decent necessaries of life. The remainder of
      the reign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be
      observed, that, in the space of five years, seven usurpers had
      yielded to the fortune of a prince, who was himself incapable
      either of counsel or of action.

      Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By
      Barbarians.—Part VII.

      The situation of Spain, separated, on all sides, from the enemies
      of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate
      provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and
      sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of
      domestic happiness, that, in a period of four hundred years,
      Spain furnished very few materials to the history of the Roman
      empire. The footsteps of the Barbarians, who, in the reign of
      Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon
      obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of
      the Christian era, the cities of Emerita, or Merida, of Corduba,
      Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most
      illustrious of the Roman world. The various plenty of the animal,
      the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and
      manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the
      peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an
      extensive and profitable trade. 155 The arts and sciences
      flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the
      character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude,
      the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and
      desolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle
      some sparks of military ardor. As long as the defence of the
      mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the
      country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the
      Barbarians. But no sooner had the national troops been compelled
      to resign their post to the Honorian bands, in the service of
      Constantine, than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed
      to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of Rome by
      the Goths. 156 The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of
      rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to desert
      their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and
      the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with
      irresistible violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of
      Africa. The misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language
      of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the
      passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary
      writers. 157 “The irruption of these nations was followed by the
      most dreadful calamities; as the Barbarians exercised their
      indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the
      Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open
      country. The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants
      to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild
      beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were
      exasperated, by the taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger,
      boldly to attack and devour their human prey. Pestilence soon
      appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion
      of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited
      only the envy of their surviving friends. At length the
      Barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by
      the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed
      their permanent seats in the depopulated country. The ancient
      Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was
      divided between the Suevi and the Vandals; the Alani were
      scattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania, from
      the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful
      territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi, another branch
      of the Vandalic nation. After regulating this partition, the
      conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal
      engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again
      cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a
      captive people. The greatest part of the Spaniards was even
      disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism,
      to the severe oppressions of the Roman government; yet there were
      many who still asserted their native freedom; and who refused,
      more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the
      Barbarian yoke.” 158

      inter Barbaros pauperem libertatem, quam inter Romanos
      tributariam solicitudinem, sustinere.]

      The important present of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian had
      approved the friendship of Adolphus, and restored Gaul to the
      obedience of his brother Honorius. Peace was incompatible with
      the situation and temper of the king of the Goths. He readily
      accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the
      Barbarians of Spain; the troops of Constantius intercepted his
      communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his
      march towards the Pyrenees: 159 he passed the mountains, and
      surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona. The
      fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride, was not abated by time
      or possession: and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his
      illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him forever in
      the interest of the republic. The loss of that infant, whose
      remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches
      near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the
      Gothic king was suspended by the labors of the field; and the
      course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.

      He had imprudently received into his service one of the followers
      of Sarus; a Barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive
      stature; whose secret desire of revenging the death of his
      beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his
      insolent master. Adolphus was assassinated in the palace of
      Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a
      tumultuous faction; 160 and a stranger to the royal race,
      Singeric, the brother of Sarus himself, was seated on the Gothic
      throne. The first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the
      six children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he
      tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
      161 The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful
      compassion, which she might have excited in the most savage
      breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult. The daughter
      of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar
      captives, was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles,
      before the horse of a Barbarian, the assassin of a husband whom
      Placidia loved and lamented. 162

      159 (return) [ This mixture of force and persuasion may be fairly
      inferred from comparing Orosius and Jornandes, the Roman and the

      160 (return) [ According to the system of Jornandes, (c. 33, p.
      659,) the true hereditary right to the Gothic sceptre was vested
      in the Amali; but those princes, who were the vassals of the
      Huns, commanded the tribes of the Ostrogoths in some distant
      parts of Germany or Scythia.]

      162 (return) [ The death of Adolphus was celebrated at
      Constantinople with illuminations and Circensian games. (See
      Chron. Alexandrin.) It may seem doubtful whether the Greeks were
      actuated, on this occasion, be their hatred of the Barbarians, or
      of the Latins.]

      But Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge, and the view
      of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people
      against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of
      his usurpation. After the death of Singeric, the free choice of
      the nation bestowed the Gothic sceptre on Wallia; whose warlike
      and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign,
      extremely hostile to the republic. He marched in arms from
      Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients
      revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world. But when he
      reached the southern promontory of Spain, 163 and, from the rock
      now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the
      neighboring and fertile coast of Africa, Wallia resumed the
      designs of conquest, which had been interrupted by the death of
      Alaric. The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of
      the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply
      affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks. In
      this disposition the successor of Adolphus no longer refused to
      listen to a Roman ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by
      the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the
      conduct of the brave Constantius. A solemn treaty was stipulated
      and observed; Placidia was honorably restored to her brother; six
      hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry
      Goths; 164 and Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of
      the empire. A bloody war was instantly excited among the
      Barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have
      addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages,
      to the throne of the Western emperor, exhorting him to remain a
      tranquil spectator of their contest; the events of which must be
      favorable to the Romans, by the mutual slaughter of their common
      enemies. 165 The Spanish war was obstinately supported, during
      three campaigns, with desperate valor, and various success; and
      the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the empire
      the superior renown of the Gothic hero. He exterminated the
      Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the
      province of Boetica. He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani;
      and the remains of those Scythian wanderers, who escaped from the
      field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge
      under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever
      afterwards confounded. The Vandals themselves, and the Suevi,
      yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths. The promiscuous
      multitude of Barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were
      driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still
      continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise
      their domestic and implacable hostilities. In the pride of
      victory, Wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his
      Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny
      of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to
      regret the time of their Barbarian servitude. While the event of
      the war was still doubtful, the first advantages obtained by the
      arms of Wallia had encouraged the court of Ravenna to decree the
      honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign. He entered Rome
      like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of
      servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which
      they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and
      orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the
      wisdom, and the invincible courage, of the emperor Honorius. 166

      Idatius and Isidore.]

      Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of
      Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated
      the seeds of the Spanish war. His victorious Goths, forty-three
      years after they had passed the Danube, were established,
      according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the
      second Aquitain; a maritime province between the Garonne and the
      Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
      Bourdeaux. That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade
      of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its
      numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their
      wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners. The
      adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden
      of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil, and a temperate
      climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the
      rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils,
      luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain. 167 The
      Gothic limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some
      neighboring dioceses; and the successors of Alaric fixed their
      royal residence at Thoulouse, which included five populous
      quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
      About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius,
      the Goths, the Burgundians, and the Franks, obtained a permanent
      seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul. The liberal grant of
      the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian allies, was confirmed by
      the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, Germany,
      were ceded to those formidable Barbarians; and they gradually
      occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the two provinces which
      still retain, with the titles of Duchy and County, the national
      appellation of Burgundy. 168 The Franks, the valiant and faithful
      allies of the Roman republic, were soon tempted to imitate the
      invaders, whom they had so bravely resisted. Treves, the capital
      of Gaul, was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble
      colony, which they so long maintained in the district of
      Toxandia, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of
      the Meuse and Scheld, till their independent power filled the
      whole extent of the Second, or Lower Germany. These facts may be
      sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation
      of the French monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and
      even the existence, of that hero, have been justly arraigned by
      the impartial severity of modern criticism. 169

      seventh century. The author of the Gesta Francorum (in tom. ii.
      p. 543) suggests, probably enough, that the choice of Pharamond,
      or at least of a king, was recommended to the Franks by his
      father Marcomir, who was an exile in Tuscany. Note: The first

      The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul may be dated from the
      establishment of these Barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous
      and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest
      or passion, to violate the public peace. A heavy and partial
      ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials, who had escaped
      the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were
      assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their
      families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling
      natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their
      fathers. Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot
      of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the Romans
      themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in
      the madness of civil discord. The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen
      of the most flourishing colonies of Italy; and distributed their
      lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of
      Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country. Two poets of
      unequal fame have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of
      their patrimony; but the legionaries of Augustus appear to have
      surpassed, in violence and injustice, the Barbarians who invaded
      Gaul under the reign of Honorius. It was not without the utmost
      difficulty that Virgil escaped from the sword of the Centurion,
      who had usurped his farm in the neighborhood of Mantua; 170 but
      Paulinus of Bourdeaux received a sum of money from his Gothic
      purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and
      though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this
      act of rapine was disguised by some colors of moderation and
      equity. 171 The odious name of conquerors was softened into the
      mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and
      the Barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly
      declared, that they were bound to the people by the ties of
      hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and
      military service. The title of Honorius and his successors, their
      laws, and their civil magistrates, were still respected in the
      provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to
      the Barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and
      independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously
      solicited the more honorable rank of master-generals of the
      Imperial armies. 172 Such was the involuntary reverence which the
      Roman name still impressed on the minds of those warriors, who
      had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.

      Whilst Italy was ravaged by the Goths, and a succession of feeble
      tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the British
      island separated itself from the body of the Roman empire. The
      regular forces, which guarded that remote province, had been
      gradually withdrawn; and Britain was abandoned without defence to
      the Saxon pirates, and the savages of Ireland and Caledonia. The
      Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy
      and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy. They assembled in arms,
      repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of
      their own strength. 173 Afflicted by similar calamities, and
      actuated by the same spirit, the Armorican provinces (a name
      which comprehended the maritime countries of Gaul between the
      Seine and the Loire 174 resolved to imitate the example of the
      neighboring island. They expelled the Roman magistrates, who
      acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free
      government was established among a people who had so long been
      subject to the arbitrary will of a master. The independence of
      Britain and Armorica was soon confirmed by Honorius himself, the
      lawful emperor of the West; and the letters, by which he
      committed to the new states the care of their own safety, might
      be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the
      exercise and rights of sovereignty. This interpretation was, in
      some measure, justified by the event.

      After the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen, the maritime
      provinces were restored to the empire. Yet their obedience was
      imperfect and precarious: the vain, inconstant, rebellious
      disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom
      or servitude; 175 and Armorica, though it could not long maintain
      the form of a republic, 176 was agitated by frequent and
      destructive revolts. Britain was irrecoverably lost. 177 But as
      the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote
      province, the separation was not imbittered by the reproach of
      tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection
      were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national
      friendship. 178

      12, p. 50, edit. Smith) acknowledges that the Romans finally left
      Britain in the reign of Honorius. Yet our modern historians and
      antiquaries extend the term of their dominion; and there are some
      who allow only the interval of a few months between their
      departure and the arrival of the Saxons.]

      will hereafter be produced, that the independent Britons raised
      12,000 men for the service of the emperor Anthemius, in Gaul.]

      This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and
      military government; and the independent country, during a period
      of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the
      authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns. 179
      I. Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular
      transaction, very accurately observes, that the letters of
      Honorius were addressed to the cities of Britain. 180 Under the
      protection of the Romans, ninety-two considerable towns had
      arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among
      these, thirty-three cities were distinguished above the rest by
      their superior privileges and importance. 181 Each of these
      cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a
      legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic
      policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed
      among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of
      the people, according to the original model of the Roman
      constitution. 182 The management of a common revenue, the
      exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of
      public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty
      republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth
      of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range
      themselves under the standard of the magistrate. But the desire
      of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burdens, of
      political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of
      discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed, that the restoration
      of British freedom was exempt from tumult and faction. The
      preeminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently
      violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles,
      who complained that they were become the subjects of their own
      servants, 183 would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary
      monarch.

      II. The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country, was
      supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators;
      and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land,
      consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these
      rising republics. The sphere of their attraction was proportioned
      to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but
      the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed
      by the neighborhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of
      independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and
      war. The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation
      of Italian elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles,
      the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country: 184 the
      produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to
      maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of
      licentious followers; and the chieftain might assume, within his
      own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate. Several of these
      British chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings;
      and many more would be tempted to adopt this honorable genealogy,
      and to vindicate their hereditary claims, which had been
      suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars. 185 Their situation
      and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the
      language, and the customs of their ancestors. If the princes of
      Britain relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously
      preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must
      have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national
      parties; again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and
      faction, by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
      The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign
      enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the
      personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head
      of his equals, might enable him to subdue the freedom of some
      neighboring cities; and to claim a rank among the tyrants, 186
      who infested Britain after the dissolution of the Roman
      government. III. The British church might be composed of thirty
      or forty bishops, 187 with an adequate proportion of the inferior
      clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor
      188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem, by a decent
      and exemplary behavior.

      The interest, as well as the temper of the clergy, was favorable
      to the peace and union of their distracted country: those
      salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular
      discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that
      could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.

      In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat
      promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the
      state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated;
      differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed,
      wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and
      there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a
      Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the
      Britons. These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal
      character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition;
      and the British clergy incessantly labored to eradicate the
      Pelagian heresy, which they abhorred, as the peculiar disgrace of
      their native country. 189

      It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural,
      that the revolt of Britain and Armorica should have introduced an
      appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul. In a
      solemn edict, 190 filled with the strongest assurances of that
      paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom
      feel, the emperor Honorius promulgated his intention of convening
      an annual assembly of the seven provinces: a name peculiarly
      appropriated to Aquitain and the ancient Narbonnese, which had
      long since exchanged their Celtic rudeness for the useful and
      elegant arts of Italy. 191 Arles, the seat of government and
      commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly; which
      regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of
      August to the thirteenth of September, of every year. It
      consisted of the Prætorian præfect of the Gauls; of seven
      provincial governors, one consular, and six presidents; of the
      magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about sixty cities; and
      of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honorable
      and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as
      the representatives of their country. They were empowered to
      interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose
      the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the
      excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every
      subject of local or national importance, that could tend to the
      restoration of the peace and prosperity of the seven provinces.
      If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in
      their own government, had been universally established by Trajan
      or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might
      have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome. The
      privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the
      monarch; the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have
      been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the
      interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country
      would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of
      natives and freemen. Under the mild and generous influence of
      liberty, the Roman empire might have remained invincible and
      immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of
      human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital
      and constituent members might have separately preserved their
      vigor and independence. But in the decline of the empire, when
      every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy
      application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any
      important or salutary effects. The emperor Honorius expresses his
      surprise, that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a
      privilege which they should ardently have solicited. A fine of
      three, or even five, pounds of gold, was imposed on the absent
      representatives; who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of
      a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their
      oppressors.

      I.

     Arcadius Emperor Of The East.—Administration And Disgrace Of
     Eutropius.—Revolt Of Gainas.—Persecution Of St. John
     Chrysostom.—Theodosius II. Emperor Of The East.—His Sister
     Pulcheria.—His Wife Eudocia.—The Persian War, And Division Of
     Armenia.

      The division of the Roman world between the sons of Theodosius
      marks the final establishment of the empire of the East, which,
      from the reign of Arcadius to the taking of Constantinople by the
      Turks, subsisted one thousand and fifty-eight years, in a state
      of premature and perpetual decay. The sovereign of that empire
      assumed, and obstinately retained, the vain, and at length
      fictitious, title of Emperor of the Romans; and the hereditary
      appellation of Caesar and Augustus continued to declare, that he
      was the legitimate successor of the first of men, who had reigned
      over the first of nations. The place of Constantinople rivalled,
      and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of Persia; and the
      eloquent sermons of St. Chrysostom 1 celebrate, while they
      condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of Arcadius. “The
      emperor,” says he, “wears on his head either a diadem, or a crown
      of gold, decorated with precious stones of inestimable value.
      These ornaments, and his purple garments, are reserved for his
      sacred person alone; and his robes of silk are embroidered with
      the figures of golden dragons. His throne is of massy gold.
      Whenever he appears in public, he is surrounded by his courtiers,
      his guards, and his attendants. Their spears, their shields,
      their cuirasses, the bridles and trappings of their horses, have
      either the substance or the appearance of gold; and the large
      splendid boss in the midst of their shield is encircled with
      smaller bosses, which represent the shape of the human eye. The
      two mules that drew the chariot of the monarch are perfectly
      white, and shining all over with gold. The chariot itself, of
      pure and solid gold, attracts the admiration of the spectators,
      who contemplate the purple curtains, the snowy carpet, the size
      of the precious stones, and the resplendent plates of gold, that
      glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. The
      Imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor
      appears seated on his throne, with his arms, his horses, and his
      guards beside him; and his vanquished enemies in chains at his
      feet.” The successors of Constantine established their perpetual
      residence in the royal city, which he had erected on the verge of
      Europe and Asia. Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies,
      and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received,
      with each wind, the tributary productions of every climate; while
      the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to
      defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians. Their dominions were
      bounded by the Adriatic and the Tigris; and the whole interval of
      twenty-five days’ navigation, which separated the extreme cold of
      Scythia from the torrid zone of Æthiopia, 2 was comprehended
      within the limits of the empire of the East. The populous
      countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning, of
      luxury and wealth; and the inhabitants, who had assumed the
      language and manners of Greeks, styled themselves, with some
      appearance of truth, the most enlightened and civilized portion
      of the human species. The form of government was a pure and
      simple monarchy; the name of the Roman Republic, which so long
      preserved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the Latin
      provinces; and the princes of Constantinople measured their
      greatness by the servile obedience of their people. They were
      ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades
      every faculty of the mind. The subjects, who had resigned their
      will to the absolute commands of a master, were equally incapable
      of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the
      Barbarians, or of defending their reason from the terrors of
      superstition.

      The first events of the reign of Arcadius and Honorius are so
      intimately connected, that the rebellion of the Goths, and the
      fall of Rufinus, have already claimed a place in the history of
      the West. It has already been observed, that Eutropius, 3 one of
      the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople, succeeded
      the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished, and whose
      vices he soon imitated. Every order of the state bowed to the new
      favorite; and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him
      to insult the laws, and, what is still more difficult and
      dangerous, the manners of his country. Under the weakest of the
      predecessors of Arcadius, the reign of the eunuchs had been
      secret and almost invisible. They insinuated themselves into the
      confidence of the prince; but their ostensible functions were
      confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and Imperial
      bed-chamber. They might direct, in a whisper, the public
      counsels, and blast, by their malicious suggestions, the fame and
      fortunes of the most illustrious citizens; but they never
      presumed to stand forward in the front of empire, 4 or to profane
      the public honors of the state. Eutropius was the first of his
      artificial sex, who dared to assume the character of a Roman
      magistrate and general. Sometimes, in the presence of the
      blushing senate, he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment,
      or to repeat elaborate harangues; and, sometimes, appeared on
      horseback, at the head of his troops, in the dress and armor of a
      hero. The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak
      and ill-regulated mind; nor does Eutropius seem to have
      compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or
      ability in the execution. His former habits of life had not
      introduced him to the study of the laws, or the exercises of the
      field; his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret
      contempt of the spectators; the Goths expressed their wish that
      such a general might always command the armies of Rome; and the
      name of the minister was branded with ridicule, more pernicious,
      perhaps, than hatred, to a public character. The subjects of
      Arcadius were exasperated by the recollection, that this deformed
      and decrepit eunuch, 6 who so perversely mimicked the actions of
      a man, was born in the most abject condition of servitude; that
      before he entered the Imperial palace, he had been successively
      sold and purchased by a hundred masters, who had exhausted his
      youthful strength in every mean and infamous office, and at
      length dismissed him, in his old age, to freedom and poverty. 7
      While these disgraceful stories were circulated, and perhaps
      exaggerated, in private conversation, the vanity of the favorite
      was flattered with the most extraordinary honors. In the senate,
      in the capital, in the provinces, the statues of Eutropius were
      erected, in brass, or marble, decorated with the symbols of his
      civil and military virtues, and inscribed with the pompous title
      of the third founder of Constantinople. He was promoted to the
      rank of patrician, which began to signify in a popular, and even
      legal, acceptation, the father of the emperor; and the last year
      of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of a eunuch
      and a slave. This strange and inexpiable prodigy 8 awakened,
      however, the prejudices of the Romans. The effeminate consul was
      rejected by the West, as an indelible stain to the annals of the
      republic; and without invoking the shades of Brutus and Camillus,
      the colleague of Eutropius, a learned and respectable magistrate,
      9 sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two
      administrations.

      3 (return) [ Barthius, who adored his author with the blind

      other productions, (Baillet Jugemens des Savans, tom. iv. p.
      227.) They are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire; and
      would be more valuable in an historical light, if the invective
      were less vague and more temperate.]

      humor which always pleases in a satiric poet, describes the
      insolent folly of the eunuch, the disgrace of the empire, and the
      joy of the Goths.

      paint was washed away the face of Eutropius appeared more ugly
      and wrinkled than that of an old woman. Claudian remarks, (i.

      there was scarcely an interval between the youth and the decrepit

      describes, were these: 1. He spent many years as the catamite of
      Ptolemy, a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables. 2. Ptolemy
      gave him to the old general Arintheus, for whom he very skilfully
      exercised the profession of a pimp. 3. He was given, on her
      marriage, to the daughter of Arintheus; and the future consul was
      employed to comb her hair, to present the silver ewer to wash and
      to fan his mistress in hot weather. See l. i. 31-137.]

      The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems to have been actuated
      by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit; but the avarice of
      the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the præfect. 10
      As long as he despoiled the oppressors, who had enriched
      themselves with the plunder of the people, Eutropius might
      gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice:
      but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had
      been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable industry. The
      usual methods of extortion were practised and improved; and
      Claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public
      auction of the state. “The impotence of the eunuch,” says that
      agreeable satirist, “has served only to stimulate his avarice:
      the same hand which in his servile condition, was exercised in
      petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his master, now grasps the
      riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the empire
      appreciates and divides the Roman provinces from Mount Haemus to
      the Tigris. One man, at the expense of his villa, is made
      proconsul of Asia; a second purchases Syria with his wife’s
      jewels; and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal
      estate for the government of Bithynia. In the antechamber of
      Eutropius, a large tablet is exposed to public view, which marks
      the respective prices of the provinces. The different value of
      Pontus, of Galatia, of Lydia, is accurately distinguished. Lycia
      may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold; but the
      opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum. The
      eunuch wishes to obliterate, by the general disgrace, his
      personal ignominy; and as he has been sold himself, he is
      desirous of selling the rest of mankind. In the eager contention,
      the balance, which contains the fate and fortunes of the
      province, often trembles on the beam; and till one of the scales
      is inclined, by a superior weight, the mind of the impartial
      judge remains in anxious suspense. Such,” continues the indignant
      poet, “are the fruits of Roman valor, of the defeat of Antiochus,
      and of the triumph of Pompey.” This venal prostitution of public
      honors secured the impunity of future crimes; but the riches,
      which Eutropius derived from confiscation, were already stained
      with injustice; since it was decent to accuse, and to condemn,
      the proprietors of the wealth, which he was impatient to
      confiscate. Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the
      executioner; and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire
      were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles. Among the
      generals and consuls of the East, Abundantius 12 had reason to
      dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutropius. He had
      been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject
      slave to the palace of Constantinople; and some degree of praise
      must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite, who was
      satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was
      stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript, and
      banished to Pityus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the Roman
      world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the
      Barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a
      milder exile at Sidon, in Phoenicia. The destruction of Timasius
      13 required a more serious and regular mode of attack. That great
      officer, the master-general of the armies of Theodosius, had
      signalized his valor by a decisive victory, which he obtained
      over the Goths of Thessaly; but he was too prone, after the
      example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to
      abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers.
      Timasius had despised the public clamor, by promoting an infamous
      dependant to the command of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the
      ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly instigated by the
      favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy. The
      general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself;
      and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to
      suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign. But as this
      form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the further
      inquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Saturninus
      and Procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still
      respected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens. The
      appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the
      blunt honesty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the
      obsequious dexterity of his colleague, who pronounced a sentence
      of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius. His immense
      riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor, and for the
      benefit of the favorite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile a
      Oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of
      Libya. 14 Secluded from all human converse, the master-general of
      the Roman armies was lost forever to the world; but the
      circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and
      contradictory manner. It is insinuated that Eutropius despatched
      a private order for his secret execution. 15 It was reported,
      that, in attempting to escape from Oasis, he perished in the
      desert, of thirst and hunger; and that his dead body was found on
      the sands of Libya. 16 It has been asserted, with more
      confidence, that his son Syagrius, after successfully eluding the
      pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court, collected a
      band of African robbers; that he rescued Timasius from the place
      of his exile; and that both the father and the son disappeared
      from the knowledge of mankind. 17 But the ungrateful Bargus,
      instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon
      after circumvented and destroyed, by the more powerful villany of
      the minister himself, who retained sense and spirit enough to
      abhor the instrument of his own crimes.

      The public hatred, and the despair of individuals, continually
      threatened, or seemed to threaten, the personal safety of
      Eutropius; as well as of the numerous adherents, who were
      attached to his fortune, and had been promoted by his venal
      favor. For their mutual defence, he contrived the safeguard of a
      law, which violated every principal of humanity and justice. 18
      I. It is enacted, in the name, and by the authority of Arcadius,
      that all those who should conspire, either with subjects or with
      strangers, against the lives of any of the persons whom the
      emperor considers as the members of his own body, shall be
      punished with death and confiscation. This species of fictitious
      and metaphorical treason is extended to protect, not only the
      illustrious officers of the state and army, who were admitted
      into the sacred consistory, but likewise the principal domestics
      of the palace, the senators of Constantinople, the military
      commanders, and the civil magistrates of the provinces; a vague
      and indefinite list, which, under the successors of Constantine,
      included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers.
      II. This extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been
      only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from
      any actual violence in the execution of their office. But the
      whole body of Imperial dependants claimed a privilege, or rather
      impunity, which screened them, in the loosest moments of their
      lives, from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of
      their fellow-citizens; and, by a strange perversion of the laws,
      the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private
      quarrel, and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and
      the empire. The edicts of Arcadius most positively and most
      absurdly declares, that in such cases of treason, thoughts and
      actions ought to be punished with equal severity; that the
      knowledge of a mischievous intention, unless it be instantly
      revealed, becomes equally criminal with the intention itself; 19
      and that those rash men, who shall presume to solicit the pardon
      of traitors, shall themselves be branded with public and
      perpetual infamy. III. “With regard to the sons of the traitors,”
      (continues the emperor,) “although they ought to share the
      punishment, since they will probably imitate the guilt, of their
      parents, yet, by the special effect of our Imperial lenity, we
      grant them their lives; but, at the same time, we declare them
      incapable of inheriting, either on the father’s or on the
      mother’s side, or of receiving any gift or legacy, from the
      testament either of kinsmen or of strangers. Stigmatized with
      hereditary infamy, excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune,
      let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt, till they
      shall consider life as a calamity, and death as a comfort and
      relief.” In such words, so well adapted to insult the feelings of
      mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favorite eunuch, applaud
      the moderation of a law, which transferred the same unjust and
      inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded,
      or who had not disclosed, their fictitious conspiracies. Some of
      the noblest regulations of Roman jurisprudence have been suffered
      to expire; but this edict, a convenient and forcible engine of
      ministerial tyranny, was carefully inserted in the codes of
      Theodosius and Justinian; and the same maxims have been revived
      in modern ages, to protect the electors of Germany, and the
      cardinals of the church of Rome. 20

      improvement of the subtle Tribonian. Godefroy, in a formal
      dissertation, which he has inserted in his Commentary,

      Yet these sanguinary laws, which spread terror among a disarmed
      and dispirited people, were of too weak a texture to restrain the
      bold enterprise of Tribigild 21 the Ostrogoth. The colony of that
      warlike nation, which had been planted by Theodosius in one of
      the most fertile districts of Phrygia, 22 impatiently compared
      the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful
      rapine and liberal rewards of Alaric; and their leader resented,
      as a personal affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace
      of Constantinople. A soft and wealthy province, in the heart of
      the empire, was astonished by the sound of war; and the faithful
      vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed, was again
      respected, as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a
      Barbarian. The vineyards and fruitful fields, between the rapid
      Marsyas and the winding Maeander, 23 were consumed with fire; the
      decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust, at the first
      stroke of an enemy; the trembling inhabitants escaped from a
      bloody massacre to the shores of the Hellespont; and a
      considerable part of Asia Minor was desolated by the rebellion of
      Tribigild. His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of
      the peasants of Pamphylia; and the Ostrogoths, attacked in a
      narrow pass, between the city of Selgae, 24 a deep morass, and
      the craggy cliffs of Mount Taurus, were defeated with the loss of
      their bravest troops. But the spirit of their chief was not
      daunted by misfortune; and his army was continually recruited by
      swarms of Barbarians and outlaws, who were desirous of exercising
      the profession of robbery, under the more honorable names of war
      and conquest. The rumors of the success of Tribigild might for
      some time be suppressed by fear, or disguised by flattery; yet
      they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. Every
      misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the
      future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious
      conjecture. Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country,
      the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage
      of Mount Taurus, and the invasion of Syria. If he descended
      towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the
      Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the
      harbors of Ionia, and of extending his depredations along the
      maritime coast, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of
      Constantinople. The approach of danger, and the obstinacy of
      Tribigild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled
      Eutropius to summon a council of war. 25 After claiming for
      himself the privilege of a veteran soldier, the eunuch intrusted
      the guard of Thrace and the Hellespont to Gainas the Goth, and
      the command of the Asiatic army to his favorite, Leo; two
      generals, who differently, but effectually, promoted the cause of
      the rebels. Leo, 26 who, from the bulk of his body, and the
      dulness of his mind, was surnamed the Ajax of the East, had
      deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise, with
      much less skill and success, the military profession; and his
      uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed, with
      an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous neglect of
      every favorable opportunity. The rashness of the Ostrogoths had
      drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the Rivers
      Melas and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the
      peasants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an Imperial army,
      instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of
      safety and victory. Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the
      Romans, in the darkness of the night; seduced the faith of the
      greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated,
      without much effort, the troops, which had been corrupted by the
      relaxation of discipline, and the luxury of the capital. The
      discontent of Gainas, who had so boldly contrived and executed
      the death of Rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his
      unworthy successor; he accused his own dishonorable patience
      under the servile reign of a eunuch; and the ambitious Goth was
      convicted, at least in the public opinion, of secretly fomenting
      the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was connected by a
      domestic, as well as by a national alliance. 27 When Gainas
      passed the Hellespont, to unite under his standard the remains of
      the Asiatic troops, he skilfully adapted his motions to the
      wishes of the Ostrogoths; abandoning, by his retreat, the country
      which they desired to invade; or facilitating, by his approach,
      the desertion of the Barbarian auxiliaries. To the Imperial court
      he repeatedly magnified the valor, the genius, the inexhaustible
      resources of Tribigild; confessed his own inability to prosecute
      the war; and extorted the permission of negotiating with his
      invincible adversary. The conditions of peace were dictated by
      the haughty rebel; and the peremptory demand of the head of
      Eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile
      conspiracy.

      Chapter XXXII: Emperors Arcadius, Eutropius, Theodosius II.—Part
      II.

      The bold satirist, who has indulged his discontent by the partial
      and passionate censure of the Christian emperors, violates the
      dignity, rather than the truth, of history, by comparing the son
      of Theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals, who
      scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd. Two
      passions, however, fear and conjugal affection, awakened the
      languid soul of Arcadius: he was terrified by the threats of a
      victorious Barbarian; and he yielded to the tender eloquence of
      his wife Eudoxia, who, with a flood of artificial tears,
      presenting her infant children to their father, implored his
      justice for some real or imaginary insult, which she imputed to
      the audacious eunuch. 28 The emperor’s hand was directed to sign
      the condemnation of Eutropius; the magic spell, which during four
      years had bound the prince and the people, was instantly
      dissolved; and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit
      and fortune of the favorite, were converted into the clamors of
      the soldiers and people, who reproached his crimes, and pressed
      his immediate execution. In this hour of distress and despair,
      his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church, whose
      privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe;
      and the most eloquent of the saints, John Chrysostom, enjoyed the
      triumph of protecting a prostrate minister, whose choice had
      raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople. The
      archbishop, ascending the pulpit of the cathedral, that he might
      be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either
      sex and of every age, pronounced a seasonable and pathetic
      discourse on the forgiveness of injuries, and the instability of
      human greatness. The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch,
      who lay grovelling under the table of the altar, exhibited a
      solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was
      afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius,
      labored to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury,
      of the people. 29 The powers of humanity, of superstition, and of
      eloquence, prevailed. The empress Eudoxia was restrained by her
      own prejudices, or by those of her subjects, from violating the
      sanctuary of the church; and Eutropius was tempted to capitulate,
      by the milder arts of persuasion, and by an oath, that his life
      should be spared. 30 Careless of the dignity of their sovereign,
      the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to
      declare, that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul
      and patrician, to abolish his statues, to confiscate his wealth,
      and to inflict a perpetual exile in the Island of Cyprus. 31 A
      despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of
      his enemies; nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained,
      the comforts of peace, of solitude, and of a happy climate. But
      their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a
      miserable life, and Eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of
      Cyprus, than he was hastily recalled. The vain hope of eluding,
      by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the
      empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from
      Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon. The consul
      Aurelian pronounced the sentence; and the motives of that
      sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government. The
      crimes which Eutropius had committed against the people might
      have justified his death; but he was found guilty of harnessing
      to his chariot the sacred animals, who, from their breed or
      color, were reserved for the use of the emperor alone. 32

      While this domestic revolution was transacted, Gainas 33 openly
      revolted from his allegiance; united his forces at Thyatira in
      Lydia, with those of Tribigild; and still maintained his superior
      ascendant over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths. The
      confederate armies advanced, without resistance, to the straits
      of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus; and Arcadius was instructed
      to prevent the loss of his Asiatic dominions, by resigning his
      authority and his person to the faith of the Barbarians. The
      church of the holy martyr Euphemia, situate on a lofty eminence
      near Chalcedon, 34 was chosen for the place of the interview.
      Gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor, whilst he
      required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus, two ministers
      of consular rank; and their naked necks were exposed, by the
      haughty rebel, to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to
      grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite. The Goths,
      according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately
      transported from Asia into Europe; and their victorious chief,
      who accepted the title of master-general of the Roman armies,
      soon filled Constantinople with his troops, and distributed among
      his dependants the honors and rewards of the empire. In his early
      youth, Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant and a
      fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune;
      and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his
      rapid downfall. Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the
      archbishop, he importunately claimed for his Arian sectaries the
      possession of a peculiar church; and the pride of the Catholics
      was offended by the public toleration of heresy. 35 Every quarter
      of Constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder; and the
      Barbarians gazed with such ardor on the rich shops of the
      jewellers, and the tables of the bankers, which were covered with
      gold and silver, that it was judged prudent to remove those
      dangerous temptations from their sight. They resented the
      injurious precaution; and some alarming attempts were made,
      during the night, to attack and destroy with fire the Imperial
      palace. 36 In this state of mutual and suspicious hostility, the
      guards and the people of Constantinople shut the gates, and rose
      in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths.
      During the absence of Gainas, his troops were surprised and
      oppressed; seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody
      massacre. In the fury of the pursuit, the Catholics uncovered the
      roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood, till they
      overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or
      conventicle of the Arians. Gainas was either innocent of the
      design, or too confident of his success; he was astonished by the
      intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously
      destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that
      his countryman, Fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had
      assumed the management of the war by sea and land. The
      enterprises of the rebel, against the cities of Thrace, were
      encountered by a firm and well-ordered defence; his hungry
      soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin
      of the fortifications; and Gainas, who vainly regretted the
      wealth and luxury of Asia, embraced a desperate resolution of
      forcing the passage of the Hellespont. He was destitute of
      vessels; but the woods of the Chersonesus afforded materials for
      rafts, and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust
      themselves to the waves. But Fravitta attentively watched the
      progress of their undertaking. As soon as they had gained the
      middle of the stream, the Roman galleys, 37 impelled by the full
      force of oars, of the current, and of a favorable wind, rushed
      forwards in compact order, and with irresistible weight; and the
      Hellespont was covered with the fragments of the Gothic
      shipwreck. After the destruction of his hopes, and the loss of
      many thousands of his bravest soldiers, Gainas, who could no
      longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans, determined to
      resume the independence of a savage life. A light and active body
      of Barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry and baggage,
      might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles
      from the Hellespont to the Danube; 38 the garrisons of that
      important frontier had been gradually annihilated; the river, in
      the month of December, would be deeply frozen; and the unbounded
      prospect of Scythia was opened to the ambition of Gainas. This
      design was secretly communicated to the national troops, who
      devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before
      the signal of departure was given, a great number of provincial
      auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native
      country, were perfidiously massacred. The Goths advanced, by
      rapid marches, through the plains of Thrace; and they were soon
      delivered from the fear of a pursuit, by the vanity of Fravitta,
      3811 who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the
      popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honors of the
      consulship. But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate
      the majesty of the empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of
      Scythia. 39 The superior forces of Uldin, king of the Huns,
      opposed the progress of Gainas; a hostile and ruined country
      prohibited his retreat; he disdained to capitulate; and after
      repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the
      enemy, he was slain, with his desperate followers, in the field
      of battle. Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont,
      the head of Gainas, the inestimable gift of the conqueror, was
      received at Constantinople with the most liberal expressions of
      gratitude; and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals
      and illuminations. The triumphs of Arcadius became the subject of
      epic poems; 40 and the monarch, no longer oppressed by any
      hostile terrors, resigned himself to the mild and absolute
      dominion of his wife, the fair and artful Eudoxia, who was
      sullied her fame by the persecution of St. John Chrysostom.

      After the death of the indolent Nectarius, the successor of
      Gregory Nazianzen, the church of Constantinople was distracted by
      the ambition of rival candidates, who were not ashamed to
      solicit, with gold or flattery, the suffrage of the people, or of
      the favorite. On this occasion Eutropius seems to have deviated
      from his ordinary maxims; and his uncorrupted judgment was
      determined only by the superior merit of a stranger. In a late
      journey into the East, he had admired the sermons of John, a
      native and presbyter of Antioch, whose name has been
      distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom, or the Golden Mouth.
      41 A private order was despatched to the governor of Syria; and
      as the people might be unwilling to resign their favorite
      preacher, he was transported, with speed and secrecy in a
      post-chariot, from Antioch to Constantinople. The unanimous and
      unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people,
      ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as
      an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations
      of the public. Born of a noble and opulent family, in the capital
      of Syria, Chrysostom had been educated, by the care of a tender
      mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters. He studied
      the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius; and that
      celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his
      disciple, ingenuously confessed that John would have deserved to
      succeed him, had he not been stolen away by the Christians. His
      piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to
      renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law; and
      to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the
      lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years. His
      infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind;
      and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service
      of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on
      the archiepiscopal throne, Chrysostom still persevered in the
      practice of the monastic virtues. The ample revenues, which his
      predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he diligently
      applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes,
      who were supported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and
      edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the
      theatre or the circus. The monuments of that eloquence, which was
      admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople, have
      been carefully preserved; and the possession of near one thousand
      sermons, or homilies has authorized the critics 42 of succeeding
      times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom. They
      unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of
      an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the
      advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and
      philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of
      ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar
      topics; the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of
      virtue; and of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of
      vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic
      representation.

      biographers of the saint. 1. The author of a partial and
      passionate Vindication of the archbishop of Constantinople,
      composed in the form of a dialogue, and under the name of his
      zealous partisan, Palladius, bishop of Helenopolis, (Tillemont,
      Mem. Eccles. tom. xi. p. 500-533.) It is inserted among the works
      of Chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 1-90, edit. Montfaucon. 2. The
      moderate Erasmus, (tom. iii. epist. Mcl. p. 1331-1347, edit.
      Lugd. Bat.) His vivacity and good sense were his own; his errors,
      in the uncultivated state of ecclesiastical antiquity, were
      almost inevitable. 3. The learned Tillemont, (Mem.
      Ecclesiastiques, tom. xi. p. 1-405, 547-626, &c. &c.,) who
      compiles the lives of the saints with incredible patience and
      religious accuracy. He has minutely searched the voluminous works
      of Chrysostom himself. 4. Father Montfaucon, who has perused
      those works with the curious diligence of an editor, discovered
      several new homilies, and again reviewed and composed the Life of
      Chrysostom, (Opera Chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 91-177.)]

      42 (return) [ As I am almost a stranger to the voluminous sermons
      of Chrysostom, I have given my confidence to the two most
      judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics, Erasmus
      (tom. iii. p. 1344) and Dupin, (Bibliothèque Ecclesiastique, tom.
      iii. p. 38:) yet the good taste of the former is sometimes
      vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity; and the good sense of
      the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations.]

      The pastoral labors of the archbishop of Constantinople provoked,
      and gradually united against him, two sorts of enemies; the
      aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate
      sinners, who were offended by his reproofs. When Chrysostom
      thundered, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, against the degeneracy
      of the Christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without
      wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual. When
      he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, poverty
      might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives; but the
      guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach
      itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment.
      But as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly
      diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the
      favorite eunuchs, the ladies of the court, 43 the empress Eudoxia
      herself, had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a
      smaller proportion of criminals. The personal applications of the
      audience were anticipated, or confirmed, by the testimony of
      their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the
      dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to
      the public abhorrence. The secret resentment of the court
      encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of
      Constantinople, who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal
      of their archbishop. He had condemned, from the pulpit, the
      domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople, who, under the
      name of servants, or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion
      either of sin or of scandal. The silent and solitary ascetics,
      who had secluded themselves from the world, were entitled to the
      warmest approbation of Chrysostom; but he despised and
      stigmatized, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd
      of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure
      or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital. To
      the voice of persuasion, the archbishop was obliged to add the
      terrors of authority; and his ardor, in the exercise of
      ecclesiastical jurisdiction, was not always exempt from passion;
      nor was it always guided by prudence. Chrysostom was naturally of
      a choleric disposition. 44 Although he struggled, according to
      the precepts of the gospel, to love his private enemies, he
      indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God
      and of the church; and his sentiments were sometimes delivered
      with too much energy of countenance and expression. He still
      maintained, from some considerations of health or abstinence, his
      former habits of taking his repasts alone; and this inhospitable
      custom, 45 which his enemies imputed to pride, contributed, at
      least, to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor.
      Separated from that familiar intercourse, which facilitates the
      knowledge and the despatch of business, he reposed an
      unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion; and seldom
      applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the
      particular character, either of his dependants, or of his equals.

      Conscious of the purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the
      superiority of his genius, the archbishop of Constantinople
      extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city, that he might
      enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors; and the conduct which
      the profane imputed to an ambitious motive, appeared to
      Chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable
      duty. In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces, he deposed
      thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia; and indiscreetly declared
      that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected
      the whole episcopal order. 46 If those bishops were innocent,
      such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well-grounded
      discontent. If they were guilty, the numerous associates of their
      guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the
      ruin of the archbishop; whom they studied to represent as the
      tyrant of the Eastern church.

      reproached their affectation to conceal, by the ornaments of
      dress, their age and ugliness, (Pallad p. 27.) Olympias, by equal
      zeal, displayed in a more pious cause, has obtained the title of

      had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the

      or devotion, often kept him fasting till sunset. 4. He detested
      the noise and levity of great dinners. 5. He saved the expense
      for the use of the poor. 6. He was apprehensive, in a capital
      like Constantinople, of the envy and reproach of partial
      invitations.]

      46 (return) [ Chrysostom declares his free opinion (tom. ix. hom.
      iii in Act. Apostol. p. 29) that the number of bishops, who might
      be saved, bore a very small proportion to those who would be
      damned.]

      This ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by Theophilus, 47
      archbishop of Alexandria, an active and ambitious prelate, who
      displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation. His
      national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded
      him from the second to the third rank in the Christian world, was
      exasperated by some personal dispute with Chrysostom himself. 48
      By the private invitation of the empress, Theophilus landed at
      Constantinople with a stou body of Egyptian mariners, to
      encounter the populace; and a train of dependent bishops, to
      secure, by their voices, the majority of a synod. The synod 49
      was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, where
      Rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery; and their
      proceedings were continued during fourteen days, or sessions. A
      bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantinople; but
      the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty-seven articles
      which they presented against him, may justly be considered as a
      fair and unexceptional panegyric. Four successive summons were
      signified to Chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his
      person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies,
      who, prudently declining the examination of any particular
      charges, condemned his contumacious disobedience, and hastily
      pronounced a sentence of deposition. The synod of the Oak
      immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their
      judgment, and charitably insinuated, that the penalties of
      treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher, who had
      reviled, under the name of Jezebel, the empress Eudoxia herself.
      The archbishop was rudely arrested, and conducted through the
      city, by one of the Imperial messengers, who landed him, after a
      short navigation, near the entrance of the Euxine; from whence,
      before the expiration of two days, he was gloriously recalled.

      whom twenty-nine were Egyptians. Forty-five bishops subscribed
      his sentence. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xi. p. 595. *

      The first astonishment of his faithful people had been mute and
      passive: they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury.
      Theophilus escaped, but the promiscuous crowd of monks and
      Egyptian mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of
      Constantinople. 50 A seasonable earthquake justified the
      interposition of Heaven; the torrent of sedition rolled forwards
      to the gates of the palace; and the empress, agitated by fear or
      remorse, threw herself at the feet of Arcadius, and confessed
      that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration
      of Chrysostom. The Bosphorus was covered with innumerable
      vessels; the shores of Europe and Asia were profusely
      illuminated; and the acclamations of a victorious people
      accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the
      archbishop; who, too easily, consented to resume the exercise of
      his functions, before his sentence had been legally reversed by
      the authority of an ecclesiastical synod. Ignorant, or careless,
      of the impending danger, Chrysostom indulged his zeal, or perhaps
      his resentment; declaimed with peculiar asperity against female
      vices; and condemned the profane honors which were addressed,
      almost in the precincts of St. Sophia, to the statue of the
      empress. His imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the
      haughty spirit of Eudoxia, by reporting, or perhaps inventing,
      the famous exordium of a sermon, “Herodias is again furious;
      Herodias again dances; she once more requires the head of John;”
      an insolent allusion, which, as a woman and a sovereign, it was
      impossible for her to forgive. 51 The short interval of a
      perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures
      for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop. A numerous council
      of the Eastern prelates, who were guided from a distance by the
      advice of Theophilus, confirmed the validity, without examining
      the justice, of the former sentence; and a detachment of
      Barbarian troops was introduced into the city, to suppress the
      emotions of the people. On the vigil of Easter, the solemn
      administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers,
      who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens, and violated,
      by their presence, the awful mysteries of the Christian worship.
      Arsacius occupied the church of St. Sophia, and the
      archiepiscopal throne. The Catholics retreated to the baths of
      Constantine, and afterwards to the fields; where they were still
      pursued and insulted by the guards, the bishops, and the
      magistrates. The fatal day of the second and final exile of
      Chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral, of
      the senate-house, and of the adjacent buildings; and this
      calamity was imputed, without proof, but not without probability,
      to the despair of a persecuted faction. 52

      Chronicle, (p. 307.)]

      Cicero might claim some merit, if his voluntary banishment
      preserved the peace of the republic; 53 but the submission of
      Chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a Christian and a
      subject. Instead of listening to his humble prayer, that he might
      be permitted to reside at Cyzicus, or Nicomedia, the inflexible
      empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of
      Cucusus, among the ridges of Mount Taurus, in the Lesser Armenia.
      A secret hope was entertained, that the archbishop might perish
      in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days, in the heat
      of summer, through the provinces of Asia Minor, where he was
      continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the Isaurians,
      and the more implacable fury of the monks. Yet Chrysostom arrived
      in safety at the place of his confinement; and the three years
      which he spent at Cucusus, and the neighboring town of Arabissus,
      were the last and most glorious of his life. His character was
      consecrated by absence and persecution; the faults of his
      administration were no longer remembered; but every tongue
      repeated the praises of his genius and virtue: and the respectful
      attention of the Christian world was fixed on a desert spot among
      the mountains of Taurus. From that solitude the archbishop, whose
      active mind was invigorated by misfortunes, maintained a strict
      and frequent correspondence 54 with the most distant provinces;
      exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to
      persevere in their allegiance; urged the destruction of the
      temples of Phoenicia, and the extirpation of heresy in the Isle
      of Cyprus; extended his pastoral care to the missions of Persia
      and Scythia; negotiated, by his ambassadors, with the Roman
      pontiff and the emperor Honorius; and boldly appealed, from a
      partial synod, to the supreme tribunal of a free and general
      council. The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent;
      but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the
      oppressors, who continued to abuse the name and authority of
      Arcadius. 55 An order was despatched for the instant removal of
      Chrysostom to the extreme desert of Pityus: and his guards so
      faithfully obeyed their cruel instructions, that, before he
      reached the sea-coast of the Euxine, he expired at Comana, in
      Pontus, in the sixtieth year of his age. The succeeding
      generation acknowledged his innocence and merit. The archbishops
      of the East, who might blush that their predecessors had been the
      enemies of Chrysostom, were gradually disposed, by the firmness
      of the Roman pontiff, to restore the honors of that venerable
      name. 56 At the pious solicitation of the clergy and people of
      Constantinople, his relics, thirty years after his death, were
      transported from their obscure sepulchre to the royal city. 57
      The emperor Theodosius advanced to receive them as far as
      Chalcedon; and, falling prostrate on the coffin, implored, in the
      name of his guilty parents, Arcadius and Eudoxia, the forgiveness
      of the injured saint. 58

      III.

      Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained, whether any stain of
      hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor.
      Eudoxia was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her
      passions, and despised her husband; Count John enjoyed, at least,
      the familiar confidence of the empress; and the public named him
      as the real father of Theodosius the younger. 59 The birth of a
      son was accepted, however, by the pious husband, as an event the
      most fortunate and honorable to himself, to his family, and to
      the Eastern world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented
      favor, was invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus. In
      less than four years afterwards, Eudoxia, in the bloom of youth,
      was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage; and this
      untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop, 60 who,
      amidst the universal joy, had ventured to foretell, that she
      should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son.
      The Catholics applauded the justice of Heaven, which avenged the
      persecution of St. Chrysostom; and perhaps the emperor was the
      only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and
      rapacious Eudoxia. Such a domestic misfortune afflicted him more
      deeply than the public calamities of the East; 61 the licentious
      excursions, from Pontus to Palestine, of the Isaurian robbers,
      whose impunity accused the weakness of the government; and the
      earthquakes, the conflagrations, the famine, and the flights of
      locusts, 62 which the popular discontent was equally disposed to
      attribute to the incapacity of the monarch. At length, in the
      thirty-first year of his age, after a reign (if we may abuse that
      word) of thirteen years, three months, and fifteen days, Arcadius
      expired in the palace of Constantinople. It is impossible to
      delineate his character; since, in a period very copiously
      furnished with historical materials, it has not been possible to
      remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great
      Theodosius.

      The historian Procopius 63 has indeed illuminated the mind of the
      dying emperor with a ray of human prudence, or celestial wisdom.
      Arcadius considered, with anxious foresight, the helpless
      condition of his son Theodosius, who was no more than seven years
      of age, the dangerous factions of a minority, and the aspiring
      spirit of Jezdegerd, the Persian monarch. Instead of tempting the
      allegiance of an ambitious subject, by the participation of
      supreme power, he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king;
      and placed, by a solemn testament, the sceptre of the East in the
      hands of Jezdegerd himself. The royal guardian accepted and
      discharged this honorable trust with unexampled fidelity; and the
      infancy of Theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of
      Persia. Such is the singular narrative of Procopius; and his
      veracity is not disputed by Agathias, 64 while he presumes to
      dissent from his judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a
      Christian emperor, who, so rashly, though so fortunately,
      committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a
      stranger, a rival, and a heathen. At the distance of one hundred
      and fifty years, this political question might be debated in the
      court of Justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to
      examine the propriety, till he has ascertained the truth, of the
      testament of Arcadius. As it stands without a parallel in the
      history of the world, we may justly require, that it should be
      attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of
      contemporaries. The strange novelty of the event, which excites
      our distrust, must have attracted their notice; and their
      universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the
      succeeding age.

      The maxims of Roman jurisprudence, if they could fairly be
      transferred from private property to public dominion, would have
      adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew,
      till he had attained, at least, the fourteenth year of his age.
      But the weakness of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign,
      disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim; and such
      was the absolute separation of the two monarchies, both in
      interest and affection, that Constantinople would have obeyed,
      with less reluctance, the orders of the Persian, than those of
      the Italian, court. Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by
      the external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless
      favorites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace; and
      dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master, whom
      they direct and despise. But the ministers of a child, who is
      incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name,
      must acquire and exercise an independent authority. The great
      officers of the state and army, who had been appointed before the
      death of Arcadius, formed an aristocracy, which might have
      inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the
      government of the Eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the
      præfect Anthemius, 65 who obtained, by his superior abilities, a
      lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals. The safety of the
      young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius; and
      his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an
      infant reign. Uldin, with a formidable host of Barbarians, was
      encamped in the heart of Thrace; he proudly rejected all terms of
      accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the
      Roman ambassadors, that the course of that planet should alone
      terminate the conquest of the Huns. But the desertion of his
      confederates, who were privately convinced of the justice and
      liberality of the Imperial ministers, obliged Uldin to repass the
      Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri, which composed his rear-guard,
      was almost extirpated; and many thousand captives were dispersed
      to cultivate, with servile labor, the fields of Asia. 66 In the
      midst of the public triumph, Constantinople was protected by a
      strong enclosure of new and more extensive walls; the same
      vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the
      Illyrian cities; and a plan was judiciously conceived, which, in

      But the Romans had so long been accustomed to the authority of a
      monarch, that the first, even among the females, of the Imperial
      family, who displayed any courage or capacity, was permitted to
      ascend the vacant throne of Theodosius. His sister Pulcheria, 68
      who was only two years older than himself, received, at the age
      of sixteen, the title of Augusta; and though her favor might be
      sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, she continued to govern
      the Eastern empire near forty years; during the long minority of
      her brother, and after his death, in her own name, and in the
      name of Marcian, her nominal husband. From a motive either of
      prudence or religion, she embraced a life of celibacy; and
      notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of Pulcheria, 69
      this resolution, which she communicated to her sisters Arcadia
      and Marina, was celebrated by the Christian world, as the sublime
      effort of heroic piety. In the presence of the clergy and people,
      the three daughters of Arcadius 70 dedicated their virginity to
      God; and the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a
      tablet of gold and gems; which they publicly offered in the great
      church of Constantinople. Their palace was converted into a
      monastery; and all males, except the guides of their conscience,
      the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes, were
      scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold. Pulcheria, her two
      sisters, and a chosen train of favorite damsels, formed a
      religious community: they denounced the vanity of dress;
      interrupted, by frequent fasts, their simple and frugal diet;
      allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery; and
      devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of
      prayer and psalmody. The piety of a Christian virgin was adorned
      by the zeal and liberality of an empress. Ecclesiastical history
      describes the splendid churches, which were built at the expense
      of Pulcheria, in all the provinces of the East; her charitable
      foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the ample
      donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of
      monastic societies; and the active severity with which she
      labored to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and
      Eutyches. Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar
      favor of the Deity: and the relics of martyrs, as well as the
      knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and
      revelations to the Imperial saint. 71 Yet the devotion of
      Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from
      temporal affairs; and she alone, among all the descendants of the
      great Theodosius, appears to have inherited any share of his
      manly spirit and abilities. The elegant and familiar use which
      she had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin languages, was
      readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing,
      on public business: her deliberations were maturely weighed; her
      actions were prompt and decisive; and, while she moved, without
      noise or ostentation, the wheel of government, she discreetly
      attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of
      his reign. In the last years of his peaceful life, Europe was
      indeed afflicted by the arms of war; but the more extensive
      provinces of Asia still continued to enjoy a profound and
      permanent repose. Theodosius the younger was never reduced to the
      disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious
      subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigor, some praise may
      be due to the mildness and prosperity, of the administration of
      Pulcheria.

      to a church of St. Thyrsus, erected by Caesarius, who was consul
      A.D. 397; and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated.
      Notwithstanding the charitable wishes of Dr. Jortin, (Remarks,
      tom. iv. p. 234,) it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some
      share in the pious fraud; which must have been transacted when
      she was more than five-and-thirty years of age.]

      The Roman world was deeply interested in the education of its
      master. A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously
      instituted; of the military exercises of riding, and shooting
      with the bow; of the liberal studies of grammar, rhetoric, and
      philosophy: the most skilful masters of the East ambitiously
      solicited the attention of their royal pupil; and several noble
      youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his diligence
      by the emulation of friendship. Pulcheria alone discharged the
      important task of instructing her brother in the arts of
      government; but her precepts may countenance some suspicions of
      the extent of her capacity, or of the purity of her intentions.
      She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment; to
      walk, to hold his robes, to seat himself on his throne, in a
      manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain from laughter; to
      listen with condescension; to return suitable answers; to assume,
      by turns, a serious or a placid countenance: in a word, to
      represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman
      emperor. But Theodosius 72 was never excited to support the
      weight and glory of an illustrious name: and, instead of aspiring
      to support his ancestors, he degenerated (if we may presume to
      measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his
      father and his uncle. Arcadius and Honorius had been assisted by
      the guardian care of a parent, whose lessons were enforced by his
      authority and example. But the unfortunate prince, who is born in
      the purple, must remain a stranger to the voice of truth; and the
      son of Arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy
      encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs. The
      ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential
      duties of his high office, was filled by idle amusements and
      unprofitable studies. Hunting was the only active pursuit that
      could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most
      assiduously labored, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp,
      in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the
      elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the
      Roman emperor to the singular epithet of Calligraphes, or a fair
      writer. Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil,
      Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved; he loved those who
      were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence; and as he
      never perused the papers that were presented for the royal
      signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his
      character were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor
      himself was chaste, temperate, liberal, and merciful; but these
      qualities, which can only deserve the name of virtues when they
      are supported by courage and regulated by discretion, were seldom
      beneficial, and they sometimes proved mischievous, to mankind.
      His mind, enervated by a royal education, was oppressed and
      degraded by abject superstition: he fasted, he sung psalms, he
      blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith
      was continually nourished. Theodosius devoutly worshipped the
      dead and living saints of the Catholic church; and he once
      refused to eat, till an insolent monk, who had cast an
      excommunication on his sovereign, condescended to heal the
      spiritual wound which he had inflicted. 73

      72 (return) [ There is a remarkable difference between the two
      ecclesiastical historians, who in general bear so close a
      resemblance. Sozomen (l. ix. c. 1) ascribes to Pulcheria the
      government of the empire, and the education of her brother, whom
      he scarcely condescends to praise. Socrates, though he affectedly
      disclaims all hopes of favor or fame, composes an elaborate
      panegyric on the emperor, and cautiously suppresses the merits of
      his sister, (l. vii. c. 22, 42.) Philostorgius (l. xii. c. 7)
      expresses the influence of Pulcheria in gentle and courtly
      language. Suidas (Excerpt. p. 53) gives a true character of
      Theodosius; and I have followed the example of Tillemont (tom.
      vi. p. 25) in borrowing some strokes from the modern Greeks.]

      The story of a fair and virtuous maiden, exalted from a private
      condition to the Imperial throne, might be deemed an incredible
      romance, if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage
      of Theodosius. The celebrated Athenais 74 was educated by her
      father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks; and
      so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher
      entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his patrimony
      between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy
      of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her
      beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. The jealousy and
      avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge
      at Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or
      favor, to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria. That sagacious
      princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly
      destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius for the future
      wife of the emperor of the East, who had now attained the
      twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the curiosity of
      her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais;
      large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden
      locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding
      improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress. Theodosius,
      concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was
      permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth
      immediately declared his pure and honorable love; and the royal
      nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital
      and the provinces. Athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce
      the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism the Christian
      name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of
      Augusta, till the wife of Theodosius had approved her
      fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen
      years afterwards, the emperor of the West. The brothers of
      Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but as
      she could easily forgive their unfortunate unkindness, she
      indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by
      promoting them to the rank of consuls and præfects. In the
      luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those ingenuous arts
      which had contributed to her greatness; and wisely dedicated her
      talents to the honor of religion, and of her husband. Eudocia
      composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the
      Old Testament, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zechariah; a
      cento of the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of
      Christ, the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian
      victories of Theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded
      by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by
      the candor of impartial criticism. 75 The fondness of the emperor
      was not abated by time and possession; and Eudocia, after the
      marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful
      vows by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Her ostentatious
      progress through the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit
      of Christian humility; she pronounced, from a throne of gold and
      gems, an eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch, declared her
      royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, bestowed a
      donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public
      baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed by the
      gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious
      foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena, and
      though the public treasure might be impoverished by this
      excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of
      returning to Constantinople with the chains of St. Peter, the
      right arm of St. Stephen, and an undoubted picture of the Virgin,
      painted by St. Luke. 76 But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of
      the glories of Eudocia. Satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful,
      perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired
      to the government of the Eastern empire; the palace was
      distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last
      decided, by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius.
      The execution of Paulinus, master of the offices, and the
      disgrace of Cyrus, Prætorian præfect of the East, convinced the
      public that the favor of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her
      most faithful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus
      encouraged the secret rumor, that his guilt was that of a
      successful lover. 77 As soon as the empress perceived that the
      affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost, she requested the
      permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem. She
      obtained her request; but the jealousy of Theodosius, or the
      vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat;
      and Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish
      with death two ecclesiastics, her most favored servants. Eudocia
      instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count; the
      furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion,
      seemed to justify the severity of Theodosius; and the empress,
      ignominiously stripped of the honors of her rank, 78 was
      disgraced, perhaps unjustly, in the eyes of the world. The
      remainder of the life of Eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent
      in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of
      Theodosius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a
      captive from Rome to Carthage, and the society of the Holy Monks
      of Palestine, insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her
      mind. After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life,
      the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired, at Jerusalem,
      in the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting, with her dying
      breath, that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence
      and friendship. 79

      74 (return) [ Socrates (l. vii. c. 21) mentions her name,

      Venet. 1743) and in the Paschal Chronicle, (p. 311, 312.) Those
      authors had probably seen original pictures of the empress
      Eudocia. The modern Greeks, Zonaras, Cedrenus, &c., have
      displayed the love, rather than the talent of fiction. From
      Nicephorus, indeed, I have ventured to assume her age. The writer
      of a romance would not have imagined, that Athenais was near
      twenty eight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young

      history of Antioch, John Malala becomes a writer of good
      authority. The Abbe Guenee, in a memoir on the fertility of
      Palestine, of which I have only seen an extract, calculates the
      gifts of Eudocia at 20,488 pounds of gold, above 800,000 pounds
      sterling.]

      The gentle mind of Theodosius was never inflamed by the ambition
      of conquest, or military renown; and the slight alarm of a
      Persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East.
      The motives of this war were just and honorable. In the last year
      of the reign of Jezdegerd, the supposed guardian of Theodosius, a
      bishop, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom, destroyed one of
      the fire-temples of Susa. 80 His zeal and obstinacy were revenged
      on his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel persecution; and the
      intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Varanes, or
      Bahram, who soon afterwards ascended the throne. Some Christian
      fugitives, who escaped to the Roman frontier, were sternly
      demanded, and generously refused; and the refusal, aggravated by
      commercial disputes, soon kindled a war between the rival
      monarchies. The mountains of Armenia, and the plains of
      Mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations
      of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive
      or memorable events. Some engagements were fought, some towns
      were besieged, with various and doubtful success: and if the
      Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long-lost
      possession of Nisibis, the Persians were repulsed from the walls
      of a Mesopotamian city, by the valor of a martial bishop, who
      pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the
      Apostle. Yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of
      the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of
      Constantinople, were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.
      From these panegyrics the historians 81 of the age might borrow
      their extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous tales; of the proud
      challenge of a Persian hero, who was entangled by the net, and
      despatched by the sword, of Areobindus the Goth; of the ten
      thousand Immortals, who were slain in the attack of the Roman
      camp; and of the hundred thousand Arabs, or Saracens, who were
      impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the
      Euphrates. Such events may be disbelieved or disregarded; but the
      charity of a bishop, Acacius of Amida, whose name might have
      dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in oblivion.
      Boldly declaring, that vases of gold and silver are useless to a
      God who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the
      plate of the church of Amida; employed the price in the
      redemption of seven thousand Persian captives; supplied their
      wants with affectionate liberality; and dismissed them to their
      native country, to inform their king of the true spirit of the
      religion which he persecuted. The practice of benevolence in the
      midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of
      contending nations; and I wish to persuade myself, that Acacius
      contributed to the restoration of peace. In the conference which
      was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman ambassadors
      degraded the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain
      attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they seriously
      advised the Persians to prevent, by a timely accommodation, the
      wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this distant war. A
      truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified; and although
      the revolutions of Armenia might threaten the public
      tranquillity, the essential conditions of this treaty were
      respected near fourscore years by the successors of Constantine
      and Artaxerxes.

      Since the Roman and Parthian standards first encountered on the
      banks of the Euphrates, the kingdom of Armenia 82 was alternately
      oppressed by its formidable protectors; and in the course of this
      History, several events, which inclined the balance of peace and
      war, have been already related. A disgraceful treaty had resigned
      Armenia to the ambition of Sapor; and the scale of Persia
      appeared to preponderate. But the royal race of Arsaces
      impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the turbulent
      nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence; and
      the nation was still attached to the Christian princes of
      Constantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia
      was divided by the progress of war and faction; 83 and the
      unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient
      monarchy. Chosroes, the Persian vassal, reigned over the Eastern
      and most extensive portion of the country; while the Western
      province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and the
      supremacy of the emperor Arcadius. 8111 After the death of
      Arsaces, the Romans suppressed the regal government, and imposed
      on their allies the condition of subjects. The military command
      was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier; the city of
      Theodosiopolis 84 was built and fortified in a strong situation,
      on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the Euphrates;
      and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps, whose
      dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The
      less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and
      envied the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate
      their peace and pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with
      their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes
      8411 for their lawful sovereign. About thirty years afterwards,
      Artasires, the nephew and successor of Chosroes, fell under the
      displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia; and
      they unanimously desired a Persian governor in the room of an
      unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose sanction
      they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a
      superstitious people. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable
      vices of Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to
      accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would
      punish, without destroying, the sinner. “Our king,” continued
      Isaac, “is too much addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has
      been purified in the holy waters of baptism. He is a lover of
      women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. He may
      deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted
      Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are
      flagitious. I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage
      of devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange
      of the infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a
      heathen.” 85 Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac, the factious
      nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret
      adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence
      of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly
      pronounced by Bahram himself. The descendants of Arsaces were
      degraded from the royal dignity, 86 which they had possessed
      above five hundred and sixty years; 87 and the dominions of the
      unfortunate Artasires, 8711 under the new and significant
      appellation of Persarmenia, were reduced into the form of a
      province. This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman
      government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an
      amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of
      Armenia: 8712 and a territorial acquisition, which Augustus might
      have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of
      the younger Theodosius.

      Chapter XXXIII: Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals.—Part I.

     Death Of Honorius.—Valentinian III.—Emperor Of The East.
     —Administration Of His Mother Placidia—Ætius And
     Boniface.—Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals.

      During a long and disgraceful reign of twenty-eight years,
      Honorius, emperor of the West, was separated from the friendship
      of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over
      the East; and Constantinople beheld, with apparent indifference
      and secret joy, the calamities of Rome. The strange adventures of
      Placidia 1 gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two
      empires. The daughter of the great Theodosius had been the
      captive, and the queen, of the Goths; she lost an affectionate
      husband; she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin; she
      tasted the pleasure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty
      of peace, for six hundred thousand measures of wheat. After her
      return from Spain to Italy, Placidia experienced a new
      persecution in the bosom of her family. She was averse to a
      marriage, which had been stipulated without her consent; and the
      brave Constantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had
      vanquished, received, from the hand of Honorius himself, the
      struggling and the reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus. But
      her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials: nor did
      Placidia refuse to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian
      the Third, or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over
      the mind of her grateful husband. The generous soldier, whose
      time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and
      military service, was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition:
      he extorted the title of Augustus: and the servant of Honorius
      was associated to the empire of the West. The death of
      Constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of
      diminishing, seemed to inerease the power of Placidia; and the
      indecent familiarity 2 of her brother, which might be no more
      than the symptoms of a childish affection, were universally
      attributed to incestuous love. On a sudden, by some base
      intrigues of a steward and a nurse, this excessive fondness was
      converted into an irreconcilable quarrel: the debates of the
      emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of
      the palace; and as the Gothic soldiers adhered to their queen,
      the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous
      tumults, which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary
      retreat of Placidia and her children. The royal exiles landed at
      Constantinople, soon after the marriage of Theodosius, during the
      festival of the Persian victories. They were treated with
      kindness and magnificence; but as the statues of the emperor
      Constantius had been rejected by the Eastern court, the title of
      Augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow. Within a few
      months after the arrival of Placidia, a swift messenger announced
      the death of Honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the
      important secret was not divulged, till the necessary orders had
      been despatched for the march of a large body of troops to the
      sea-coast of Dalmatia. The shops and the gates of Constantinople
      remained shut during seven days; and the loss of a foreign
      prince, who could neither be esteemed nor regretted, was
      celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public
      grief.

      2 (return) [ It is the expression of Olympiodorus (apud Phetium
      p. 197;) who means, perhaps, to describe the same caresses which

      prophet himself,) quando subit mihi desiderium Paradisi, osculor

      has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Father
      Maracci in his Version and Confutation of the Koran, tom. i. p.
      32.]

      While the ministers of Constantinople deliberated, the vacant
      throne of Honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger. The
      name of the rebel was John; he filled the confidential office of
      Primicerius, or principal secretary, and history has attributed
      to his character more virtues, than can easily be reconciled with
      the violation of the most sacred duty. Elated by the submission
      of Italy, and the hope of an alliance with the Huns, John
      presumed to insult, by an embassy, the majesty of the Eastern
      emperor; but when he understood that his agents had been
      banished, imprisoned, and at length chased away with deserved
      ignominy, John prepared to assert, by arms, the injustice of his
      claims. In such a cause, the grandson of the great Theodosius
      should have marched in person: but the young emperor was easily
      diverted, by his physicians, from so rash and hazardous a design;
      and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently intrusted
      to Ardaburius, and his son Aspar, who had already signalized
      their valor against the Persians. It was resolved, that
      Ardaburius should embark with the infantry; whilst Aspar, at the
      head of the cavalry, conducted Placidia and her son Valentinian
      along the sea-coast of the Adriatic. The march of the cavalry was
      performed with such active diligence, that they surprised,
      without resistance, the important city of Aquileia: when the
      hopes of Aspar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence,
      that a storm had dispersed the Imperial fleet; and that his
      father, with only two galleys, was taken and carried a prisoner
      into the port of Ravenna. Yet this incident, unfortunate as it
      might seem, facilitated the conquest of Italy. Ardaburius
      employed, or abused, the courteous freedom which he was permitted
      to enjoy, to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and
      gratitude; and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution,
      he invited, by private messages, and pressed the approach of,
      Aspar. A shepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an
      angel, guided the eastern cavalry by a secret, and, it was
      thought, an impassable road, through the morasses of the Po: the
      gates of Ravenna, after a short struggle, were thrown open; and
      the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to
      the cruelty, of the conquerors. His right hand was first cut off;
      and, after he had been exposed, mounted on an ass, to the public
      derision, John was beheaded in the circus of Aquileia. The
      emperor Theodosius, when he received the news of the victory,
      interrupted the horse-races; and singing, as he marched through
      the streets, a suitable psalm, conducted his people from the
      Hippodrome to the church, where he spent the remainder of the day
      in grateful devotion. 3

      In a monarchy, which, according to various precedents, might be
      considered as elective, or hereditary, or patrimonial, it was
      impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral
      succession should be clearly defined; 4 and Theodosius, by the
      right of consanguinity or conquest, might have reigned the sole
      legitimate emperor of the Romans. For a moment, perhaps, his eyes
      were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway; but his indolent
      temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy. He
      contented himself with the possession of the East; and wisely
      relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful
      war against the Barbarians beyond the Alps; or of securing the
      obedience of the Italians and Africans, whose minds were
      alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and
      interest. Instead of listening to the voice of ambition,
      Theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather,
      and to seat his cousin Valentinian on the throne of the West. The
      royal infant was distinguished at Constantinople by the title of
      Nobilissimus: he was promoted, before his departure from
      Thessalonica, to the rank and dignity of Caesar; and after the
      conquest of Italy, the patrician Helion, by the authority of
      Theodosius, and in the presence of the senate, saluted
      Valentinian the Third by the name of Augustus, and solemnly
      invested him with the diadem and the Imperial purple. 5 By the
      agreement of the three females who governed the Roman world, the
      son of Placidia was betrothed to Eudoxia, the daughter of
      Theodosius and Athenais; and as soon as the lover and his bride
      had attained the age of puberty, this honorable alliance was
      faithfully accomplished. At the same time, as a compensation,
      perhaps, for the expenses of the war, the Western Illyricum was
      detached from the Italian dominions, and yielded to the throne of
      Constantinople. 6 The emperor of the East acquired the useful
      dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia, and the
      dangerous sovereignty of Pannonia and Noricum, which had been
      filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of
      Huns, Ostrogoths, Vandals, and Bavarians. Theodosius and
      Valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public
      and domestic alliance; but the unity of the Roman government was
      finally dissolved. By a positive declaration, the validity of all
      future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar
      author; unless he should think proper to communicate them,
      subscribed with his own hand, for the approbation of his
      independent colleague. 7

      ratifies and communicates (A.D. 438) the Theodosian Code. About
      forty years before that time, the unity of legislation had been
      proved by an exception. The Jews, who were numerous in the cities
      of Apulia and Calabria, produced a law of the East to justify
      their exemption from municipal offices, (Cod. Theod. l. xvi. tit.
      viii. leg. 13;) and the Western emperor was obliged to
      invalidate, by a special edict, the law, quam constat meis
      partibus esse damnosam. Cod. Theod. l. xi. tit. i. leg. 158.]

      Valentinian, when he received the title of Augustus, was no more
      than six years of age; and his long minority was intrusted to the
      guardian care of a mother, who might assert a female claim to the
      succession of the Western empire. Placidia envied, but she could
      not equal, the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of
      Theodosius, the elegant genius of Eudocia, the wise and
      successful policy of Pulcheria. The mother of Valentinian was
      jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising; 8 she
      reigned twenty-five years, in the name of her son; and the
      character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the
      suspicion that Placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute
      education, and studiously diverted his attention from every manly
      and honorable pursuit. Amidst the decay of military spirit, her
      armies were commanded by two generals, Ætius 9 and Boniface, 10
      who may be deservedly named as the last of the Romans. Their
      union might have supported a sinking empire; their discord was
      the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa. The invasion
      and defeat of Attila have immortalized the fame of Ætius; and
      though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival,
      the defence of Marseilles, and the deliverance of Africa, attest
      the military talents of Count Boniface. In the field of battle,
      in partial encounters, in single combats, he was still the terror
      of the Barbarians: the clergy, and particularly his friend
      Augustin, were edified by the Christian piety which had once
      tempted him to retire from the world; the people applauded his
      spotless integrity; the army dreaded his equal and inexorable
      justice, which may be displayed in a very singular example. A
      peasant, who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife
      and a Gothic soldier, was directed to attend his tribunal the
      following day: in the evening the count, who had diligently
      informed himself of the time and place of the assignation,
      mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the country, surprised the
      guilty couple, punished the soldier with instant death, and
      silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him, the
      next morning, with the head of the adulterer. The abilities of
      Ætius and Boniface might have been usefully employed against the
      public enemies, in separate and important commands; but the
      experience of their past conduct should have decided the real
      favor and confidence of the empress Placidia. In the melancholy
      season of her exile and distress, Boniface alone had maintained
      her cause with unshaken fidelity: and the troops and treasures of
      Africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion.
      The same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of
      Ætius, who brought an army of sixty thousand Huns from the
      Danube to the confines of Italy, for the service of the usurper.
      The untimely death of John compelled him to accept an
      advantageous treaty; but he still continued, the subject and the
      soldier of Valentinian, to entertain a secret, perhaps a
      treasonable, correspondence with his Barbarian allies, whose
      retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts, and more liberal
      promises. But Ætius possessed an advantage of singular moment in
      a female reign; he was present: he besieged, with artful and
      assiduous flattery, the palace of Ravenna; disguised his dark
      designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship; and at length
      deceived both his mistress and his absent rival, by a subtle
      conspiracy, which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily
      suspect. He had secretly persuaded 11 Placidia to recall Boniface
      from the government of Africa; he secretly advised Boniface to
      disobey the Imperial summons: to the one, he represented the
      order as a sentence of death; to the other, he stated the refusal
      as a signal of revolt; and when the credulous and unsuspectful
      count had armed the province in his defence, Ætius applauded his
      sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion, which his own perfidy had
      excited. A temperate inquiry into the real motives of Boniface
      would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the
      republic; but the arts of Ætius still continued to betray and to
      inflame, and the count was urged, by persecution, to embrace the
      most desperate counsels. The success with which he eluded or
      repelled the first attacks, could not inspire a vain confidence,
      that at the head of some loose, disorderly Africans, he should be
      able to withstand the regular forces of the West, commanded by a
      rival, whose military character it was impossible for him to
      despise. After some hesitation, the last struggles of prudence

      rather to the camp, of Gonderic, king of the Vandals, with the
      proposal of a strict alliance, and the offer of an advantageous
      and perpetual settlement.

      After the retreat of the Goths, the authority of Honorius had
      obtained a precarious establishment in Spain; except only in the
      province of Gallicia, where the Suevi and the Vandals had
      fortified their camps, in mutual discord and hostile
      independence. The Vandals prevailed; and their adversaries were
      besieged in the Nervasian hills, between Leon and Oviedo, till
      the approach of Count Asterius compelled, or rather provoked, the
      victorious Barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the
      plains of Boetica. The rapid progress of the Vandals soon
      acquired a more effectual opposition; and the master-general
      Castinus marched against them with a numerous army of Romans and
      Goths. Vanquished in battle by an inferior army, Castinus fled
      with dishonor to Tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has
      been represented as the punishment, was most probably the effect,
      of his rash presumption. 12 Seville and Carthagena became the
      reward, or rather the prey, of the ferocious conquerors; and the
      vessels which they found in the harbor of Carthagena might easily
      transport them to the Isles of Majorca and Minorca, where the
      Spanish fugitives, as in a secure recess, had vainly concealed
      their families and their fortunes. The experience of navigation,
      and perhaps the prospect of Africa, encouraged the Vandals to
      accept the invitation which they received from Count Boniface;
      and the death of Gonderic served only to forward and animate the
      bold enterprise. In the room of a prince not conspicuous for any
      superior powers of the mind or body, they acquired his bastard
      brother, the terrible Genseric; 13 a name, which, in the
      destruction of the Roman empire, has deserved an equal rank with
      the names of Alaric and Attila. The king of the Vandals is
      described to have been of a middle stature, with a lameness in
      one leg, which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his
      horse. His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep
      purposes of his soul; he disdained to imitate the luxury of the
      vanquished; but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and
      revenge. The ambition of Genseric was without bounds and without
      scruples; and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark
      engines of policy to solicit the allies who might be useful to
      his success, or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred
      and contention. Almost in the moment of his departure he was
      informed that Hermanric, king of the Suevi, had presumed to
      ravage the Spanish territories, which he was resolved to abandon.

      Impatient of the insult, Genseric pursued the hasty retreat of
      the Suevi as far as Merida; precipitated the king and his army
      into the River Anas, and calmly returned to the sea-shore to
      embark his victorious troops. The vessels which transported the
      Vandals over the modern Straits of Gibraltar, a channel only
      twelve miles in breadth, were furnished by the Spaniards, who
      anxiously wished their departure; and by the African general, who
      had implored their formidable assistance. 14

      prayed, they carried a Bible in the front of the Host, with the
      design, perhaps, of reproaching the perfidy and sacrilege of
      their enemies.]

      Our fancy, so long accustomed to exaggerate and multiply the
      martial swarms of Barbarians that seemed to issue from the North,
      will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which
      Genseric mustered on the coast of Mauritania. The Vandals, who in
      twenty years had penetrated from the Elbe to Mount Atlas, were
      united under the command of their warlike king; and he reigned
      with equal authority over the Alani, who had passed, within the
      term of human life, from the cold of Scythia to the excessive
      heat of an African climate. The hopes of the bold enterprise had
      excited many brave adventurers of the Gothic nation; and many
      desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes by
      the same means which had occasioned their ruin. Yet this various
      multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men; and
      though Genseric artfully magnified his apparent strength, by
      appointing eighty chinarchs, or commanders of thousands, the
      fallacious increase of old men, of children, and of slaves, would
      scarcely have swelled his army to the number of four-score
      thousand persons. 15 But his own dexterity, and the discontents
      of Africa, soon fortified the Vandal powers, by the accession of
      numerous and active allies. The parts of Mauritania which border
      on the Great Desert and the Atlantic Ocean, were filled with a
      fierce and untractable race of men, whose savage temper had been
      exasperated, rather than reclaimed, by their dread of the Roman
      arms. The wandering Moors, 16 as they gradually ventured to
      approach the seashore, and the camp of the Vandals, must have
      viewed with terror and astonishment the dress, the armor, the
      martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had
      landed on their coast; and the fair complexions of the blue-eyed
      warriors of Germany formed a very singular contrast with the
      swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighborhood of
      the torrid zone. After the first difficulties had in some measure
      been removed, which arose from the mutual ignorance of their
      respective language, the Moors, regardless of any future
      consequence, embraced the alliance of the enemies of Rome; and a
      crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and valleys of Mount
      Atlas, to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants, who had
      injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the
      land.

      embrace any uniform system of policy.]

      The persecution of the Donatists 17 was an event not less
      favorable to the designs of Genseric. Seventeen years before he
      landed in Africa, a public conference was held at Carthage, by
      the order of the magistrate. The Catholics were satisfied, that,
      after the invincible reasons which they had alleged, the
      obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary;
      and the emperor Honorius was persuaded to inflict the most
      rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his
      patience and clemency. Three hundred bishops, 18 with many
      thousands of the inferior clergy, were torn from their churches,
      stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions, banished to the
      islands, and proscribed by the laws, if they presumed to conceal
      themselves in the provinces of Africa. Their numerous
      congregations, both in cities and in the country, were deprived
      of the rights of citizens, and of the exercise of religious
      worship. A regular scale of fines, from ten to two hundred pounds
      of silver, was curiously ascertained, according to the
      distinction of rank and fortune, to punish the crime of assisting
      at a schismatic conventicle; and if the fine had been levied five
      times, without subduing the obstinacy of the offender, his future
      punishment was referred to the discretion of the Imperial court.
      19 By these severities, which obtained the warmest approbation of
      St. Augustin, 20 great numbers of Donatists were reconciled to
      the Catholic Church; but the fanatics, who still persevered in
      their opposition, were provoked to madness and despair; the
      distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed; the
      armed troops of Circumcellions alternately pointed their rage
      against themselves, or against their adversaries; and the
      calendar of martyrs received on both sides a considerable
      augmentation. 21 Under these circumstances, Genseric, a
      Christian, but an enemy of the orthodox communion, showed himself
      to the Donatists as a powerful deliverer, from whom they might
      reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts
      of the Roman emperors. 22 The conquest of Africa was facilitated
      by the active zeal, or the secret favor, of a domestic faction;
      the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy of which
      the Vandals are accused, may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism
      of their allies; and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the
      triumph of Christianity, contributed to the loss of the most
      important province of the West. 23

      The court and the people were astonished by the strange
      intelligence, that a virtuous hero, after so many favors, and so
      many services, had renounced his allegiance, and invited the
      Barbarians to destroy the province intrusted to his command. The
      friends of Boniface, who still believed that his criminal
      behavior might be excused by some honorable motive, solicited,
      during the absence of Ætius, a free conference with the Count of
      Africa; and Darius, an officer of high distinction, was named for
      the important embassy. 24 In their first interview at Carthage,
      the imaginary provocations were mutually explained; the opposite
      letters of Ætius were produced and compared; and the fraud was
      easily detected. Placidia and Boniface lamented their fatal
      error; and the count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the
      forgiveness of his sovereign, or to expose his head to her future
      resentment. His repentance was fervent and sincere; but he soon
      discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the
      edifice which he had shaken to its foundations. Carthage and the
      Roman garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of
      Valentinian; but the rest of Africa was still distracted with war
      and faction; and the inexorable king of the Vandals, disdaining
      all terms of accommodation, sternly refused to relinquish the
      possession of his prey. The band of veterans who marched under
      the standard of Boniface, and his hasty levies of provincial
      troops, were defeated with considerable loss; the victorious
      Barbarians insulted the open country; and Carthage, Cirta, and
      Hippo Regius, were the only cities that appeared to rise above
      the general inundation.

      24 (return) [ In a confidential letter to Count Boniface, St.
      Augustin, without examining the grounds of the quarrel, piously
      exhorts him to discharge the duties of a Christian and a subject:
      to extricate himself without delay from his dangerous and guilty
      situation; and even, if he could obtain the consent of his wife,
      to embrace a life of celibacy and penance, (Tillemont, Mem.
      Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 890.) The bishop was intimately connected
      with Darius, the minister of peace, (Id. tom. xiii. p. 928.)]

      The long and narrow tract of the African coast was filled with
      frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence; and the
      respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by
      the distance from Carthage and the Mediterranean. A simple
      reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest
      idea of fertility and cultivation: the country was extremely
      populous; the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for
      their own use; and the annual exportation, particularly of wheat,
      was so regular and plentiful, that Africa deserved the name of
      the common granary of Rome and of mankind. On a sudden the seven
      fruitful provinces, from Tangier to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by
      the invasion of the Vandals; whose destructive rage has perhaps
      been exaggerated by popular animosity, religious zeal, and
      extravagant declamation. War, in its fairest form, implies a
      perpetual violation of humanity and justice; and the hostilities
      of Barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which
      incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society. The
      Vandals, where they found resistance, seldom gave quarter; and
      the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin
      of the cities under whose walls they had fallen. Careless of the
      distinctions of age, or sex, or rank, they employed every species
      of indignity and torture, to force from the captives a discovery
      of their hidden wealth. The stern policy of Genseric justified
      his frequent examples of military execution: he was not always
      the master of his own passions, or of those of his followers; and
      the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of
      the Moors, and the fanaticism of the Donatists. Yet I shall not
      easily be persuaded, that it was the common practice of the
      Vandals to extirpate the olives, and other fruit trees, of a
      country where they intended to settle: nor can I believe that it
      was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their
      prisoners before the walls of a besieged city, for the sole
      purpose of infecting the air, and producing a pestilence, of
      which they themselves must have been the first victims. 25

      The generous mind of Count Boniface was tortured by the exquisite
      distress of beholding the ruin which he had occasioned, and whose
      rapid progress he was unable to check. After the loss of a battle
      he retired into Hippo Regius; where he was immediately besieged
      by an enemy, who considered him as the real bulwark of Africa.
      The maritime colony of Hippo, 26 about two hundred miles westward
      of Carthage, had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of
      Regius, from the residence of Numidian kings; and some remains of
      trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city, which is
      known in Europe by the corrupted name of Bona. The military
      labors, and anxious reflections, of Count Boniface, were
      alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend St.
      Augustin; 27 till that bishop, the light and pillar of the
      Catholic church, was gently released, in the third month of the
      siege, and in the seventy-sixth year of his age, from the actual
      and the impending calamities of his country. The youth of
      Augustin had been stained by the vices and errors which he so
      ingenuously confesses; but from the moment of his conversion to
      that of his death, the manners of the bishop of Hippo were pure
      and austere: and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an
      ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination; the
      Manichæans, the Donatists, and the Pelagians, against whom he
      waged a perpetual controversy. When the city, some months after
      his death, was burnt by the Vandals, the library was fortunately
      saved, which contained his voluminous writings; two hundred and
      thirty-two separate books or treatises on theological subjects,
      besides a complete exposition of the psalter and the gospel, and
      a copious magazine of epistles and homilies. 28 According to the
      judgment of the most impartial critics, the superficial learning
      of Augustin was confined to the Latin language; 29 and his style,
      though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion, is usually
      clouded by false and affected rhetoric. But he possessed a
      strong, capacious, argumentative mind; he boldly sounded the dark
      abyss of grace, predestination, free will, and original sin; and
      the rigid system of Christianity which he framed or restored, 30
      has been entertained, with public applause, and secret
      reluctance, by the Latin church. 31

      Chapter XXXIII: Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals.—Part II.

      By the skill of Boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the
      Vandals, the siege of Hippo was protracted above fourteen months:
      the sea was continually open; and when the adjacent country had
      been exhausted by irregular rapine, the besiegers themselves were
      compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise. The
      importance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of
      the West. Placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally;
      and the Italian fleet and army were reenforced by Asper, who
      sailed from Constantinople with a powerful armament. As soon as
      the force of the two empires was united under the command of
      Boniface, he boldly marched against the Vandals; and the loss of
      a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa. He
      embarked with the precipitation of despair; and the people of
      Hippo were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy
      the vacant place of the soldiers, the greatest part of whom were
      either slain or made prisoners by the Vandals. The count, whose
      fatal credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic, might
      enter the palace of Ravenna with some anxiety, which was soon
      removed by the smiles of Placidia. Boniface accepted with
      gratitude the rank of patrician, and the dignity of
      master-general of the Roman armies; but he must have blushed at
      the sight of those medals, in which he was represented with the
      name and attributes of victory. 32 The discovery of his fraud,
      the displeasure of the empress, and the distinguished favor of
      his rival, exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Ætius.
      He hastily returned from Gaul to Italy, with a retinue, or rather
      with an army, of Barbarian followers; and such was the weakness
      of the government, that the two generals decided their private
      quarrel in a bloody battle. Boniface was successful; but he
      received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his
      adversary, of which he expired within a few days, in such
      Christian and charitable sentiments, that he exhorted his wife, a
      rich heiress of Spain, to accept Ætius for her second husband.
      But Ætius could not derive any immediate advantage from the
      generosity of his dying enemy: he was proclaimed a rebel by the
      justice of Placidia; and though he attempted to defend some
      strong fortresses, erected on his patrimonial estate, the
      Imperial power soon compelled him to retire into Pannonia, to the
      tents of his faithful Huns. The republic was deprived, by their
      mutual discord, of the service of her two most illustrious
      champions. 33

      Italy. His death is mentioned by Prosper and Marcellinus; the
      expression of the latter, that Ætius, the day before, had
      provided himself with a longer spear, implies something like a
      regular duel.]

      It might naturally be expected, after the retreat of Boniface,
      that the Vandals would achieve, without resistance or delay, the
      conquest of Africa. Eight years, however, elapsed, from the
      evacuation of Hippo to the reduction of Carthage. In the midst of
      that interval, the ambitious Genseric, in the full tide of
      apparent prosperity, negotiated a treaty of peace, by which he
      gave his son Hunneric for a hostage; and consented to leave the
      Western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three
      Mauritanias. 34 This moderation, which cannot be imputed to the
      justice, must be ascribed to the policy, of the conqueror.

      His throne was encompassed with domestic enemies, who accused the
      baseness of his birth, and asserted the legitimate claims of his
      nephews, the sons of Gonderic. Those nephews, indeed, he
      sacrificed to his safety; and their mother, the widow of the
      deceased king, was precipitated, by his order, into the river
      Ampsaga. But the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and
      frequent conspiracies; and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have
      shed more Vandal blood by the hand of the executioner, than in
      the field of battle. 35 The convulsions of Africa, which had
      favored his attack, opposed the firm establishment of his power;
      and the various seditions of the Moors and Germans, the Donatists
      and Catholics, continually disturbed, or threatened, the
      unsettled reign of the conqueror. As he advanced towards
      Carthage, he was forced to withdraw his troops from the Western
      provinces; the sea-coast was exposed to the naval enterprises of
      the Romans of Spain and Italy; and, in the heart of Numidia, the
      strong inland city of Corta still persisted in obstinate
      independence. 36 These difficulties were gradually subdued by the
      spirit, the perseverance, and the cruelty of Genseric; who
      alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the
      establishment of his African kingdom. He subscribed a solemn
      treaty, with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of
      its continuance, and the moment of its violation. The vigilance
      of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship,
      which concealed his hostile approach; and Carthage was at length
      surprised by the Vandals, five hundred and eighty-five years
      after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger
      Scipio. 37

      A new city had arisen from its ruins, with the title of a colony;
      and though Carthage might yield to the royal prerogatives of
      Constantinople, and perhaps to the trade of Alexandria, or the
      splendor of Antioch, she still maintained the second rank in the
      West; as the Rome (if we may use the style of contemporaries) of
      the African world. That wealthy and opulent metropolis 38
      displayed, in a dependent condition, the image of a flourishing
      republic. Carthage contained the manufactures, the arms, and the
      treasures of the six provinces. A regular subordination of civil
      honors gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and
      quarters of the city, to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate,
      who, with the title of proconsul, represented the state and
      dignity of a consul of ancient Rome. Schools and gymnasia were
      instituted for the education of the African youth; and the
      liberal arts and manners, grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, were
      publicly taught in the Greek and Latin languages. The buildings
      of Carthage were uniform and magnificent; a shady grove was
      planted in the midst of the capital; the new port, a secure and
      capacious harbor, was subservient to the commercial industry of
      citizens and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus and
      theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the Barbarians.
      The reputation of the Carthaginians was not equal to that of
      their country, and the reproach of Punic faith still adhered to
      their subtle and faithless character. 39 The habits of trade, and
      the abuse of luxury, had corrupted their manners; but their
      impious contempt of monks, and the shameless practice of
      unnatural lusts, are the two abominations which excite the pious
      vehemence of Salvian, the preacher of the age. 40 The king of the
      Vandals severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people; and
      the ancient, noble, ingenuous freedom of Carthage (these
      expressions of Victor are not without energy) was reduced by
      Genseric into a state of ignominious servitude. After he had
      permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and
      avarice, he instituted a more regular system of rapine and
      oppression. An edict was promulgated, which enjoined all persons,
      without fraud or delay, to deliver their gold, silver, jewels,
      and valuable furniture or apparel, to the royal officers; and the
      attempt to secrete any part of their patrimony was inexorably
      punished with death and torture, as an act of treason against the
      state. The lands of the proconsular province, which formed the
      immediate district of Carthage, were accurately measured, and
      divided among the Barbarians; and the conqueror reserved for his
      peculiar domain the fertile territory of Byzacium, and the
      adjacent parts of Numidia and Getulia. 41

      It was natural enough that Genseric should hate those whom he had
      injured: the nobility and senators of Carthage were exposed to
      his jealousy and resentment; and all those who refused the
      ignominious terms, which their honor and religion forbade them to
      accept, were compelled by the Arian tyrant to embrace the
      condition of perpetual banishment. Rome, Italy, and the provinces
      of the East, were filled with a crowd of exiles, of fugitives,
      and of ingenuous captives, who solicited the public compassion;
      and the benevolent epistles of Theodoret still preserve the
      names and misfortunes of Cælestian and Maria. 42 The Syrian
      bishop deplores the misfortunes of Cælestian, who, from the
      state of a noble and opulent senator of Carthage, was reduced,
      with his wife and family, and servants, to beg his bread in a
      foreign country; but he applauds the resignation of the Christian
      exile, and the philosophic temper, which, under the pressure of
      such calamities, could enjoy more real happiness than was the
      ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity. The story of Maria, the
      daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon, is singular and
      interesting. In the sack of Carthage, she was purchased from the
      Vandals by some merchants of Syria, who afterwards sold her as a
      slave in their native country. A female attendant, transported in
      the same ship, and sold in the same family, still continued to
      respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level
      of servitude; and the daughter of Eudaemon received from her
      grateful affection the domestic services which she had once
      required from her obedience. This remarkable behavior divulged
      the real condition of Maria, who, in the absence of the bishop of
      Cyrrhus, was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some
      soldiers of the garrison. The liberality of Theodoret provided
      for her decent maintenance; and she passed ten months among the
      deaconesses of the church; till she was unexpectedly informed,
      that her father, who had escaped from the ruin of Carthage,
      exercised an honorable office in one of the Western provinces.
      Her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop:
      Theodoret, in a letter still extant, recommends Maria to the
      bishop of Aegae, a maritime city of Cilicia, which was
      frequented, during the annual fair, by the vessels of the West;
      most earnestly requesting, that his colleague would use the
      maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth; and that he would
      intrust her to the care of such faithful merchants, as would
      esteem it a sufficient gain, if they restored a daughter, lost
      beyond all human hope, to the arms of her afflicted parent.

      Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history, I am tempted
      to distinguish the memorable fable of the Seven Sleepers; 43
      whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger
      Theodosius, and the conquest of Africa by the Vandals. 44 When
      the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians, seven noble youths
      of Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side
      of an adjacent mountain; where they were doomed to perish by the
      tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly
      secured by the a pile of huge stones. They immediately fell into
      a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged without injuring
      the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and
      eighty-seven years. At the end of that time, the slaves of
      Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended,
      removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice:
      the light of the sun darted into the cavern, and the Seven
      Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a slumber, as they
      thought of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger;
      and resolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should
      secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his
      companions. The youth (if we may still employ that appellation)
      could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native
      country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a
      large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of
      Ephesus. His singular dress, and obsolete language, confounded
      the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the
      current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a
      secret treasure, was dragged before the judge. Their mutual
      inquiries produced the amazing discovery, that two centuries were
      almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from
      the rage of a Pagan tyrant. The bishop of Ephesus, the clergy,
      the magistrates, the people, and, as it is said, the emperor
      Theodosius himself, hastened to visit the cavern of the Seven
      Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story,
      and at the same instant peaceably expired. The origin of this
      marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and
      credulity of the modern Greeks, since the authentic tradition may
      be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle. James of
      Sarug, a Syrian bishop, who was born only two years after the
      death of the younger Theodosius, has devoted one of his two
      hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of
      Ephesus. 45 Their legend, before the end of the sixth century,
      was translated from the Syriac into the Latin language, by the
      care of Gregory of Tours. The hostile communions of the East
      preserve their memory with equal reverence; and their names are
      honorably inscribed in the Roman, the Abyssinian, and the Russian
      calendar. 46 Nor has their reputation been confined to the
      Christian world. This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn
      when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced as
      a divine revelation, into the Koran. 47 The story of the Seven
      Sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations, from Bengal
      to Africa, who profess the Mahometan religion; 48 and some
      vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the
      remote extremities of Scandinavia. 49 This easy and universal
      belief, so expressive of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to
      the genuine merit of the fable itself. We imperceptibly advance
      from youth to age, without observing the gradual, but incessant,
      change of human affairs; and even in our larger experience of
      history, the imagination is accustomed, by a perpetual series of
      causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions. But if
      the interval between two memorable eras could be instantly
      annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of
      two hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a
      spectator, who still retained a lively and recent impression of
      the old, his surprise and his reflections would furnish the
      pleasing subject of a philosophical romance. The scene could not
      be more advantageously placed, than in the two centuries which
      elapsed between the reigns of Decius and of Theodosius the
      Younger. During this period, the seat of government had been
      transported from Rome to a new city on the banks of the Thracian
      Bosphorus; and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed
      by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude. The
      throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of
      Christian and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous
      gods of antiquity: and the public devotion of the age was
      impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the Catholic church,
      on the altars of Diana and Hercules. The union of the Roman
      empire was dissolved; its genius was humbled in the dust; and
      armies of unknown Barbarians, issuing from the frozen regions of
      the North, had established their victorious reign over the
      fairest provinces of Europe and Africa.

      which Photius had read, assign the date of the thirty-eighth year
      of the reign of Theodosius, which may coincide either with A.D.
      439, or 446. The period which had elapsed since the persecution

      Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part I.

     The Character, Conquests, And Court Of Attila, King Of The
     Huns.—Death Of Theodosius The Younger.—Elevation Of Marcian To The
     Empire Of The East.

      The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who
      fled before the Huns; but the achievements of the Huns themselves
      were not adequate to their power and prosperity. Their victorious
      hordes had spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public
      force was exhausted by the discord of independent chieftains;
      their valor was idly consumed in obscure and predatory
      excursions; and they often degraded their national dignity, by
      condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist under the
      banners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of Attila, 1 the
      Huns again became the terror of the world; and I shall now
      describe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian;
      who alternately insulted and invaded the East and the West, and
      urged the rapid downfall of the Roman empire.

      may be found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34-50, p.
      668-688, edit. Grot.) and Priscus (Excerpta de Legationibus, p.
      33-76, Paris, 1648.) I have not seen the Lives of Attila,
      composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus, in the twelfth
      century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop of Gran, in the
      sixteenth. See Mascou’s History of the Germans, ix., and Maffei
      Osservazioni Litterarie, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern
      Hungarians have added must be fabulous; and they do not seem to
      have excelled in the art of fiction. They suppose, that when
      Attila invaded Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &c., he
      was one hundred and twenty years of age. Thewrocz Chron. c. i. p.
      22, in Script. Hunger. tom. i. p. 76.]

      In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the
      confines of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and
      populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman
      provinces. The accumulated weight was sustained for a while by
      artificial barriers; and the easy condescension of the emperors
      invited, without satisfying, the insolent demands of the
      Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries
      of civilized life. The Hungarians, who ambitiously insert the
      name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth
      that the hordes, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or
      Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern
      Hungary, 2 in a fertile country, which liberally supplied the
      wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds. In this advantageous
      situation, Rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually
      added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of
      peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans
      of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great
      Ætius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp,
      a hospitable reception and a powerful support. At his
      solicitation, and in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand
      Huns advanced to the confines of Italy; their march and their
      retreat were alike expensive to the state; and the grateful
      policy of Ætius abandoned the possession of Pannonia to his
      faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were not less
      apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the
      provinces, or even the capital. Some ecclesiastical historians
      have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence; 3
      but Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of
      stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds
      of gold, and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title
      of general, which the king of the Huns condescended to accept.
      The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce
      impatience of the Barbarians, and the perfidious intrigues of the
      Byzantine court. Four dependent nations, among whom we may
      distinguish the Barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty of the
      Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman
      alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of Rugilas,
      were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador.
      Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was
      ratified by the emperor; and two ambassadors were named,
      Plinthas, a general of Scythian extraction, but of consular rank;
      and the quaestor Epigenes, a wise and experienced statesman, who
      was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague.

      Scythian colonies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. The Abares, in the
      sixth century; and, 3. The Turks or Magiars, A.D. 889; the
      immediate and genuine ancestors of the modern Hungarians, whose
      connection with the two former is extremely faint and remote. The
      Prodromus and Notitia of Matthew Belius appear to contain a rich
      fund of information concerning ancient and modern Hungary. I have

      * Note: Mailath (in his Geschichte der Magyaren) considers the
      question of the origin of the Magyars as still undecided. The old
      Hungarian chronicles unanimously derived them from the Huns of
      Attila See note, vol. iv. pp. 341, 342. The later opinion,
      adopted by Schlozer, Belnay, and Dankowsky, ascribes them, from
      their language, to the Finnish race. Fessler, in his history of
      Hungary, agrees with Gibbon in supposing them Turks. Mailath has
      inserted an ingenious dissertation of Fejer, which attempts to
      connect them with the Parthians. Vol. i. Ammerkungen p. 50—M.]

      authors, strenuously contends (Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136,
      607) that the wars and personages were not the same.]

      The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. His
      two nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of
      their uncle, consented to a personal interview with the
      ambassadors of Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to
      dismount, the business was transacted on horseback, in a spacious
      plain near the city of Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of
      the Huns assumed the solid benefits, as well as the vain honors,
      of the negotiation. They dictated the conditions of peace, and
      each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire.
      Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks
      of the Danube, they required that the annual contribution should
      be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds
      of gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be
      paid for every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian
      master; that the emperor should renounce all treaties and
      engagements with the enemies of the Huns; and that all the
      fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of
      Theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of their offended
      sovereign. This justice was rigorously inflicted on some
      unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the
      territories of the empire, by the command of Attila: and as soon
      as the king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror
      of his name, he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite,
      whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of
      Scythia and Germany. 4

      Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
      descent 5 from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with
      the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation
      of a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and
      the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern
      Calmuk; 6 a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated
      eyes, a flat nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad
      shoulders, and a short square body, of nervous strength, though
      of a disproportioned form. The haughty step and demeanor of the
      king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority
      above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely
      rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he
      inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity; his
      suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or
      pardon; and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and
      indulgent master. He delighted in war; but, after he had ascended
      the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand,
      achieved the conquest of the North; and the fame of an
      adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent
      and successful general. The effects of personal valor are so
      inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even
      among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which
      the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the
      service of a single man. The Scythian conquerors, Attila and
      Zingis, surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in
      courage; and it may be observed that the monarchies, both of the
      Huns and of the Moguls, were erected by their founders on the
      basis of popular superstition. The miraculous conception, which
      fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother of Zingis,
      raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked
      prophet, who in the name of the Deity invested him with the
      empire of the earth, pointed the valor of the Moguls with
      irresistible enthusiasm. 7 The religious arts of Attila were not
      less skillfully adapted to the character of his age and country.
      It was natural enough that the Scythians should adore, with
      peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as they were incapable of
      forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal representation,
      they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron
      cimeter. 8 One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a
      heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and
      curiously followed the track of the blood, till he discovered,
      among the long grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug
      out of the ground and presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or
      rather that artful, prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this
      celestial favor; and, as the rightful possessor of the sword of
      Mars, asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion
      of the earth. 9 If the rites of Scythia were practised on this
      solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of fagots, three
      hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised in a spacious
      plain; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the summit of
      this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the blood of
      sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. 10 Whether human
      sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether
      he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he
      continually offered in the field of battle, the favorite of Mars
      soon acquired a sacred character, which rendered his conquests more
      easy and more permanent; and the Barbarian princes confessed, in
      the language of devotion or flattery, that they could not presume
      to gaze, with a steady eye, on the divine majesty of the king of
      the Huns. 11 His brother Bleda, who reigned over a considerable
      part of the nation, was compelled to resign his sceptre and his
      life. Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural
      impulse; and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword of
      Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his
      invincible arm. 12 But the extent of his empire affords the only
      remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories;
      and the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of
      science and philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate
      subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the
      memory of his exploits.

      If a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the
      savage climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities,
      who cultivated the earth, and the hunters and shepherds, who
      dwelt in tents, Attila might aspire to the title of supreme and
      sole monarch of the Barbarians. 13 He alone, among the conquerors
      of ancient and modern times, united the two mighty kingdoms of
      Germany and Scythia; and those vague appellations, when they are
      applied to his reign, may be understood with an ample latitude.
      Thuringia, which stretched beyond its actual limits as far as the
      Danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed, with
      the weight of a powerful neighbor, in the domestic affairs of the
      Franks; and one of his lieutenants chastised, and almost
      exterminated, the Burgundians of the Rhine.

      He subdued the islands of the ocean, the kingdoms of Scandinavia,
      encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic; and the Huns
      might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region, which
      has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of
      the climate, and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it
      is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the
      Scythian deserts; yet we may be assured, that he reigned on the
      banks of the Volga; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not
      only as a warrior, but as a magician; 14 that he insulted and
      vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen; and that he sent
      ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire of
      China. In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the
      sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his
      lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths
      were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the
      personal merits of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of
      the Gepidae, was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the
      monarch, who esteemed his intrepid genius, whilst he loved the
      mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir, king of the
      Ostrogoths. The crowd of vulgar kings, the leaders of so many
      martial tribes, who served under the standard of Attila, were
      ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the
      person of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at
      his frown; and at the first signal of his will, they executed,
      without murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. In
      time of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops,
      attended the royal camp in regular succession; but when Attila
      collected his military force, he was able to bring into the field
      an army of five, or, according to another account, of seven
      hundred thousand Barbarians. 15

      The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken the attention of
      Theodosius, by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in
      Europe and Asia; since they touched the Danube on one hand, and
      reached, with the other, as far as the Tanais. In the reign of
      his father Arcadius, a band of adventurous Huns had ravaged the
      provinces of the East; from whence they brought away rich spoils
      and innumerable captives. 16 They advanced, by a secret path,
      along the shores of the Caspian Sea; traversed the snowy
      mountains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the
      Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of
      Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and
      disturbed the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch.
      Egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of
      the Holy Land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy
      embarkation. The memory of this invasion was still recent in the
      minds of the Orientals. The subjects of Attila might execute,
      with superior forces, the design which these adventurers had so
      boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of anxious
      conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of
      Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the
      Huns, who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had
      been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the
      emperor, or rather with the general of the West. They related,
      during their residence at Rome, the circumstances of an
      expedition, which they had lately made into the East. After
      passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the Romans to be the
      Lake Maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,
      at the end of fifteen days’ march, on the confines of Media;
      where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and
      Cursic. 1611 They encountered the Persian army in the plains of
      Media and the air, according to their own expression, was
      darkened by a cloud of arrows. But the Huns were obliged to
      retire before the numbers of the enemy. Their laborious retreat
      was effected by a different road; they lost the greatest part of
      their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with some
      knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge. In
      the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors, who discussed,
      at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their
      formidable enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their
      hope, that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long
      and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan. The
      more sagacious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the
      folly and danger of such a hope; and convinced them, that the
      Medes and Persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the
      Huns; and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the
      pride, as well as power, of the conqueror. Instead of contenting
      himself with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which
      equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius, Attila would
      proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks
      of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be
      encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns. 17

      recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of Sicily were
      already filled with the military and naval forces of Theodosius.
      But the subtle Genseric, who spread his negotiations round the
      world, prevented their designs, by exciting the king of the Huns
      to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling incident soon became
      the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. 18 Under the faith
      of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the Northern
      side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress
      surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the
      commercial security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting
      traders; and levelled the fortress with the ground. The Huns
      justified this outrage as an act of reprisal; alleged, that the
      bishop of Margus had entered their territories, to discover and
      steal a secret treasure of their kings; and sternly demanded the
      guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and the fugitive
      subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The refusal
      of the Byzantine court was the signal of war; and the Maesians at
      first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But
      they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and
      the adjacent towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the
      convenient maxim, that a private citizen, however innocent or
      respectable, may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his
      country. The bishop of Margus, who did not possess the spirit of
      a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected. He
      boldly treated with the princes of the Huns: secured, by solemn
      oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous detachment of
      Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube; and, at
      the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his
      episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by
      treachery, served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive
      victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles
      and fortresses; and though the greatest part of them consisted
      only of a single tower, with a small garrison, they were commonly
      sufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy,
      who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a
      regular siege. But these slight obstacles were instantly swept
      away by the inundation of the Huns. 19 They destroyed, with fire
      and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum, of
      Ratiaria and Marcianopolis, of Naissus and Sardica; where every
      circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the
      construction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the
      sole purpose of defence. The whole breadth of Europe, as it
      extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the
      Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated, by
      the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field. The
      public danger and distress could not, however, provoke Theodosius
      to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to appear in person
      at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been
      sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the
      garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military
      force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and
      numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command,
      and the soldiers the duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern
      empire were vanquished in three successive engagements; and the
      progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle.

      The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of
      Marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the
      Danube and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a
      victorious enemy, they gradually, and unskilfully, retired
      towards the Chersonesus of Thrace; and that narrow peninsula, the
      last extremity of the land, was marked by their third, and
      irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of this army, Attila
      acquired the indisputable possession of the field. From the
      Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he
      ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of
      Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps,
      escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the
      most expressive of total extirpation and erasure, are applied to
      the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the
      Eastern empire. 20 Theodosius, his court, and the unwarlike
      people, were protected by the walls of Constantinople; but those
      walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of
      fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach. The
      damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was
      aggravated by a superstitious fear, that Heaven itself had
      delivered the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia, who were
      strangers to the laws, the language, and the religion, of the
      Romans. 21

      effect.]

      In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South, the
      Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and
      destructive spirit. The laws of war, that restrain the exercise
      of national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of
      substantial interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits
      which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest; and a just
      apprehension, lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy’s
      country may be retaliated on our own. But these considerations of
      hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of
      nations. The Huns of Attila may, without injustice, be compared
      to the Moguls and Tartars, before their primitive manners were
      changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of Oriental
      history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals
      of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of
      China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory and
      passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the
      inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might
      be converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese
      mandarin, 22 who insinuated some principles of rational policy
      into the mind of Zingis, diverted him from the execution of this
      horrid design. But in the cities of Asia, which yielded to the
      Moguls, the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with
      a regular form of discipline, which may, with equal reason,
      though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious
      Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their discretion,
      were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble in some
      plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the
      vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the
      soldiers of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing
      arms; and their fate was instantly decided: they were either
      enlisted among the Moguls, or they were massacred on the spot by
      the troops, who, with pointed spears and bended bows, had formed
      a circle round the captive multitude. The second class, composed
      of the young and beautiful women, of the artificers of every rank
      and profession, and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens,
      from whom a private ransom might be expected, was distributed in
      equal or proportionable lots. The remainder, whose life or death
      was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return to
      the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its
      valuable furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched
      inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air.
      Such was the behavior of the Moguls, when they were not conscious
      of any extraordinary rigor. 23 But the most casual provocation,
      the slightest motive of caprice or convenience, often provoked
      them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre; and
      the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such
      unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their own
      expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground
      where they had once stood. The three great capitals of Khorasan,
      Maru, Neisabour, and Herat, were destroyed by the armies of
      Zingis; and the exact account which was taken of the slain
      amounted to four millions three hundred and forty-seven thousand
      persons. 24 Timur, or Tamerlane, was educated in a less barbarous
      age, and in the profession of the Mahometan religion; yet, if
      Attila equalled the hostile ravages of Tamerlane, 25 either the
      Tartar or the Hun might deserve the epithet of the Scourge of
      God. 26

      Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part II.

      It may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the Huns
      depopulated the provinces of the empire, by the number of Roman
      subjects whom they led away into captivity. In the hands of a
      wise legislator, such an industrious colony might have
      contributed to diffuse through the deserts of Scythia the
      rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts; but these captives,
      who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among the
      hordes that obeyed the empire of Attila. The estimate of their
      respective value was formed by the simple judgment of
      unenlightened and unprejudiced Barbarians. Perhaps they might not
      understand the merit of a theologian, profoundly skilled in the
      controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation; yet they
      respected the ministers of every religion; and the active zeal of
      the Christian missionaries, without approaching the person or the
      palace of the monarch, successfully labored in the propagation of
      the gospel. 27 The pastoral tribes, who were ignorant of the
      distinction of landed property, must have disregarded the use, as
      well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of an
      eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their
      abhorrence. 28 The perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the
      Goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national
      dialects; and the Barbarians were ambitious of conversing in
      Latin, the military idiom even of the Eastern empire. 29 But they
      disdained the language and the sciences of the Greeks; and the
      vain sophist, or grave philosopher, who had enjoyed the
      flattering applause of the schools, was mortified to find that
      his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance
      than himself. The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed, as
      they tended to satisfy the wants of the Huns. An architect in the
      service of Onegesius, one of the favorites of Attila, was
      employed to construct a bath; but this work was a rare example of
      private luxury; and the trades of the smith, the carpenter, the
      armorer, were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with
      the useful instruments of peace and war. But the merit of the
      physician was received with universal favor and respect: the
      Barbarians, who despised death, might be apprehensive of disease;
      and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive,
      to whom he ascribed, perhaps, an imaginary power of prolonging or
      preserving his life. 30 The Huns might be provoked to insult the
      misery of their slaves, over whom they exercised a despotic
      command; 31 but their manners were not susceptible of a refined
      system of oppression; and the efforts of courage and diligence
      were often recompensed by the gift of freedom. The historian
      Priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious instruction, was
      accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger, who saluted him in
      the Greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed the
      appearance of a wealthy Scythian. In the siege of Viminiacum, he
      had lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty;
      he became the slave of Onegesius; but his faithful services,
      against the Romans and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to
      the rank of the native Huns; to whom he was attached by the
      domestic pledges of a new wife and several children. The spoils
      of war had restored and improved his private property; he was
      admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apostate Greek
      blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been the
      introduction to a happy and independent state; which he held by
      the honorable tenure of military service. This reflection
      naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the
      Roman government, which was severely arraigned by the apostate,
      and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation. The
      freedman of Onegesius exposed, in true and lively colors, the
      vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the
      victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to
      protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to
      trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable
      weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate
      or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and
      contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial
      proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the
      universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich,
      and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor. A sentiment of
      patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of the
      fortunate exile; and he lamented, with a flood of tears, the
      guilt or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the
      wisest and most salutary institutions. 32

      The timid or selfish policy of the Western Romans had abandoned
      the Eastern empire to the Huns. 33 The loss of armies, and the
      want of discipline or virtue, were not supplied by the personal
      character of the monarch. Theodosius might still affect the
      style, as well as the title, of Invincible Augustus; but he was
      reduced to solicit the clemency of Attila, who imperiously
      dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace. I. The
      emperor of the East resigned, by an express or tacit convention,
      an extensive and important territory, which stretched along the
      southern banks of the Danube, from Singidunum, or Belgrade, as
      far as Novae, in the diocese of Thrace. The breadth was defined
      by the vague computation of fifteen 3311 days’ journey; but, from
      the proposal of Attila to remove the situation of the national
      market, it soon appeared, that he comprehended the ruined city of
      Naissus within the limits of his dominions. II. The king of the
      Huns required and obtained, that his tribute or subsidy should be
      augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of
      two thousand one hundred; and he stipulated the immediate payment
      of six thousand pounds of gold, to defray the expenses, or to
      expiate the guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that such a
      demand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth,
      would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the
      East; and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the
      impoverished, or at least of the disorderly, state of the
      finances. A large proportion of the taxes extorted from the
      people was detained and intercepted in their passage, though the
      foulest channels, to the treasury of Constantinople. The revenue
      was dissipated by Theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and
      profuse luxury; which was disguised by the names of Imperial
      magnificence, or Christian charity. The immediate supplies had
      been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military
      preparations. A personal contribution, rigorously, but
      capriciously, imposed on the members of the senatorian order, was
      the only expedient that could disarm, without loss of time, the
      impatient avarice of Attila; and the poverty of the nobles
      compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to
      public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary
      ornaments of their palaces. 34 III. The king of the Huns appears
      to have established, as a principle of national jurisprudence,
      that he could never lose the property, which he had once
      acquired, in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to his authority. From this principle he
      concluded, and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws,
      that the Huns, who had been taken prisoner in war, should be
      released without delay, and without ransom; that every Roman
      captive, who had presumed to escape, should purchase his right to
      freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the
      Barbarians, who had deserted the standard of Attila, should be
      restored, without any promise or stipulation of pardon.

      In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the
      Imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble
      deserters, who refused to devote themselves to certain death; and
      the Romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of
      any Scythian people, by this public confession, that they were
      destitute either of faith, or power, to protect the suppliant,
      who had embraced the throne of Theodosius. 35

      youth, the skill and reputation of the leaders whom they had
      chosen, and their daring exploits against the innumerable host of
      the Barbarians. Instead of tamely expecting their approach, the
      Azimuntines attacked, in frequent and successful sallies, the
      troops of the Huns, who gradually declined the dangerous
      neighborhood, rescued from their hands the spoil and the
      captives, and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary
      association of fugitives and deserters. After the conclusion of
      the treaty, Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war,
      unless the Azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply
      with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted. The
      ministers of Theodosius confessed with shame, and with truth,
      that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of
      men, who so bravely asserted their natural independence; and the
      king of the Huns condescended to negotiate an equal exchange with
      the citizens of Azimus. They demanded the restitution of some
      shepherds, who, with their cattle, had been accidentally
      surprised. A strict, though fruitless, inquiry was allowed: but
      the Huns were obliged to swear, that they did not detain any
      prisoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two
      surviving countrymen, whom the Azimuntines had reserved as
      pledges for the safety of their lost companions. Attila, on his
      side, was satisfied, and deceived, by their solemn asseveration,
      that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword; and that
      it was their constant practice, immediately to dismiss the Romans
      and the deserters, who had obtained the security of the public
      faith. This prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned,
      or excused, by the casuists, as they incline to the rigid decree
      of St. Augustin, or to the milder sentiment of St. Jerom and St.
      Chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman, must acknowledge,
      that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and
      multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the
      majesty of the empire. 37

      ii. p. 5-20,) which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and
      Protestant divines, and even by lawyers and philosophers of every
      age.]

      It would have been strange, indeed, if Theodosius had purchased,
      by the loss of honor, a secure and solid tranquillity, or if his
      tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries. The
      Byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies;
      38 and the ministers of Attila were uniformly instructed to press
      the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty; to produce
      the names of fugitives and deserters, who were still protected by
      the empire; and to declare, with seeming moderation, that, unless
      their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction, it
      would be impossible for him, were it even his wish, to check the
      resentment of his warlike tribes. Besides the motives of pride
      and interest, which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue
      this train of negotiation, he was influenced by the less
      honorable view of enriching his favorites at the expense of his
      enemies. The Imperial treasury was exhausted, to procure the
      friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal
      attendants, whose favorable report might conduce to the
      maintenance of peace. The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the
      liberal reception of his ministers; he computed, with pleasure,
      the value and splendor of their gifts, rigorously exacted the
      performance of every promise which would contribute to their
      private emolument, and treated as an important business of state
      the marriage of his secretary Constantius. 39 That Gallic
      adventurer, who was recommended by Ætius to the king of the
      Huns, had engaged his service to the ministers of Constantinople,
      for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife; and the
      daughter of Count Saturninus was chosen to discharge the
      obligations of her country. The reluctance of the victim, some
      domestic troubles, and the unjust confiscation of her fortune,
      cooled the ardor of her interested lover; but he still demanded,
      in the name of Attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after many
      ambiguous delays and excuses, the Byzantine court was compelled
      to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of Armatius,
      whose birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most
      illustrious rank of the Roman matrons. For these importunate and
      oppressive embassies, Attila claimed a suitable return: he
      weighed, with suspicious pride, the character and station of the
      Imperial envoys; but he condescended to promise that he would
      advance as far as Sardica to receive any ministers who had been
      invested with the consular dignity. The council of Theodosius
      eluded this proposal, by representing the desolate and ruined
      condition of Sardica, and even ventured to insinuate that every
      officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the
      most powerful princes of Scythia. Maximin, 40 a respectable
      courtier, whose abilities had been long exercised in civil and
      military employments, accepted, with reluctance, the troublesome,
      and perhaps dangerous, commission of reconciling the angry spirit
      of the king of the Huns. His friend, the historian Priscus, 41
      embraced the opportunity of observing the Barbarian hero in the
      peaceful and domestic scenes of life: but the secret of the
      embassy, a fatal and guilty secret, was intrusted only to the
      interpreter Vigilius. The two last ambassadors of the Huns,
      Orestes, a noble subject of the Pannonian province, and Edecon, a
      valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, returned at the
      same time from Constantinople to the royal camp. Their obscure
      names were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune
      and the contrast of their sons: the two servants of Attila became
      the fathers of the last Roman emperor of the West, and of the
      first Barbarian king of Italy.

      The ambassadors, who were followed by a numerous train of men and
      horses, made their first halt at Sardica, at the distance of
      three hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days’ journey, from
      Constantinople. As the remains of Sardica were still included
      within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans
      to exercise the duties of hospitality. They provided, with the
      assistance of the provincials, a sufficient number of sheep and
      oxen, and invited the Huns to a splendid, or at least, a
      plentiful supper. But the harmony of the entertainment was soon
      disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. The greatness of
      the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their
      ministers; the Huns, with equal ardor, asserted the superiority
      of their victorious monarch: the dispute was inflamed by the rash
      and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius, who passionately rejected
      the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius; and
      it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus were able
      to divert the conversation, or to soothe the angry minds, of the
      Barbarians. When they rose from table, the Imperial ambassador
      presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and
      Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Orestes could
      not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with
      such respect and liberality: and the offensive distinction which
      was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of
      his colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and
      Orestes an irreconcilable enemy. After this entertainment, they
      travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus. That
      flourishing city, which has given birth to the great Constantine,
      was levelled with the ground: the inhabitants were destroyed or
      dispersed; and the appearance of some sick persons, who were
      still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches, served
      only to increase the horror of the prospect. The surface of the
      country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the
      ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were
      obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia, before they descended
      into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the
      Danube. The Huns were masters of the great river: their
      navigation was performed in large canoes, hollowed out of the
      trunk of a single tree; the ministers of Theodosius were safely
      landed on the opposite bank; and their Barbarian associates
      immediately hastened to the camp of Attila, which was equally
      prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war. No sooner had
      Maximin advanced about two miles 4111 from the Danube, than he
      began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror. He
      was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest
      he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal
      mansion. 4112 The ministers of Attila pressed them to communicate
      the business, and the instructions, which he reserved for the ear
      of their sovereign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary
      practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find that
      the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory, those secrets (says
      Priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods themselves, had
      been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. On his refusal
      to comply with such ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was
      commanded instantly to depart; the order was recalled; it was
      again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts
      to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin. At length, by the
      intercession of Scotta, the brother of Onegesius, whose
      friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted
      to the royal presence; but, instead of obtaining a decisive
      answer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards
      the north, that Attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of
      receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the Eastern and
      Western empires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who
      obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the
      common road, as it best suited the convenience of the king. The
      Romans, who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they
      passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable
      boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of
      the Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places
      under different names. From the contiguous villages they received
      a plentiful and regular supply of provisions; mead instead of
      wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named
      camus, which according to the report of Priscus, was distilled
      from barley. 42 Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to
      men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople; but, in their
      accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and
      hospitality of the same Barbarians, so terrible and so merciless
      in war. The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large
      morass. A violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and
      lightning, overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and
      furniture in the water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered
      in the darkness of the night, uncertain of their road, and
      apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened by their
      cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village, the property of
      the widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments,
      a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious
      benevolence; the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans were
      liberally satisfied; and they seem to have been embarrassed by
      the singular politeness of Bleda’s widow, who added to her other
      favors the gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of
      beautiful and obsequious damsels. The sunshine of the succeeding
      day was dedicated to repose, to collect and dry the baggage, and
      to the refreshment of the men and horses: but, in the evening,
      before they pursued their journey, the ambassadors expressed
      their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village, by a very
      acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and
      Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march
      of Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and
      slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not
      contain, in the space of several thousand miles, a single city.

      42 (return) [ The Huns themselves still continued to despise the
      labors of agriculture: they abused the privilege of a victorious
      nation; and the Goths, their industrious subjects, who cultivated
      the earth, dreaded their neighborhood, like that of so many
      ravenous wolves, (Priscus, p. 45.) In the same manner the Sarts
      and Tadgics provide for their own subsistence, and for that of
      the Usbec Tartars, their lazy and rapacious sovereigns. See
      Genealogical History of the Tartars, p. 423 455, &c.]

      As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of
      Priscus, this capital appears to have been seated between the
      Danube, the Teyss, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of
      Upper Hungary, and most probably in the neighborhood of Jezberin,
      Agria, or Tokay. 43 In its origin it could be no more than an
      accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent residence of
      Attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge village, for the
      reception of his court, of the troops who followed his person,
      and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and
      retainers. 44 The baths, constructed by Onegesius, were the only
      edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from
      Pannonia; and since the adjacent country was destitute even of
      large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitations of
      the royal village consisted of straw, or mud, or of canvass. The
      wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns were built and adorned
      with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or
      the taste of the proprietors. They seem to have been distributed
      with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more
      honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign. The
      palace of Attila, which surpassed all other houses in his
      dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space
      of ground. The outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or palisade,
      of smooth square timber, intersected with high towers, but
      intended rather for ornament than defence. This wall, which seems
      to have encircled the declivity of a hill, comprehended a great
      variety of wooden edifices, adapted to the uses of royalty.

      A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of
      Attila; and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement
      imposed by Asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the Roman
      ambassadors to their presence, their table, and even to the
      freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his presents
      to Cerca, 4411 the principal queen, he admired the singular
      architecture on her mansion, the height of the round columns, the
      size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously shaped or turned
      or polished or carved; and his attentive eye was able to discover
      some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the
      proportions. After passing through the guards, who watched before
      the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private
      apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit
      sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was covered
      with a carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the queen; and
      her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working the
      variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric
      warriors. The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches
      which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the
      trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes,
      were studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were
      profusely spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold and
      silver, which had been fashioned by the labor of Grecian artists.

      The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to
      the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors. 45 The dress of Attila,
      his arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without
      ornament, and of a single color. The royal table was served in
      wooden cups and platters; flesh was his only food; and the
      conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread.

      43 (return) [ It is evident that Priscus passed the Danube and
      the Teyss, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian
      hills. Agria, Tokay, and Jazberin, are situated in the plains
      circumscribed by this definition. M. de Buat (Histoire des
      Peuples, &c., tom. vii. p. 461) has chosen Tokay; Otrokosci, (p.
      180, apud Mascou, ix. 23,) a learned Hungarian, has preferred
      Jazberin, a place about thirty-six miles westward of Buda and the
      Danube. * Note: M. St. Martin considers the narrative of Priscus,
      the only authority of M. de Buat and of Gibbon, too vague to fix
      the position of Attila’s camp. “It is worthy of remark, that in
      the Hungarian traditions collected by Thwrocz, l. 2, c. 17,
      precisely on the left branch of the Danube, where Attila’s
      residence was situated, in the same parallel stands the present
      city of Buda, in Hungarian Buduvur. It is for this reason that
      this city has retained for a long time among the Germans of
      Hungary the name of Etzelnburgh or Etzela-burgh, i. e., the city
      of Attila. The distance of Buda from the place where Priscus
      crossed the Danube, on his way from Naissus, is equal to that
      which he traversed to reach the residence of the king of the
      Huns. I see no good reason for not acceding to the relations of
      the Hungarian historians.” St. Martin, vi. 191.—M]

      Denys, in the 13th century. (See Rubruquis, in the Histoire
      Generale des Voyages, tom. vii p. 286.) The camp of Aurengzebe,

      de Gengiscan, v. c. 9.]

      When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the
      banks of the Danube, his tent was encompassed with a formidable
      guard. The monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair. His
      stern countenance, angry gestures, and impatient tone, astonished
      the firmness of Maximin; but Vigilius had more reason to tremble,
      since he distinctly understood the menace, that if Attila did not
      respect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful
      interpreter to the cross. and leave his body to the vultures. The
      Barbarian condescended, by producing an accurate list, to expose
      the bold falsehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more
      than seventeen deserters could be found. But he arrogantly
      declared, that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending
      with his fugitive slaves; since he despised their impotent
      efforts to defend the provinces which Theodosius had intrusted to
      their arms: “For what fortress,” (added Attila,) “what city, in
      the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exist, secure
      and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erased
      from the earth?” He dismissed, however, the interpreter, who
      returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more
      complete restitution, and a more splendid embassy.

      His anger gradually subsided, and his domestic satisfaction in a
      marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of
      Eslam, 4511 might perhaps contribute to mollify the native
      fierceness of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal
      village was marked by a very singular ceremony. A numerous troop
      of women came out to meet their hero and their king. They marched
      before him, distributed into long and regular files; the
      intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin
      linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands,
      and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who
      chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language. The wife of his
      favorite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted
      Attila at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace;
      and offered, according to the custom of the country, her
      respectful homage, by entreating him to taste the wine and meat
      which she had prepared for his reception. As soon as the monarch
      had graciously accepted her hospitable gift, his domestics lifted
      a small silver table to a convenient height, as he sat on
      horseback; and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with his
      lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his
      march. During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were
      not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of
      the Huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing
      his person from the public view. He frequently assembled his
      council, and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations; and
      his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal, which he held at
      stated times, and, according to the Eastern custom, before the
      principal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the East
      and of the West, were twice invited to the banquets, where Attila
      feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin and his
      colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had made a
      devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the
      Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their
      respective seats in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch,
      covered with carpets and fine linen, was raised by several steps
      in the midst of the hall; and a son, an uncle, or perhaps a
      favorite king, were admitted to share the simple and homely
      repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of which
      contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either
      hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the Romans
      ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that
      Beric, an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race,
      preceded the representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian. The
      Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled
      with wine, and courteously drank to the health of the most
      distinguished guest; who rose from his seat, and expressed, in
      the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows. This ceremony was
      successively performed for all, or at least for the illustrious
      persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have been
      consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service
      was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the
      meat had been removed; and the Huns continued to indulge their
      intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the
      two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet.
      Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a singular opportunity of
      observing the manners of the nation in their convivial
      amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila, and
      recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his
      valor and his victories. 4512 A profound silence prevailed in the
      hall; and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal
      harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own
      exploits; a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors,
      who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men
      expressed their generous despair, that they could no longer
      partake the danger and glory of the field. 46 This entertainment,
      which might be considered as a school of military virtue, was
      succeeded by a farce, that debased the dignity of human nature. A
      Moorish and a Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of
      the rude spectators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dress,
      antic gestures, absurd speeches, and the strange, unintelligible
      confusion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages; and
      the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In
      the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a
      change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible
      gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of
      Irnac, the youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile
      of paternal tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and
      betrayed a partial affection, which was justified by the
      assurance of his prophets, that Irnac would be the future support
      of his family and empire. Two days afterwards, the ambassadors
      received a second invitation; and they had reason to praise the
      politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila. The king of
      the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin; but
      his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty
      reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to
      support, with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his
      secretary Constantius.

      “The emperor” (said Attila) “has long promised him a rich wife:
      Constantius must not be disappointed; nor should a Roman emperor
      deserve the name of liar.” On the third day, the ambassadors were
      dismissed; the freedom of several captives was granted, for a
      moderate ransom, to their pressing entreaties; and, besides the
      royal presents, they were permitted to accept from each of the
      Scythian nobles the honorable and useful gift of a horse. Maximin
      returned, by the same road, to Constantinople; and though he was
      involved in an accidental dispute with Beric, the new ambassador
      of Attila, he flattered himself that he had contributed, by the
      laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance of the two
      nations.

      have introduced an article to determine the sense. Nor is it

      polygamy, or a marriage, which would be considered incestuous in
      other countries. The Latin version has carefully preserved the
      ambiguity, filiam Escam uxorem. I am not inclined to construe it

      4512 (return) [ This passage is remarkable from the connection of
      the name of Attila with that extraordinary cycle of poetry, which
      is found in different forms in almost all the Teutonic
      languages.]

      A Latin poem, de prima expeditione Attilæ, Regis Hunnorum, in
      Gallias, was published in the year 1780, by Fischer at Leipsic.
      It contains, with the continuation, 1452 lines. It abounds in
      metrical faults, but is occasionally not without some rude spirit
      and some copiousness of fancy in the variation of the
      circumstances in the different combats of the hero Walther,
      prince of Aquitania. It contains little which can be supposed
      historical, and still less which is characteristic concerning
      Attila. It relates to a first expedition of Attila into Europe
      which cannot be traced in history, during which the kings of the
      Franks, of the Burgundians, and of Aquitaine, submit themselves,
      and give hostages to Attila: the king of the Franks, a personage
      who seems the same with the Hagen of Teutonic romance; the king
      of Burgundy, his daughter Heldgund; the king of Aquitaine, his
      son Walther. The main subject of the poem is the escape of
      Walther and Heldgund from the camp of Attila, and the combat
      between Walther and Gunthar, king of the Franks. with his twelve
      peers, among whom is Hagen. Walther had been betrayed while he
      passed through Worms, the city of the Frankish king, by paying
      for his ferry over the Rhine with some strange fish, which he had
      caught during his flight, and which were unknown in the waters of
      the Rhine. Gunthar was desirous of plundering him of the
      treasure, which Walther had carried off from the camp of Attila.
      The author of this poem is unknown, nor can I, on the vague and
      rather doubtful allusion to Thule, as Iceland, venture to assign
      its date. It was, evidently, recited in a monastery, as appears
      by the first line; and no doubt composed there. The faults of
      metre would point out a late date; and it may have been formed
      upon some local tradition, as Walther, the hero, seems to have
      turned monk.

      This poem, however, in its character and its incidents, bears no
      relation to the Teutonic cycle, of which the Nibelungen Lied is
      the most complete form. In this, in the Heldenbuch, in some of
      the Danish Sagas. in countess lays and ballads in all the
      dialects of Scandinavia, appears King Etzel (Attila) in strife
      with the Burgundians and the Franks. With these appears, by a
      poetic anachronism, Dietrich of Berne. (Theodoric of Verona,) the
      celebrated Ostrogothic king; and many other very singular
      coincidences of historic names, which appear in the poems. (See
      Lachman Kritik der Sage in his volume of various readings to the
      Nibelungen; Berlin, 1836, p. 336.)




      Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part III.

      I must acknowledge myself unable to form any satisfactory theory
      as to the connection of these poems with the history of the time,
      or the period, from which they may date their origin;
      notwithstanding the laborious investigations and critical
      sagacity of the Schlegels, the Grimms, of P. E. Muller and
      Lachman, and a whole host of German critics and antiquaries; not
      to omit our own countryman, Mr. Herbert, whose theory concerning
      Attila is certainly neither deficient in boldness nor
      originality. I conceive the only way to obtain any thing like a
      clear conception on this point would be what Lachman has begun,
      (see above,) patiently to collect and compare the various forms
      which the traditions have assumed, without any preconceived,
      either mythical or poetical, theory, and, if possible, to
      discover the original basis of the whole rich and fantastic
      legend. One point, which to me is strongly in favor of the
      antiquity of this poetic cycle, is, that the manners are so
      clearly anterior to chivalry, and to the influence exercised on
      the poetic literature of Europe by the chivalrous poems and
      romances. I think I find some traces of that influence in the
      Latin poem, though strained through the imagination of a monk.
      The English reader will find an amusing account of the German
      Nibelungen and Heldenbuch, and of some of the Scandinavian Sagas,
      in the volume of Northern Antiquities published by Weber, the
      friend of Sir Walter Scott. Scott himself contributed a
      considerable, no doubt far the most valuable, part to the work.

      required few observations, and was not susceptible of any
      collateral evidence, may be found in Priscus, p. 49-70. But I
      have not confined myself to the same order; and I had previously
      extracted the historical circumstances, which were less
      intimately connected with the journey, and business, of the Roman
      ambassadors.]

      But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the treacherous design,
      which had been concealed under the mask of the public faith. The
      surprise and satisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the
      splendor of Constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter
      Vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch
      Chrysaphius, 48 who governed the emperor and the empire. After
      some previous conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the
      eunuch, who had not, from his own feelings or experience, imbibed
      any exalted notions of ministerial virtue, ventured to propose
      the death of Attila, as an important service, by which Edecon
      might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he
      admired. The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting
      offer; and professed, with apparent zeal, his ability, as well as
      readiness, to execute the bloody deed; the design was
      communicated to the master of the offices, and the devout
      Theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible
      enemy. But this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the
      dissimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and though he might
      exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which he seemed
      to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and
      voluntary confession. If we now review the embassy of Maximin,
      and the behavior of Attila, we must applaud the Barbarian, who
      respected the laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and
      dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his
      life. But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more
      extraordinary, since he returned, conscious of his guilt and
      danger, to the royal camp, accompanied by his son, and carrying
      with him a weighty purse of gold, which the favorite eunuch had
      furnished, to satisfy the demands of Edecon, and to corrupt the
      fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was instantly seized, and
      dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where he asserted his
      innocence with specious firmness, till the threat of inflicting
      instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of
      the criminal transaction. Under the name of ransom, or
      confiscation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred
      pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to
      punish. He pointed his just indignation against a nobler object.
      His ambassadors, Eslaw and Orestes, were immediately despatched
      to Constantinople, with a peremptory instruction, which it was
      much safer for them to execute than to disobey. They boldly
      entered the Imperial presence, with the fatal purse hanging down
      from the neck of Orestes; who interrogated the eunuch
      Chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognized
      the evidence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reserved
      for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw, who gravely
      addressed the emperor of the East in the following words:
      “Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent:
      Attila likewise is descended from a noble race; and he has
      supported, by his actions, the dignity which he inherited from
      his father Mundzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his paternal
      honors, and, by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to
      the condition of a slave. It is therefore just, that he should
      reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him;
      instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to
      conspire against his master.” The son of Arcadius, who was
      accustomed only to the voice of flattery, heard with astonishment
      the severe language of truth: he blushed and trembled; nor did he
      presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius, which Eslaw
      and Orestes were instructed to demand. A solemn embassy, armed
      with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent to
      deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the
      choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two ministers of consular or
      patrician rank, of whom the one was great treasurer, and the
      other was master-general of the armies of the East. He
      condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the River
      Drenco; and though he at first affected a stern and haughty
      demeanor, his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence
      and liberality. He condescended to pardon the emperor, the
      eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himself by an oath to observe
      the conditions of peace; released a great number of captives;
      abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate; and resigned
      a large territory, to the south of the Danube, which he had
      already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants. But this treaty
      was purchased at an expense which might have supported a vigorous
      and successful war; and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled
      to redeem the safety of a worthless favorite by oppressive taxes,
      which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction.

      fixed by any precise date; but the series of negotiations between
      Attila and the Eastern empire must be included within the three
      or four years which are terminated, A.D. 450. by the death of
      Theodosius.]

      The emperor Theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating
      circumstance of an inglorious life. As he was riding, or hunting,
      in the neighborhood of Constantinople, he was thrown from his
      horse into the River Lycus: the spine of the back was injured by
      the fall; and he expired some days afterwards, in the fiftieth
      year of his age, and the forty-third of his reign. 50 His sister
      Pulcheria, whose authority had been controlled both in civil and
      ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the
      eunuchs, was unanimously proclaimed Empress of the East; and the
      Romans, for the first time, submitted to a female reign. No
      sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged her
      own and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice.
      Without any legal trial, the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed
      before the gates of the city; and the immense riches which had
      been accumulated by the rapacious favorite, served only to hasten
      and to justify his punishment. 51 Amidst the general acclamations
      of the clergy and people, the empress did not forget the
      prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed; and she
      wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a
      colleague, who would always respect the superior rank and virgin
      chastity of his wife. She gave her hand to Marcian, a senator,
      about sixty years of age; and the nominal husband of Pulcheria
      was solemnly invested with the Imperial purple. The zeal which he
      displayed for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the
      council of Chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful
      eloquence of the Catholics. But the behavior of Marcian in a
      private life, and afterwards on the throne, may support a more
      rational belief, that he was qualified to restore and invigorate
      an empire, which had been almost dissolved by the successive
      weakness of two hereditary monarchs. He was born in Thrace, and
      educated to the profession of arms; but Marcian’s youth had been
      severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only
      resource, when he first arrived at Constantinople, consisted in
      two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. He
      passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of
      Aspar, and his son Ardaburius; followed those powerful generals
      to the Persian and African wars; and obtained, by their
      influence, the honorable rank of tribune and senator. His mild
      disposition, and useful talents, without alarming the jealousy,
      recommended Marcian to the esteem and favor of his patrons; he
      had seen, perhaps he had felt, the abuses of a venal and
      oppressive administration; and his own example gave weight and
      energy to the laws, which he promulgated for the reformation of
      manners. 52

     Attila, Ætius, And Valentinian The Third.

      It was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided, as
      long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace;
      but it was likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be honorable
      or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to
      war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of
      Attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute.
      The emperor signified to the Barbarians, that they must no longer
      insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute; that he
      was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful
      friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate
      the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and
      arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks. The same language,
      even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador
      Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he
      had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of
      dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared
      to expect from the degenerate Romans. 1 He threatened to chastise
      the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated whether he
      should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or
      the Western empire. While mankind awaited his decision with awful
      suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and
      Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with
      the same haughty declaration. “Attila, my lord, and thy lord,
      commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception.” 2
      But as the Barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the Romans
      of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared
      his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had
      achieved a more glorious and important enterprise. In the
      memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally
      attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the
      particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be
      explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of
      Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the
      administration of Ætius. 3

      After the death of his rival Boniface, Ætius had prudently
      retired to the tents of the Huns; and he was indebted to their
      alliance for his safety and his restoration. Instead of the
      suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at
      the head of sixty thousand Barbarians; and the empress Placidia
      confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which
      might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness
      or fear. She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the
      Western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could
      Placidia protect the son-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and
      faithful Sebastian, 4 from the implacable persecution which urged
      him from one kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in
      the service of the Vandals. The fortunate Ætius, who was
      immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice
      invested with the honors of the consulship, assumed, with the
      title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military
      power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary
      writers, the duke, or general, of the Romans of the West. His
      prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the
      grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple; and
      Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy,
      while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and
      a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the
      Western empire. The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses, that
      Ætius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic; 5 and
      the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colors,
      must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than
      of flattery. 411 “His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian, and
      his father Gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the
      province of Scythia, gradually rose from the station of a
      military domestic, to the dignity of master of the cavalry. Their
      son, who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards, was
      given as a hostage, first to Alaric, and afterwards to the Huns;
      412 and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of
      the palace, for which he was equally qualified by superior merit.
      The graceful figure of Ætius was not above the middle stature;
      but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,
      and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing
      a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin. He could
      patiently endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and
      body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts. He
      possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers,
      but injuries: and it was impossible either to corrupt, or
      deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul.” 6 The
      Barbarians, who had seated themselves in the Western provinces,
      were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the
      patrician Ætius. He soothed their passions, consulted their
      prejudices, balanced their interests, and checked their ambition.
      611 A seasonable treaty, which he concluded with Genseric,
      protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals; the
      independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid;
      the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and
      Spain; and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi, whom he had
      vanquished in the field, to become the useful confederates of the
      republic.

      From a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, Ætius
      assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns. While he resided
      in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly
      conversed with Attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and
      the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a
      personal and military friendship, which they afterwards confirmed
      by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of
      Carpilio, the son of Ætius, in the camp of Attila. By the
      specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the
      patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian
      conqueror, who pressed the two empires with his innumerable
      armies. His demands were obeyed or eluded. When he claimed the
      spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been
      fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of
      Noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints: 7
      and it is evident, from their conversation with Maximin and
      Priscus, in the royal village, that the valor and prudence of
      Ætius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy
      of tribute. Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of
      a salutary peace; and a numerous army of Huns and Alani, whom he
      had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of Gaul.
      Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the
      territories of Valens and Orleans; 8 and their active cavalry
      secured the important passages of the Rhone and of the Loire.
      These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the
      subjects than to the enemies of Rome. Their original settlement
      was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the
      province through which they marched was exposed to all the
      calamities of a hostile invasion. 9 Strangers to the emperor or
      the republic, the Alani of Gaul were devoted to the ambition of
      Ætius, and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with
      Attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their
      national king, the patrician labored to restrain, rather than to
      excite, their zeal and resentment against the Goths, the
      Burgundians, and the Franks.

      his presence.]

      The kingdom established by the Visigoths in the southern
      provinces of Gaul, had gradually acquired strength and maturity;
      and the conduct of those ambitious Barbarians, either in peace or
      war, engaged the perpetual vigilance of Ætius. After the death
      of Wallia, the Gothic sceptre devolved to Theodoric, the son of
      the great Alaric; 10 and his prosperous reign of more than thirty
      years, over a turbulent people, may be allowed to prove, that his
      prudence was supported by uncommon vigor, both of mind and body.
      Impatient of his narrow limits, Theodoric aspired to the
      possession of Arles, the wealthy seat of government and commerce;
      but the city was saved by the timely approach of Ætius; and the
      Gothic king, who had raised the siege with some loss and
      disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the
      martial valor of his subjects in a Spanish war. Yet Theodoric
      still watched, and eagerly seized, the favorable moment of
      renewing his hostile attempts. The Goths besieged Narbonne, while
      the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians; and the
      public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union
      of the enemies of Rome. On every side, the activity of Ætius,
      and his Scythian cavalry, opposed a firm and successful
      resistance. Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle; and
      the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the
      mountains of Savoy. 11 The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by
      the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last
      extremities of famine, when Count Litorius, approaching in
      silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two
      sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the
      besiegers. The siege was immediately raised; and the more
      decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of
      Ætius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand
      Goths. But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily
      summoned to Italy by some public or private interest, Count
      Litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon
      discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing
      of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war. At
      the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of
      Thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his
      misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made
      desperate. The predictions of the augurs had inspired Litorius
      with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic
      capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan
      allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace,
      which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of
      Theodoric. The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the
      edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation; nor did he
      lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for
      the combat. His soldiers, animated with martial and religious
      enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius. The conflict was
      obstinate; the slaughter was mutual. The Roman general, after a
      total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful
      rashness, was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse, not
      in his own, but in a hostile triumph; and the misery which he
      experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the
      compassion of the Barbarians themselves. 12 Such a loss, in a
      country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted,
      could not easily be repaired; and the Goths, assuming, in their
      turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted
      their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone, if the
      presence of Ætius had not restored strength and discipline to
      the Romans. 13 The two armies expected the signal of a decisive
      action; but the generals, who were conscious of each other’s
      force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed
      their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was
      permanent and sincere. Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, appears
      to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his
      allies, and the esteem of mankind. His throne was surrounded by
      six valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the
      exercises of the Barbarian camp, and in those of the Gallic
      schools: from the study of the Roman jurisprudence, they acquired
      the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious
      sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their
      native manners. 14 The two daughters of the Gothic king were
      given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi
      and of the Vandals, who reigned in Spain and Africa: but these
      illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord. The
      queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly
      massacred by her brother. The princess of the Vandals was the
      victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father. The cruel
      Genseric suspected that his son’s wife had conspired to poison
      him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her
      nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was
      ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed
      and mutilated condition. This horrid act, which must seem
      incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator;
      but Theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king,
      to revenge such irreparable injuries. The Imperial ministers, who
      always cherished the discord of the Barbarians, would have
      supplied the Goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the
      African war; and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to
      himself, if the artful Vandal had not armed, in his cause, the
      formidable power of the Huns. His rich gifts and pressing
      solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila; and the designs of
      Ætius and Theodoric were prevented by the invasion of Gaul. 15

      The Franks, whose monarchy was still confined to the neighborhood
      of the Lower Rhine, had wisely established the right of
      hereditary succession in the noble family of the Merovingians. 16
      These princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military
      command; 17 and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of
      their birth and dignity. Their flaxen locks, which they combed
      and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on
      their back and shoulders; while the rest of the nation were
      obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of
      their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content
      themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers. 18 The lofty
      stature of the Franks, and their blue eyes, denoted a Germanic
      origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of
      their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt;
      their bodies were protected by a large shield; and these warlike
      Barbarians were trained, from their earliest youth, to run, to
      leap, to swim; to dart the javelin, or battle-axe, with unerring
      aim; to advance, without hesitation, against a superior enemy;
      and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible
      reputation of their ancestors. 19 Clodion, the first of their
      long-haired kings, whose name and actions are mentioned in
      authentic history, held his residence at Dispargum, 20 a village
      or fortress, whose place may be assigned between Louvain and
      Brussels. From the report of his spies, the king of the Franks
      was informed, that the defenceless state of the second Belgic
      must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valor of his
      subjects. He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses
      of the Carbonarian forest; 21 occupied Tournay and Cambray, the
      only cities which existed in the fifth century, and extended his
      conquests as far as the River Somme, over a desolate country,
      whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent
      industry. 22 While Clodion lay encamped in the plains of Artois,
      23 and celebrated, with vain and ostentatious security, the
      marriage, perhaps, of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted
      by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Ætius, who had
      passed the Somme at the head of his light cavalry. The tables,
      which had been spread under the shelter of a hill, along the
      banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the Franks
      were oppressed before they could recover their arms, or their
      ranks; and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves.
      The loaded wagons, which had followed their march, afforded a
      rich booty; and the virgin-bride, with her female attendants,
      submitted to the new lovers, who were imposed on them by the
      chance of war. This advance, which had been obtained by the skill
      and activity of Ætius, might reflect some disgrace on the
      military prudence of Clodion; but the king of the Franks soon
      regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the
      possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme. 24
      Under his reign, and most probably from the enterprising spirit
      of his subjects, his three capitals, Mentz, Treves, and Cologne,
      experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice. The
      distress of Cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of
      the same Barbarians, who evacuated the ruins of Treves; and
      Treves, which in the space of forty years had been four times
      besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her
      afflictions in the vain amusements of the Circus. 25 The death of
      Clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to
      the discord and ambition of his two sons. Meroveus, the younger,
      26 was persuaded to implore the protection of Rome; he was
      received at the Imperial court, as the ally of Valentinian, and
      the adopted son of the patrician Ætius; and dismissed to his
      native country, with splendid gifts, and the strongest assurances
      of friendship and support. During his absence, his elder brother
      had solicited, with equal ardor, the formidable aid of Attila;
      and the king of the Huns embraced an alliance, which facilitated
      the passage of the Rhine, and justified, by a specious and
      honorable pretence, the invasion of Gaul. 27

      Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part II.

      When Attila declared his resolution of supporting the cause of
      his allies, the Vandals and the Franks, at the same time, and
      almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry, the savage monarch
      professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess
      Honoria. The sister of Valentinian was educated in the palace of
      Ravenna; and as her marriage might be productive of some danger
      to the state, she was raised, by the title of Augusta, 28 above
      the hopes of the most presumptuous subject. But the fair Honoria
      had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age, than she
      detested the importunate greatness which must forever exclude her
      from the comforts of honorable love; in the midst of vain and
      unsatisfactory pomp, Honoria sighed, yielded to the impulse of
      nature, and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain
      Eugenius. Her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of
      imperious man) were soon betrayed by the appearances of
      pregnancy; but the disgrace of the royal family was published to
      the world by the imprudence of the empress Placidia who dismissed
      her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a
      remote exile at Constantinople. The unhappy princess passed
      twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of
      Theodosius, and their chosen virgins; to whose crown Honoria
      could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer,
      fasting, and vigils, she reluctantly imitated. Her impatience of
      long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and
      desperate resolution. The name of Attila was familiar and
      formidable at Constantinople; and his frequent embassies
      entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the
      Imperial palace. In the pursuit of love, or rather of revenge,
      the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty and every
      prejudice; and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a
      Barbarian, of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was
      scarcely human, and whose religion and manners she abhorred. By
      the ministry of a faithful eunuch, she transmitted to Attila a
      ring, the pledge of her affection; and earnestly conjured him to
      claim her as a lawful spouse, to whom he had been secretly
      betrothed. These indecent advances were received, however, with
      coldness and disdain; and the king of the Huns continued to
      multiply the number of his wives, till his love was awakened by
      the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice. The invasion
      of Gaul was preceded, and justified, by a formal demand of the
      princess Honoria, with a just and equal share of the Imperial
      patrimony. His predecessors, the ancient Tanjous, had often
      addressed, in the same hostile and peremptory manner, the
      daughters of China; and the pretensions of Attila were not less
      offensive to the majesty of Rome. A firm, but temperate, refusal
      was communicated to his ambassadors. The right of female
      succession, though it might derive a specious argument from the
      recent examples of Placidia and Pulcheria, was strenuously
      denied; and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed
      to the claims of her Scythian lover. 29 On the discovery of her
      connection with the king of the Huns, the guilty princess had
      been sent away, as an object of horror, from Constantinople to
      Italy: her life was spared; but the ceremony of her marriage was
      performed with some obscure and nominal husband, before she was
      immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and
      misfortunes, which Honoria might have escaped, had she not been
      born the daughter of an emperor. 30

      they cannot be made consistent, or probable, unless we separate,
      by an interval of time and place, her intrigue with Eugenius, and
      her invitation of Attila.]

      A native of Gaul, and a contemporary, the learned and eloquent
      Sidonius, who was afterwards bishop of Clermont, had made a
      promise to one of his friends, that he would compose a regular
      history of the war of Attila. If the modesty of Sidonius had not
      discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work, 31
      the historian would have related, with the simplicity of truth,
      those memorable events, to which the poet, in vague and doubtful
      metaphors, has concisely alluded. 32 The kings and nations of
      Germany and Scythia, from the Volga perhaps to the Danube, obeyed
      the warlike summons of Attila. From the royal village, in the
      plains of Hungary his standard moved towards the West; and after
      a march of seven or eight hundred miles, he reached the conflux
      of the Rhine and the Neckar, where he was joined by the Franks,
      who adhered to his ally, the elder of the sons of Clodion. A
      troop of light Barbarians, who roamed in quest of plunder, might
      choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the
      ice; but the innumerable cavalry of the Huns required such plenty
      of forage and provisions, as could be procured only in a milder
      season; the Hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of
      boats; and the hostile myriads were poured, with resistless
      violence, into the Belgic provinces. 33 The consternation of Gaul
      was universal; and the various fortunes of its cities have been
      adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles. 34 Troyes was
      saved by the merits of St. Lupus; St. Servatius was removed from
      the world, that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres; and the
      prayers of St. Genevieve diverted the march of Attila from the
      neighborhood of Paris. But as the greatest part of the Gallic
      cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers, they were
      besieged and stormed by the Huns; who practised, in the example
      of Metz, 35 their customary maxims of war. They involved, in a
      promiscuous massacre, the priests who served at the altar, and
      the infants, who, in the hour of danger, had been providently
      baptized by the bishop; the flourishing city was delivered to the
      flames, and a solitary chapel of St. Stephen marked the place
      where it formerly stood. From the Rhine and the Moselle, Attila
      advanced into the heart of Gaul; crossed the Seine at Auxerre;
      and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the
      walls of Orleans. He was desirous of securing his conquests by
      the possession of an advantageous post, which commanded the
      passage of the Loire; and he depended on the secret invitation of
      Sangiban, king of the Alani, who had promised to betray the city,
      and to revolt from the service of the empire. But this
      treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed: Orleans had
      been strengthened with recent fortifications; and the assaults of
      the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the
      soldiers, or citizens, who defended the place. The pastoral
      diligence of Anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and
      consummate prudence, exhausted every art of religious policy to
      support their courage, till the arrival of the expected succors.
      After an obstinate siege, the walls were shaken by the battering
      rams; the Huns had already occupied the suburbs; and the people,
      who were incapable of bearing arms, lay prostrate in prayer.
      Anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours, despatched a
      trusty messenger to observe, from the rampart, the face of the
      distant country. He returned twice, without any intelligence that
      could inspire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he
      mentioned a small cloud, which he had faintly descried at the
      extremity of the horizon. “It is the aid of God!” exclaimed the
      bishop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude
      repeated after him, “It is the aid of God.” The remote object, on
      which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger, and more
      distinct; the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived;
      and a favorable wind blowing aside the dust, discovered, in deep
      array, the impatient squadrons of Ætius and Theodoric, who
      pressed forwards to the relief of Orleans.

      actual residence of his sovereigns, the kings of Austrasia? The
      learned count, who seems to have undertaken the apology of Attila
      and the Barbarians, appeals to the false Idatius, parcens
      Germaniae et Galliae, and forgets that the true Idatius had
      explicitly affirmed, plurimae civitates effractoe, among which he
      enumerates Metz.]

      The facility with which Attila had penetrated into the heart of
      Gaul, may be ascribed to his insidious policy, as well as to the
      terror of his arms. His public declarations were skilfully
      mitigated by his private assurances; he alternately soothed and
      threatened the Romans and the Goths; and the courts of Ravenna
      and Thoulouse, mutually suspicious of each other’s intentions,
      beheld, with supine indifference, the approach of their common
      enemy. Ætius was the sole guardian of the public safety; but his
      wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction, which, since the
      death of Placidia, infested the Imperial palace: the youth of
      Italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet; and the Barbarians,
      who, from fear or affection, were inclined to the cause of
      Attila, awaited with doubtful and venal faith, the event of the
      war. The patrician passed the Alps at the head of some troops,
      whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army.
      36 But on his arrival at Arles, or Lyons, he was confounded by
      the intelligence, that the Visigoths, refusing to embrace the
      defence of Gaul, had determined to expect, within their own
      territories, the formidable invader, whom they professed to
      despise. The senator Avitus, who, after the honorable exercise of
      the Prætorian præfecture, had retired to his estate in
      Auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he
      executed with ability and success. He represented to Theodoric,
      that an ambitious conqueror, who aspired to the dominion of the
      earth, could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance
      of the powers whom he labored to oppress. The lively eloquence of
      Avitus inflamed the Gothic warriors, by the description of the
      injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns; whose
      implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of
      the Pyrenees. He strenuously urged, that it was the duty of every
      Christian to save, from sacrilegious violation, the churches of
      God, and the relics of the saints: that it was the interest of
      every Barbarian, who had acquired a settlement in Gaul, to defend
      the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use,
      against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds. Theodoric
      yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the measure at once the
      most prudent and the most honorable; and declared, that, as the
      faithful ally of Ætius and the Romans, he was ready to expose
      his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul. 37 The
      Visigoths, who, at that time, were in the mature vigor of their
      fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war; prepared
      their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their
      aged king, who was resolved, with his two eldest sons, Torismond
      and Theodoric, to command in person his numerous and valiant
      people. The example of the Goths determined several tribes or
      nations, that seemed to fluctuate between the Huns and the
      Romans. The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually
      collected the troops of Gaul and Germany, who had formerly
      acknowledged themselves the subjects, or soldiers, of the
      republic, but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service,
      and the rank of independent allies; the Læti, the Armoricans,
      the Breones, the Saxons, the Burgundians, the Sarmatians, or
      Alani, the Ripuarians, and the Franks who followed Meroveus as
      their lawful prince. Such was the various army, which, under the
      conduct of Ætius and Theodoric, advanced, by rapid marches to
      relieve Orleans, and to give battle to the innumerable host of
      Attila. 38

      The Loeti were a promiscuous race of Barbarians, born or
      naturalized in Gaul; and the Riparii, or Ripuarii, derived their
      name from their post on the three rivers, the Rhine, the Meuse,
      and the Moselle; the Armoricans possessed the independent cities
      between the Seine and the Loire. A colony of Saxons had been
      planted in the diocese of Bayeux; the Burgundians were settled in
      Savoy; and the Breones were a warlike tribe of Rhaetians, to the
      east of the Lake of Constance.]

      On their approach the king of the Huns immediately raised the
      siege, and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops
      from the pillage of a city which they had already entered. 39 The
      valor of Attila was always guided by his prudence; and as he
      foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul,
      he repassed the Seine, and expected the enemy in the plains of
      Chalons, whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the
      operations of his Scythian cavalry. But in this tumultuary
      retreat, the vanguard of the Romans and their allies continually
      pressed, and sometimes engaged, the troops whom Attila had posted
      in the rear; the hostile columns, in the darkness of the night
      and the perplexity of the roads, might encounter each other
      without design; and the bloody conflict of the Franks and
      Gepidae, in which fifteen thousand 40 Barbarians were slain, was
      a prelude to a more general and decisive action. The Catalaunian
      fields 41 spread themselves round Chalons, and extend, according
      to the vague measurement of Jornandes, to the length of one
      hundred and fifty, and the breadth of one hundred miles, over the
      whole province, which is entitled to the appellation of a
      champaign country. 42 This spacious plain was distinguished,
      however, by some inequalities of ground; and the importance of a
      height, which commanded the camp of Attila, was understood and
      disputed by the two generals. The young and valiant Torismond
      first occupied the summit; the Goths rushed with irresistible
      weight on the Huns, who labored to ascend from the opposite side:
      and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the
      troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory. The
      anxiety of Attila prompted him to consult his priests and
      haruspices. It was reported, that, after scrutinizing the
      entrails of victims, and scraping their bones, they revealed, in
      mysterious language, his own defeat, with the death of his
      principal adversary; and that the Barbarians, by accepting the
      equivalent, expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior
      merit of Ætius. But the unusual despondency, which seemed to
      prevail among the Huns, engaged Attila to use the expedient, so
      familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by
      a military oration; and his language was that of a king, who had
      often fought and conquered at their head. 43 He pressed them to
      consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future
      hopes. The same fortune, which opened the deserts and morasses of
      Scythia to their unarmed valor, which had laid so many warlike
      nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the joys of this
      memorable field for the consummation of their victories. The
      cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their
      advantageous posts, he artfully represented as the effects, not
      of prudence, but of fear. The Visigoths alone were the strength
      and nerves of the opposite army; and the Huns might securely
      trample on the degenerate Romans, whose close and compact order
      betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally incapable of
      supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle. The
      doctrine of predestination, so favorable to martial virtue, was
      carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who assured his
      subjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were safe and
      invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring
      Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious
      peace. “I myself,” continued Attila, “will throw the first
      javelin, and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his
      sovereign, is devoted to inevitable death.” The spirit of the
      Barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the voice, and the
      example of their intrepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their
      impatience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head
      of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied in person the centre
      of the line. The nations subject to his empire, the Rugians, the
      Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Burgundians, were
      extended on either hand, over the ample space of the Catalaunian
      fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the
      Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the
      Ostrogoths, were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes
      of the Visigoths. The disposition of the allies was regulated by
      a different principle. Sangiban, the faithless king of the Alani,
      was placed in the centre, where his motions might be strictly
      watched, and that the treachery might be instantly punished.
      Ætius assumed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the
      right wing; while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights
      which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the
      rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the
      Atlantic were assembled on the plain of Chalons; but many of
      these nations had been divided by faction, or conquest, or
      emigration; and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns, which
      threatened each other, presented the image of a civil war.

      original Scythian cast; and I doubt, whether an Italian of the
      sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis gaudia.]

      The discipline and tactics of the Greeks and Romans form an
      interesting part of their national manners. The attentive study
      of the military operations of Xenophon, or Caesar, or Frederic,
      when they are described by the same genius which conceived and
      executed them, may tend to improve (if such improvement can be
      wished) the art of destroying the human species. But the battle
      of Chalons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the
      object; since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of
      Barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whose civil
      or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of
      military affairs. Cassiolorus, however, had familiarly conversed
      with many Gothic warriors, who served in that memorable
      engagement; “a conflict,” as they informed him, “fierce, various,
      obstinate, and bloody; such as could not be paralleled either in
      the present or in past ages.” The number of the slain amounted to
      one hundred and sixty-two thousand, or, according to another
      account, three hundred thousand persons; 44 and these incredible
      exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to
      justify the historian’s remark, that whole generations may be
      swept away by the madness of kings, in the space of a single
      hour. After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons,
      in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior
      dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were
      furiously mingled in closer combat. The Huns, who fought under
      the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful
      centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and
      wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole
      force against the Visigoths. As Theodoric rode along the ranks,
      to animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the
      javelin of Andages, a noble Ostrogoth, and immediately fell from
      his horse. The wounded king was oppressed in the general
      disorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and
      this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of
      the haruspices. Attila already exulted in the confidence of
      victory, when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills, and
      verified the remainder of the prediction. The Visigoths, who had
      been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the
      Alani, gradually restored their order of battle; and the Huns
      were undoubtedly vanquished, since Attila was compelled to
      retreat. He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private
      soldier; but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed
      forwards beyond the rest of the line; their attack was faintly
      supported; their flanks were unguarded; and the conquerors of
      Scythia and Germany were saved by the approach of the night from
      a total defeat. They retired within the circle of wagons that
      fortified their camp; and the dismounted squadrons prepared
      themselves for a defence, to which neither their arms, nor their
      temper, were adapted. The event was doubtful: but Attila had
      secured a last and honorable resource. The saddles and rich
      furniture of the cavalry were collected, by his order, into a
      funeral pile; and the magnanimous Barbarian had resolved, if his
      intrenchments should be forced, to rush headlong into the flames,
      and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have
      acquired, by the death or captivity of Attila. 45

      into two great battles; the former near Orleans, the latter in
      Champagne: in the one, Theodoric was slain in the other, he was
      revenged.]

      But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and
      anxiety. The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to
      urge the pursuit, till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few
      followers, in the midst of the Scythian wagons. In the confusion
      of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horse; and the
      Gothic prince must have perished like his father, if his youthful
      strength, and the intrepid zeal of his companions, had not
      rescued him from this dangerous situation. In the same manner,
      but on the left of the line, Ætius himself, separated from his
      allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate,
      encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered
      over the plains of Chalons; and at length reached the camp of the
      Goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of
      shields, till the dawn of day. The Imperial general was soon
      satisfied of the defeat of Attila, who still remained inactive
      within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody
      scene, he observed, with secret satisfaction, that the loss had
      principally fallen on the Barbarians. The body of Theodoric,
      pierced with honorable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the
      slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father;
      but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his
      funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy.
      The Goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest
      son Torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their
      success; and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a
      sacred portion of his paternal inheritance. Yet the Goths
      themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of
      their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared
      Attila to a lion encompassed in his den, and threatening his
      hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations who might have
      deserted his standard in the hour of distress, were made sensible
      that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and
      inevitable danger. All his instruments of martial music
      incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and
      the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or
      destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the
      intrenchments. It was determined, in a general council of war, to
      besiege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his
      provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful
      treaty or an unequal combat. But the impatience of the Barbarians
      soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures; and the
      mature policy of Ætius was apprehensive that, after the
      extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppressed by the
      pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the
      superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions,
      which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty; represented,
      with seeming affection and real truth, the dangers of absence and
      delay and persuaded Torismond to disappoint, by his speedy
      return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy
      the throne and treasures of Thoulouse. 46 After the departure of
      the Goths, and the separation of the allied army, Attila was
      surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of
      Chalons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him
      several days within the circle of his wagons, and his retreat
      beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in
      the name of the Western empire. Meroveus and his Franks,
      observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion of their
      strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night,
      continued to follow the rear of the Huns till they reached the
      confines of Thuringia. The Thuringians served in the army of
      Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return,
      the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war
      that they exercised the cruelties which, about fourscore years
      afterwards, were revenged by the son of Clovis. They massacred
      their hostages, as well as their captives: two hundred young
      maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage; their
      bodies were torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones were
      crushed under the weight of rolling wagons; and their unburied
      limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and
      vultures. Such were those savage ancestors, whose imaginary
      virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized
      ages. 47

      ii. c. 7, p. 163,) dismissed the prince of the Franks, by
      suggesting to him a similar apprehension. The false Idatius
      ridiculously pretends, that Ætius paid a clandestine nocturnal
      visit to the kings of the Huns and of the Visigoths; from each of
      whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold, as the

      diet, in the territory of Eisenach. See Mascou, ix. 30, who

      Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part III.

      Neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the reputation, of
      Attila, were impaired by the failure of the Gallic expedition. In
      the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess
      Honoria, and her patrimonial treasures. The demand was again
      rejected, or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the
      field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with
      an innumerable host of Barbarians. Those Barbarians were
      unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege, which,
      even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least
      some practice, of the mechanic arts. But the labor of many
      thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed
      without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work.
      The skill of the Roman artists might be corrupted to the
      destruction of their country. The walls of Aquileia were
      assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, movable
      turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire; 48 and
      the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope,
      fear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which
      delayed the conquest of Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of
      the richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime
      cities of the Adriatic coast. The Gothic auxiliaries, who
      appeared to have served under their native princes, Alaric and
      Antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens
      still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which
      their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian,
      who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple. Three months were
      consumed without effect in the siege of the Aquileia; till the
      want of provisions, and the clamors of his army, compelled Attila
      to relinquish the enterprise; and reluctantly to issue his
      orders, that the troops should strike their tents the next
      morning, and begin their retreat. But as he rode round the walls,
      pensive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork preparing
      to leave her nest, in one of the towers, and to fly with her
      infant family towards the country. He seized, with the ready
      penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance
      had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and
      cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached
      to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats,
      unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and
      solitude. 49 The favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory;
      the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor; a large
      breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had
      taken her flight; the Huns mounted to the assault with
      irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely
      discover the ruins of Aquileia. 50 After this dreadful
      chastisement, Attila pursued his march; and as he passed, the
      cities of Altinum, Concordia, and Padua, were reduced into heaps
      of stones and ashes. The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and
      Bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns. Milan
      and Pavia submitted, without resistance, to the loss of their
      wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from
      the flames the public, as well as private, buildings, and spared
      the lives of the captive multitude. The popular traditions of
      Comum, Turin, or Modena, may justly be suspected; yet they concur
      with more authentic evidence to prove, that Attila spread his
      ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy; which are
      divided by the Po, and bounded by the Alps and Apennine. 51 When
      he took possession of the royal palace of Milan, he was surprised
      and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the
      Caesars seated on their throne, and the princes of Scythia
      prostrate at their feet. The revenge which Attila inflicted on
      this monument of Roman vanity, was harmless and ingenious. He
      commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes; and
      the emperors were delineated on the same canvas, approaching in a
      suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before
      the throne of the Scythian monarch. 52 The spectators must have
      confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration; and were
      perhaps tempted to apply, on this singular occasion, the
      well-known fable of the dispute between the lion and the man. 53

      It is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila, that the
      grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod. Yet the
      savage destroyer undesignedly laid the foundation of a republic,
      which revived, in the feudal state of Europe, the art and spirit
      of commercial industry. The celebrated name of Venice, or
      Venetia, 54 was formerly diffused over a large and fertile
      province of Italy, from the confines of Pannonia to the River
      Addua, and from the Po to the Rhaetian and Julian Alps. Before
      the irruption of the Barbarians, fifty Venetian cities flourished
      in peace and prosperity: Aquileia was placed in the most
      conspicuous station: but the ancient dignity of Padua was
      supported by agriculture and manufactures; and the property of
      five hundred citizens, who were entitled to the equestrian rank,
      must have amounted, at the strictest computation, to one million
      seven hundred thousand pounds. Many families of Aquileia, Padua,
      and the adjacent towns, who fled from the sword of the Huns,
      found a safe, though obscure, refuge in the neighboring islands.
      55 At the extremity of the Gulf, where the Adriatic feebly
      imitates the tides of the ocean, near a hundred small islands are
      separated by shallow water from the continent, and protected from
      the waves by several long slips of land, which admit the entrance
      of vessels through some secret and narrow channels. 56 Till the
      middle of the fifth century, these remote and sequestered spots
      remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost
      without a name. But the manners of the Venetian fugitives, their
      arts and their government, were gradually formed by their new
      situation; and one of the epistles of Cassiodorus, 57 which
      describes their condition about seventy years afterwards, may be
      considered as the primitive monument of the republic. 571 The
      minister of Theodoric compares them, in his quaint declamatory
      style, to water-fowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom of
      the waves; and though he allows, that the Venetian provinces had
      formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates, that they
      were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble
      poverty. Fish was the common, and almost the universal, food of
      every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt,
      which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that
      commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the
      neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver. A people,
      whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or
      water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the
      demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. The
      islanders, who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected
      with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the
      secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland
      canals. Their vessels, which were continually increasing in size
      and number, visited all the harbors of the Gulf; and the marriage
      which Venice annually celebrates with the Adriatic, was
      contracted in her early infancy. The epistle of Cassiodorus, the
      Prætorian præfect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes; and
      he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal
      of their countrymen for the public service, which required their
      assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the
      province of Istria to the royal city of Ravenna. The ambiguous
      office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition, that,
      in the twelve principal islands, twelve tribunes, or judges, were
      created by an annual and popular election. The existence of the
      Venetian republic under the Gothic kingdom of Italy, is attested
      by the same authentic record, which annihilates their lofty claim
      of original and perpetual independence. 58

      The Italians, who had long since renounced the exercise of arms,
      were surprised, after forty years’ peace, by the approach of a
      formidable Barbarian, whom they abhorred, as the enemy of their
      religion, as well as of their republic. Amidst the general
      consternation, Ætius alone was incapable of fear; but it was
      impossible that he should achieve, alone and unassisted, any
      military exploits worthy of his former renown. The Barbarians who
      had defended Gaul, refused to march to the relief of Italy; and
      the succors promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and
      doubtful. Since Ætius, at the head of his domestic troops, still
      maintained the field, and harassed or retarded the march of
      Attila, he never showed himself more truly great, than at the
      time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful
      people. 59 If the mind of Valentinian had been susceptible of any
      generous sentiments, he would have chosen such a general for his
      example and his guide. But the timid grandson of Theodosius,
      instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound of war;
      and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome, from an impregnable
      fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of
      abandoning Italy, as soon as the danger should approach his
      Imperial person. This shameful abdication was suspended, however,
      by the spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to
      pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious
      tendency. The Western emperor, with the senate and people of
      Rome, embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a
      solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of Attila. This important
      commission was accepted by Avienus, who, from his birth and
      riches, his consular dignity, the numerous train of his clients,
      and his personal abilities, held the first rank in the Roman
      senate. The specious and artful character of Avienus 60 was
      admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or
      private interest: his colleague Trigetius had exercised the
      Prætorian præfecture of Italy; and Leo, bishop of Rome,
      consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock. The
      genius of Leo 61 was exercised and displayed in the public
      misfortunes; and he has deserved the appellation of Great, by the
      successful zeal with which he labored to establish his opinions
      and his authority, under the venerable names of orthodox faith
      and ecclesiastical discipline. The Roman ambassadors were
      introduced to the tent of Attila, as he lay encamped at the place
      where the slow-winding Mincius is lost in the foaming waves of
      the Lake Benacus, 62 and trampled, with his Scythian cavalry, the
      farms of Catullus and Virgil. 63 The Barbarian monarch listened
      with favorable, and even respectful, attention; and the
      deliverance of Italy was purchased by the immense ransom, or
      dowry, of the princess Honoria. The state of his army might
      facilitate the treaty, and hasten his retreat. Their martial
      spirit was relaxed by the wealth and idolence of a warm climate.
      The shepherds of the North, whose ordinary food consisted of milk
      and raw flesh, indulged themselves too freely in the use of
      bread, of wine, and of meat, prepared and seasoned by the arts of
      cookery; and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the
      injuries of the Italians. 64 When Attila declared his resolution
      of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome, he was
      admonished by his friends, as well as by his enemies, that Alaric
      had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city. His mind,
      superior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor
      could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often
      been subservient to his designs. 65 The pressing eloquence of
      Leo, his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes, excited the
      veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians.
      The apparition of the two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, who
      menaced the Barbarian with instant death, if he rejected the
      prayer of their successor, is one of the noblest legends of
      ecclesiastical tradition. The safety of Rome might deserve the
      interposition of celestial beings; and some indulgence is due to
      a fable, which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael, and
      the chisel of Algardi. 66

      Before the king of the Huns evacuated Italy, he threatened to
      return more dreadful, and more implacable, if his bride, the
      princess Honoria, were not delivered to his ambassadors within
      the term stipulated by the treaty. Yet, in the mean while, Attila
      relieved his tender anxiety, by adding a beautiful maid, whose
      name was Ildico, to the list of his innumerable wives. 67 Their
      marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity, at his
      wooden palace beyond the Danube; and the monarch, oppressed with
      wine and sleep, retired at a late hour from the banquet to the
      nuptial bed. His attendants continued to respect his pleasures,
      or his repose, the greatest part of the ensuing day, till the
      unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions; and, after
      attempting to awaken Attila by loud and repeated cries, they at
      length broke into the royal apartment. They found the trembling
      bride sitting by the bedside, hiding her face with her veil, and
      lamenting her own danger, as well as the death of the king, who
      had expired during the night. 68 An artery had suddenly burst:
      and as Attila lay in a supine posture, he was suffocated by a
      torrent of blood, which, instead of finding a passage through the
      nostrils, regurgitated into the lungs and stomach. His body was
      solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain, under a silken
      pavilion; and the chosen squadrons of the Huns, wheeling round in
      measured evolutions, chanted a funeral song to the memory of a
      hero, glorious in his life, invincible in his death, the father
      of his people, the scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the
      world. According to their national custom, the Barbarians cut off
      a part of their hair, gashed their faces with unseemly wounds,
      and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved, not with the
      tears of women, but with the blood of warriors. The remains of
      Attila were enclosed within three coffins, of gold, of silver,
      and of iron, and privately buried in the night: the spoils of
      nations were thrown into his grave; the captives who had opened
      the ground were inhumanly massacred; and the same Huns, who had
      indulged such excessive grief, feasted, with dissolute and
      intemperate mirth, about the recent sepulchre of their king. It
      was reported at Constantinople, that on the fortunate night on
      which he expired, Marcian beheld in a dream the bow of Attila
      broken asunder: and the report may be allowed to prove, how
      seldom the image of that formidable Barbarian was absent from the
      mind of a Roman emperor. 69

      The revolution which subverted the empire of the Huns,
      established the fame of Attila, whose genius alone had sustained
      the huge and disjointed fabric. After his death, the boldest
      chieftains aspired to the rank of kings; the most powerful kings
      refused to acknowledge a superior; and the numerous sons, whom so
      many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch, divided and
      disputed, like a private inheritance, the sovereign command of
      the nations of Germany and Scythia. The bold Ardaric felt and
      represented the disgrace of this servile partition; and his
      subjects, the warlike Gepidae, with the Ostrogoths, under the
      conduct of three valiant brothers, encouraged their allies to
      vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty. In a bloody and
      decisive conflict on the banks of the River Netad, in Pannonia,
      the lance of the Gepidae, the sword of the Goths, the arrows of
      the Huns, the Suevic infantry, the light arms of the Heruli, and
      the heavy weapons of the Alani, encountered or supported each
      other; and the victory of the Ardaric was accompanied with the
      slaughter of thirty thousand of his enemies. Ellac, the eldest
      son of Attila, lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of
      Netad: his early valor had raised him to the throne of the
      Acatzires, a Scythian people, whom he subdued; and his father,
      who loved the superior merit, would have envied the death of
      Ellac. 70 His brother, Dengisich, with an army of Huns, still
      formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above
      fifteen years on the banks of the Danube. The palace of Attila,
      with the old country of Dacia, from the Carpathian hills to the
      Euxine, became the seat of a new power, which was erected by
      Ardaric, king of the Gepidae. The Pannonian conquests from Vienna
      to Sirmium, were occupied by the Ostrogoths; and the settlements
      of the tribes, who had so bravely asserted their native freedom,
      were irregularly distributed, according to the measure of their
      respective strength. Surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of
      his father’s slaves, the kingdom of Dengisich was confined to the
      circle of his wagons; his desperate courage urged him to invade
      the Eastern empire: he fell in battle; and his head ignominiously
      exposed in the Hippodrome, exhibited a grateful spectacle to the
      people of Constantinople. Attila had fondly or superstitiously
      believed, that Irnac, the youngest of his sons, was destined to
      perpetuate the glories of his race. The character of that prince,
      who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich,
      was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns; and
      Irnac, with his subject hordes, retired into the heart of the
      Lesser Scythia. They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new
      Barbarians, who followed the same road which their own ancestors
      had formerly discovered. The Geougen, or Avares, whose residence
      is assigned by the Greek writers to the shores of the ocean,
      impelled the adjacent tribes; till at length the Igours of the
      North, issuing from the cold Siberian regions, which produce the
      most valuable furs, spread themselves over the desert, as far as
      the Borysthenes and the Caspian gates; and finally extinguished
      the empire of the Huns. 71

      Such an event might contribute to the safety of the Eastern
      empire, under the reign of a prince who conciliated the
      friendship, without forfeiting the esteem, of the Barbarians. But
      the emperor of the West, the feeble and dissolute Valentinian,
      who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age
      of reason or courage, abused this apparent security, to undermine
      the foundations of his own throne, by the murder of the patrician
      Ætius. From the instinct of a base and jealous mind, he hated
      the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the
      Barbarians, and the support of the republic; 711 and his new
      favorite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor from the
      supine lethargy, which might be disguised, during the life of
      Placidia, 72 by the excuse of filial piety. The fame of Ætius,
      his wealth and dignity, the numerous and martial train of
      Barbarian followers, his powerful dependants, who filled the
      civil offices of the state, and the hopes of his son Gaudentius,
      who was already contracted to Eudoxia, the emperor’s daughter,
      had raised him above the rank of a subject. The ambitious
      designs, of which he was secretly accused, excited the fears, as
      well as the resentment, of Valentinian. Ætius himself, supported
      by the consciousness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his
      innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet
      behavior. The patrician offended his sovereign by a hostile
      declaration; he aggravated the offence, by compelling him to
      ratify, with a solemn oath, a treaty of reconciliation and
      alliance; he proclaimed his suspicions, he neglected his safety;
      and from a vain confidence that the enemy, whom he despised, was
      incapable even of a manly crime, he rashly ventured his person in
      the palace of Rome. Whilst he urged, perhaps with intemperate
      vehemence, the marriage of his son, Valentinian, drawing his
      sword, the first sword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the
      breast of a general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and
      eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master; and
      Ætius, pierced with a hundred wounds, fell dead in the royal
      presence. Boethius, the Prætorian præfect, was killed at the
      same moment, and before the event could be divulged, the
      principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace,
      and separately murdered. The horrid deed, palliated by the
      specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately
      communicated by the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and
      his allies. The nations, who were strangers or enemies to Ætius,
      generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero: the Barbarians,
      who had been attached to his service, dissembled their grief and
      resentment: and the public contempt, which had been so long
      entertained for Valentinian, was at once converted into deep and
      universal abhorrence. Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of
      a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a
      Roman, whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit. “I am
      ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know, that
      you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his
      left.” 73

      the preserver of the empire, the conqueror of the most dangerous
      of the barbarians: it is by no means clear that he was not

      early acts of his life, the introduction of the Huns into Italy,
      and of the Vandals into Africa, were among the proximate causes
      of the ruin of the empire, his murder was the signal for its

      world, and was not inclined to flatter a minister who had injured
      or disgraced Avitus and Majorian, the successive heroes of his
      song.]

      The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent
      visits of Valentinian; who was consequently more despised at Rome
      than in any other part of his dominions. A republican spirit was
      insensibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and even
      their supplies, became necessary for the support of his feeble
      government. The stately demeanor of an hereditary monarch offended
      their pride; and the pleasures of Valentinian were injurious to
      the peace and honor of noble families. The birth of the empress
      Eudoxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection
      deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband
      dissipated in vague and unlawful amours. Petronius Maximus, a
      wealthy senator of the Anician family, who had been twice consul,
      was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife: her obstinate
      resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian;
      and he resolved to accomplish them, either by stratagem or force.
      Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court: the emperor, who,
      by chance or contrivance, had gained from Maximus a considerable
      sum, uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt;
      and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife, with an order, in
      her husband’s name, that she should immediately attend the
      empress Eudoxia. The unsuspecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in
      her litter to the Imperial palace; the emissaries of her
      impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bed-chamber;
      and Valentinian violated, without remorse, the laws of
      hospitality. Her tears, when she returned home, her deep
      affliction, and her bitter reproaches against a husband whom she
      considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited Maximus to
      a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition;
      and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the Roman
      senate, to the throne of a detested and despicable rival.
      Valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid,
      like his own, of friendship and gratitude, had imprudently
      admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of
      Ætius. Two of these, of Barbarian race were persuaded to execute
      a sacred and honorable duty, by punishing with death the assassin
      of their patron; and their intrepid courage did not long expect a
      favorable moment. Whilst Valentinian amused himself, in the field
      of Mars, with the spectacle of some military sports, they
      suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, despatched the
      guilty Heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without
      the least opposition from his numerous train, who seemed to
      rejoice in the tyrant’s death. Such was the fate of Valentinian
      the Third, 74 the last Roman emperor of the family of Theodosius.
      He faithfully imitated the hereditary weakness of his cousin and
      his two uncles, without inheriting the gentleness, the purity,
      the innocence, which alleviate, in their characters, the want of
      spirit and ability. Valentinian was less excusable, since he had
      passions, without virtues: even his religion was questionable;
      and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy, he
      scandalized the pious Christians by his attachment to the profane
      arts of magic and divination.

      74 (return) [ With regard to the cause and circumstances of the
      deaths of Ætius and Valentinian, our information is dark and
      imperfect. Procopius (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 4, p. 186, 187,
      188) is a fabulous writer for the events which precede his own
      memory. His narrative must therefore be supplied and corrected by
      five or six Chronicles, none of which were composed in Rome or
      Italy; and which can only express, in broken sentences, the
      popular rumors, as they were conveyed to Gaul, Spain, Africa,
      Constantinople, or Alexandria.]

      As early as the time of Cicero and Varro, it was the opinion of
      the Roman augurs, that the twelve vultures which Romulus had
      seen, represented the twelve centuries, assigned for the fatal
      period of his city. 75 This prophecy, disregarded perhaps in the
      season of health and prosperity, inspired the people with gloomy
      apprehensions, when the twelfth century, clouded with disgrace
      and misfortune, was almost elapsed; 76 and even posterity must
      acknowledge with some surprise, that the arbitrary interpretation
      of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously
      verified in the downfall of the Western empire. But its fall was
      announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures: the
      Roman government appeared every day less formidable to its
      enemies, more odious and oppressive to its subjects. 77 The taxes
      were multiplied with the public distress; economy was neglected
      in proportion as it became necessary; and the injustice of the
      rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people,
      whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have
      alleviated their misery. The severe inquisition which confiscated
      their goods, and tortured their persons, compelled the subjects
      of Valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the
      Barbarians, to fly to the woods and mountains, or to embrace the
      vile and abject condition of mercenary servants. They abjured and
      abhorred the name of Roman citizens, which had formerly excited
      the ambition of mankind. The Armorican provinces of Gaul, and the
      greatest part of Spain, were-thrown into a state of disorderly
      independence, by the confederations of the Bagaudae; and the
      Imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws, and
      ineffectual arms, the rebels whom they had made. 78 If all the
      Barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the same hour, their
      total destruction would not have restored the empire of the West:
      and if Rome still survived, she survived the loss of freedom, of
      virtue, and of honor.

     Empire.—Reign Of Odoacer, The First Barbarian King Of Italy.

      The loss or desolation of the provinces, from the Ocean to the
      Alps, impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal
      prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of
      Africa. The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates
      of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies, which
      relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the
      plebeians. The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an
      unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their
      use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them
      by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed
      the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and
      fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety
      days’ journey from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits
      were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert
      and the Mediterranean. The discovery and conquest of the Black
      nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not
      tempt the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast his eyes
      towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his
      bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.

      The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of
      timber: his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation
      and ship-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a
      mode of warfare which would render every maritime country
      accessible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by
      the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of six centuries,
      the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed
      the empire of the Mediterranean. The success of the Vandals, the
      conquest of Sicily, the sack of Palermo, and the frequent
      descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother
      of Valentinian, and the sister of Theodosius. Alliances were
      formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared,
      for the destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage
      to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or
      elude. The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly
      baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent
      concessions; and the interposition of his formidable confederate,
      the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of
      Africa to the care of their domestic safety. The revolutions of
      the palace, which left the Western empire without a defender, and
      without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions, and
      stimulated the avarice, of Genseric. He immediately equipped a
      numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth
      of the Tyber, about three months after the death of Valentinian,
      and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.

      The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus 1 was often
      alleged as a rare example of human felicity. His birth was noble
      and illustrious, since he descended from the Anician family; his
      dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money;
      and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal
      arts and decent manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable
      gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table
      was hospitable and elegant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public,
      he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;
      2 and it is possible that among these clients, he might deserve
      and possess some real friends. His merit was rewarded by the
      favor of the prince and senate: he thrice exercised the office of
      Prætorian præfect of Italy; he was twice invested with the
      consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. These civil
      honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and
      tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or
      reason, were accurately distributed by a water-clock; and this
      avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus
      entertained of his own happiness. The injury which he received
      from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody
      revenge. Yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the
      resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still
      inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had
      consented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have
      hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those
      inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the
      royal house of Theodosius. The imprudent Maximus disregarded
      these salutary considerations; he gratified his resentment and
      ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet;
      and he heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of
      the senate and people. But the day of his inauguration was the
      last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned (such is the lively
      expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a
      sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his
      wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.
      Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his
      anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when
      he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of
      his former life, the emperor exclaimed, “O fortunate Damocles, 3
      thy reign began and ended with the same dinner;” a well-known
      allusion, which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive
      lesson for princes and subjects.

      deceased emperor. This epistle, with some indulgence, may claim
      the praise of an elegant composition; and it throws much light on
      the character of Maximus.]

      Sidonius concludes his letter with the story of Damocles, which
      Cicero (Tusculan. v. 20, 21) had so inimitably told.]

      The reign of Maximus continued about three months. His hours, of
      which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or
      guilt, or terror, and his throne was shaken by the seditions of
      the soldiers, the people, and the confederate Barbarians. The
      marriage of his son Paladius with the eldest daughter of the late
      emperor, might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his
      family; but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia,
      could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. His
      own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably
      removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to
      violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to
      submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she
      suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband. These
      suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of
      Maximus himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his
      reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she was descended
      from a line of emperors. From the East, however, Eudoxia could
      not hope to obtain any effectual assistance; her father and her
      aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother languished at Jerusalem in
      disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the
      hands of a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Carthage;
      secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and
      persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising
      his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor, justice,
      and compassion. 4 Whatever abilities Maximus might have shown in
      a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an
      empire; and though he might easily have been informed of the
      naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of
      Africa, he expected with supine indifference the approach of the
      enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of negotiation,
      or of a timely retreat. When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth
      of the Tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy
      by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude. The only
      hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a
      precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the
      example of their prince. But no sooner did Maximus appear in the
      streets, than he was assaulted by a shower of stones; a Roman, or
      a Burgundian soldier, claimed the honor of the first wound; his
      mangled body was ignominiously cast into the Tyber; the Roman
      people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the
      author of the public calamities; and the domestics of Eudoxia
      signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress. 5

      observes, with great truth, “Non si puo dir quanto sia facile il
      popolo a sognare e spacciar voci false.” But his argument, from
      the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. The figs

      the third day.]

      betrayed by their Burgundian mercenaries.]

      On the third day after the tumult, Genseric boldly advanced from
      the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city. Instead
      of a sally of the Roman youth, there issued from the gates an
      unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his
      clergy. 6 The fearless spirit of Leo, his authority and
      eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a Barbarian
      conqueror; the king of the Vandals promised to spare the
      unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire, and to
      exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were
      neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of
      Leo was glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his
      country. But Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the
      licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors, whose blind passions
      revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen
      days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private
      wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported
      to the vessels of Genseric. Among the spoils, the splendid relics
      of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable
      example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.

      Since the abolition of Paganism, the Capitol had been violated
      and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still
      respected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for
      the rapacious hands of Genseric. 7 The holy instruments of the
      Jewish worship, 8 the gold table, and the gold candlestick with
      seven branches, originally framed according to the particular
      instructions of God himself, and which were placed in the
      sanctuary of his temple, had been ostentatiously displayed to the
      Roman people in the triumph of Titus. They were afterwards
      deposited in the temple of Peace; and at the end of four hundred
      years, the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to
      Carthage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores
      of the Baltic. These ancient monuments might attract the notice
      of curiosity, as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches,
      enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times,
      afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious
      liberality of Pope Leo, who melted six silver vases, the gift of
      Constantine, each of a hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of
      the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years
      that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury
      of Rome were in some measure restored; and it was difficult
      either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who
      possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth
      of the capital. The Imperial ornaments of the palace, the
      magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy
      plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold and
      silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass
      and copper were laboriously removed. Eudoxia herself, who
      advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the
      imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped of her
      jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, the
      only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as
      a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoisted
      sail, and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of
      Carthage. 9 Many thousand Romans of both sexes, chosen for some
      useful or agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board
      the fleet of Genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the
      unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the division of the booty,
      separated the wives from their husbands, and the children from
      their parents. The charity of Deogratias, bishop of Carthage, 10
      was their only consolation and support. He generously sold the
      gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of
      some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants
      and infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired
      by the hardships which they had suffered in their passage from
      Italy to Africa. By his order, two spacious churches were
      converted into hospitals; the sick were distributed into
      convenient beds, and liberally supplied with food and medicines;
      and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and
      night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a
      tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. Compare
      this scene with the field of Cannae; and judge between Hannibal
      and the successor of St. Cyprian. 11

      The deaths of Ætius and Valentinian had relaxed the ties which
      held the Barbarians of Gaul in peace and subordination. The
      sea-coast was infested by the Saxons; the Alemanni and the Franks
      advanced from the Rhine to the Seine; and the ambition of the
      Goths seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests.
      The emperor Maximus relieved himself, by a judicious choice, from
      the weight of these distant cares; he silenced the solicitations
      of his friends, listened to the voice of fame, and promoted a
      stranger to the general command of the forces of Gaul.

      Avitus, 12 the stranger, whose merit was so nobly rewarded,
      descended from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of
      Auvergne. The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with
      the same ardor, the civil and military professions: and the
      indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and
      jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting. Thirty years
      of his life were laudably spent in the public service; he
      alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation; and the
      soldier of Ætius, after executing the most important embassies,
      was raised to the station of Prætorian præfect of Gaul. Either
      the merit of Avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous
      of repose, since he calmly retired to an estate, which he
      possessed in the neighborhood of Clermont. A copious stream,
      issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud
      and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about two
      miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the
      margin of the lake. The baths, the porticos, the summer and
      winter apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury and
      use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of
      woods, pastures, and meadows. 13 In this retreat, where Avitus
      amused his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of
      husbandry, and the society of his friends, 14 he received the
      Imperial diploma, which constituted him master-general of the
      cavalry and infantry of Gaul. He assumed the military command;
      the Barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might
      employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the
      people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. But the fate
      of Gaul depended on the Visigoths; and the Roman general, less
      attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not
      disdain to visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador. He
      was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric, the king of
      the Goths; but while Avitus laid the foundations of a solid
      alliance with that powerful nation, he was astonished by the
      intelligence, that the emperor Maximus was slain, and that Rome
      had been pillaged by the Vandals. A vacant throne, which he might
      ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition; 15 and the
      Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by their
      irresistible suffrage. They loved the person of Avitus; they
      respected his virtues; and they were not insensible of the
      advantage, as well as honor, of giving an emperor to the West.
      The season was now approaching, in which the annual assembly of
      the seven provinces was held at Arles; their deliberations might
      perhaps be influenced by the presence of Theodoric and his
      martial brothers; but their choice would naturally incline to the
      most illustrious of their countrymen. Avitus, after a decent
      resistance, accepted the Imperial diadem from the representatives
      of Gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the
      Barbarians and provincials. The formal consent of Marcian,
      emperor of the East, was solicited and obtained; but the senate,
      Rome, and Italy, though humbled by their recent calamities,
      submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the Gallic
      usurper.

      12 (return) [ The private life and elevation of Avitus must be

      authors, profane and religious; the former for the men, the
      latter for the ladies. The table was twice served, at dinner and
      supper, with hot meat (boiled and roast) and wine. During the
      intermediate time, the company slept, took the air on horseback,

      ii. c. 1l, in tom. ii. p. 168.)]

      Theodoric, to whom Avitus was indebted for the purple, had
      acquired the Gothic sceptre by the murder of his elder brother
      Torismond; and he justified this atrocious deed by the design
      which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with
      the empire. 16 Such a crime might not be incompatible with the
      virtues of a Barbarian; but the manners of Theodoric were gentle
      and humane; and posterity may contemplate without terror the
      original picture of a Gothic king, whom Sidonius had intimately
      observed, in the hours of peace and of social intercourse. In an
      epistle, dated from the court of Thoulouse, the orator satisfies
      the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following
      description: 17 “By the majesty of his appearance, Theodoric
      would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit;
      and although he is born a prince, his merit would dignify a
      private station. He is of a middle stature, his body appears
      rather plump than fat, and in his well-proportioned limbs agility
      is united with muscular strength. 18 If you examine his
      countenance, you will distinguish a high forehead, large shaggy
      eyebrows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white
      teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from
      modesty than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time,
      as far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely
      represented. Before daybreak, he repairs, with a small train, to
      his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by the Arian
      clergy; but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments,
      consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and
      policy. The rest of the morning is employed in the administration
      of his kingdom. His chair is surrounded by some military officers
      of decent aspect and behavior: the noisy crowd of his Barbarian
      guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted
      to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the
      council-chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the nations
      are successively introduced: Theodoric listens with attention,
      answers them with discreet brevity, and either announces or
      delays, according to the nature of their business, his final
      resolution. About eight (the second hour) he rises from his
      throne, and visits either his treasury or his stables. If he
      chooses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on horseback,
      his bow is carried by a favorite youth; but when the game is
      marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the
      object of his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such
      ignoble warfare; but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any
      military service which he could perform himself. On common days,
      his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen,
      but every Saturday, many honorable guests are invited to the
      royal table, which, on these occasions, is served with the
      elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order and
      diligence of Italy. 19 The gold or silver plate is less
      remarkable for its weight than for the brightness and curious
      workmanship: the taste is gratified without the help of foreign
      and costly luxury; the size and number of the cups of wine are
      regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance; and the
      respectful silence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave
      and instructive conversation. After dinner, Theodoric sometimes
      indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes, he
      calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget
      the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express the
      passions which are excited by the incidents of play. At this
      game, which he loves as the image of war, he alternately displays
      his eagerness, his skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper.
      If he loses, he laughs; he is modest and silent if he wins. Yet,
      notwithstanding this seeming indifference, his courtiers choose
      to solicit any favor in the moments of victory; and I myself, in
      my applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my
      losses. 20 About the ninth hour (three o’clock) the tide of
      business again returns, and flows incessantly till after sunset,
      when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of
      suppliants and pleaders. At the supper, a more familiar repast,
      buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced, to divert, not
      to offend, the company, by their ridiculous wit: but female
      singers, and the soft, effeminate modes of music, are severely
      banished, and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of
      valor are alone grateful to the ear of Theodoric. He retires from
      table; and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the
      entrance of the treasury, the palace, and the private
      apartments.”

      When the king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the
      purple, he offered his person and his forces, as a faithful
      soldier of the republic. 21 The exploits of Theodoric soon
      convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike
      virtues of his ancestors. After the establishment of the Goths in
      Aquitain, and the passage of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi,
      who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, aspired to the conquest
      of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the
      Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona,
      afflicted by a hostile invasion, represented their injuries and
      their apprehensions. Count Fronto was despatched, in the name of
      the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and
      alliance; and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to
      declare, that, unless his brother-in-law, the king of the Suevi,
      immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of
      justice and of Rome. “Tell him,” replied the haughty Rechiarius,
      “that I despise his friendship and his arms; but that I shall
      soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the
      walls of Thoulouse.” Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent
      the bold designs of his enemy; he passed the Pyrenees at the head
      of the Visigoths: the Franks and Burgundians served under his
      standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of
      Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors,
      the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies,
      or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of
      the River Urbicus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the
      decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have
      extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of
      battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still
      retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and
      dignity. 22 His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the
      Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more
      especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of
      the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and
      altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate
      king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean;
      but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was
      delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither
      desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the
      death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody
      sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his
      victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of
      Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the
      miraculous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was stopped in the full
      career of success, and recalled from Spain before he could
      provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards
      the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country
      through which he passed; and, in the sack of Pollentia and
      Astorga, he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel
      enemy. Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in
      the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the
      honor and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the
      disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on the throne of the
      Western empire. 23

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part II.

      The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the
      emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the
      consulship for the ensuing year. On the first day of January, his
      son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a
      panegyric of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it
      was rewarded with a brass statue, 24 seems to contain a very
      moderate proportion, either of genius or of truth. The poet, if
      we may degrade that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a
      sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious
      reign was soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a time when
      the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and
      danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age
      had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused
      of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the
      husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated. 25 But the
      Romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to
      acknowledge his virtues. The several parts of the empire became
      every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of
      Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. The senate
      asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;
      and their authority, which had been originally derived from the
      old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a
      declining monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted
      the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been
      supported, or perhaps inflamed, by the Count Ricimer, one of the
      principal commanders of the Barbarian troops, who formed the
      military defence of Italy. The daughter of Wallia, king of the
      Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was descended, on
      the father’s side, from the nation of the Suevi; 26 his pride or
      patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his
      countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose
      elevation he had not been consulted. His faithful and important
      services against the common enemy rendered him still more
      formidable; 27 and, after destroying on the coast of Corsica a
      fleet of Vandals, which consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer
      returned in triumph with the appellation of the Deliverer of
      Italy. He chose that moment to signify to Avitus, that his reign
      was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his
      Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing
      struggle to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however, or the
      contempt, of Ricimer, 28 he was permitted to descend from the
      throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but
      the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their
      inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death. He fled
      towards the Alps, with the humble hope, not of arming the
      Visigoths in his cause, but of securing his person and treasures
      in the sanctuary of Julian, one of the tutelar saints of
      Auvergne. 29 Disease, or the hand of the executioner, arrested
      him on the road; yet his remains were decently transported to
      Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the
      feet of his holy patron. 30 Avitus left only one daughter, the
      wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of his
      father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment of
      his public and private expectations. His resentment prompted him
      to join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious
      faction in Gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it
      was incumbent on him to expiate, by a new tribute of flattery to
      the succeeding emperor. 31

      The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great
      and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate
      age, to vindicate the honor of the human species. The emperor
      Majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of
      posterity; and these praises may be strongly expressed in the
      words of a judicious and disinterested historian: “That he was
      gentle to his subjects; that he was terrible to his enemies; and
      that he excelled, in every virtue, all his predecessors who had
      reigned over the Romans.” 32 Such a testimony may justify at
      least the panegyric of Sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the
      assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have
      flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the
      extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion,
      within the bounds of truth. 33 Majorian derived his name from his
      maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius,
      had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his
      daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian, a respectable
      officer, who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and
      integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of Ætius to
      the tempting offer of an insidious court. His son, the future
      emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed,
      from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and
      unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the
      standard of Ætius, contributed to his success, shared, and
      sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jealousy
      of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire
      from the service. 34 Majorian, after the death of Ætius, was
      recalled and promoted; and his intimate connection with Count
      Ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of
      the Western empire. During the vacancy that succeeded the
      abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth
      excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy with the
      title of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous
      station of master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after
      an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of
      the Romans, whose favor Majorian had solicited by a recent
      victory over the Alemanni. 35 He was invested with the purple at
      Ravenna: and the epistle which he addressed to the senate, will
      best describe his situation and his sentiments. “Your election,
      Conscript Fathers! and the ordinance of the most valiant army,
      have made me your emperor. 36 May the propitious Deity direct and
      prosper the counsels and events of my administration, to your
      advantage and to the public welfare! For my own part, I did not
      aspire, I have submitted to reign; nor should I have discharged
      the obligations of a citizen if I had refused, with base and
      selfish ingratitude, to support the weight of those labors, which
      were imposed by the republic. Assist, therefore, the prince whom
      you have made; partake the duties which you have enjoined; and
      may our common endeavors promote the happiness of an empire,
      which I have accepted from your hands. Be assured, that, in our
      times, justice shall resume her ancient vigor, and that virtue
      shall become, not only innocent, but meritorious. Let none,
      except the authors themselves, be apprehensive of delations, 37
      which, as a subject, I have always condemned, and, as a prince,
      will severely punish. Our own vigilance, and that of our father,
      the patrician Ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs, and
      provide for the safety of the Roman world, which we have saved
      from foreign and domestic enemies. 38 You now understand the
      maxims of my government; you may confide in the faithful love and
      sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the
      companion of your life and dangers; who still glories in the name
      of senator, and who is anxious that you should never repent the
      judgment which you have pronounced in his favor.” The emperor,
      who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient
      language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have
      disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his
      own heart; since they were not suggested to his imitation by the
      customs of his age, or the example of his predecessors. 39

      more art than genius, and more labor than art. The ornaments are
      false and trivial; the expression is feeble and prolix; and
      Sidonius wants the skill to exhibit the principal figure in a
      strong and distinct light. The private life of Majorian occupies
      about two hundred lines, 107-305.]

      34 (return) [ She pressed his immediate death, and was scarcely

      by the latter, Majorian must understand the tyranny of Avitus;
      whose death he consequently avowed as a meritorious act. On this
      occasion, Sidonius is fearful and obscure; he describes the
      twelve Caesars, the nations of Africa, &c., that he may escape
      the dangerous name of Avitus (805-369.)]

      nostrum, bears some taint of the age, and does not mix kindly
      with the word respublica, which he frequently repeats.]

      The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly
      known: but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought
      and expression, faithfully represent the character of a sovereign
      who loved his people, who sympathized in their distress, who had
      studied the causes of the decline of the empire, and who was
      capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable)
      judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders. 40 His
      regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove,
      or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances. I. From
      the first hour of his reign, he was solicitous (I translate his
      own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials,
      oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and
      superindictions. 41 With this view he granted a universal
      amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of
      tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal
      officers might demand from the people. This wise dereliction of
      obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and
      purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject who
      could now look back without despair, might labor with hope and
      gratitude for himself and for his country. II. In the assessment
      and collection of taxes, Majorian restored the ordinary
      jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates; and suppressed the
      extraordinary commissions which had been introduced, in the name
      of the emperor himself, or of the Prætorian præfects. The
      favorite servants, who obtained such irregular powers, were
      insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands: they
      affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were
      discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the
      sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One
      instance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not
      authenticated by the legislator himself. They exacted the whole
      payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire,
      and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with
      the names of Faustina or the Antonines. The subject, who was
      unprovided with these curious medals, had recourse to the
      expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or if he
      succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled, according
      to the weight and value of the money of former times. 42 III.
      “The municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser
      senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be
      considered as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the
      republic. And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice
      of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their
      members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken
      refuge in distant and obscure exile.” He urges, and even compels,
      their return to their respective cities; but he removes the
      grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their
      municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of
      the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the
      tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum
      assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a
      regular account of the payments which they have actually
      received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the
      public. IV. But Majorian was not ignorant that these corporate
      bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and
      oppression which they had suffered; and he therefore revives the
      useful office of the defenders of cities. He exhorts the people
      to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and
      integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to
      represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny
      of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were
      committed under the sanction of his name and authority.

      one hundred and eighteen, and those of the fifth century only
      sixty-eight, English grains. Majorian gives currency to all gold
      coin, excepting only the Gallic solidus, from its deficiency, not
      in the weight, but in the standard.]

      The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of ancient
      Rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals,
      for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor
      perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The tempest of war might
      strike some lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction
      which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was
      prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period of ten
      centuries; and the motives of interest, that afterwards operated
      without shame or control, were severely checked by the taste and
      spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of the city had
      gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and
      theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the
      desires of the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of
      the Christians, were no longer inhabited, either by gods or men;
      the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense
      space of their baths and porticos; and the stately libraries and
      halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation, whose
      repose was seldom disturbed, either by study or business. The
      monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness were no longer
      revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were only
      esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more
      convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were
      continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which
      stated the want of stones or bricks, for some necessary service:
      the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced, for the
      sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate
      Romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument,
      demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors of their
      ancestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of
      the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. 43 He
      reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the
      extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient
      edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand
      pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should presume to grant
      such illegal and scandalous license, and threatened to chastise
      the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers, by a severe
      whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. In the last
      instance, the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of
      guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous
      principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of
      those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live.
      The emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the
      number of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the
      purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to
      accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and
      perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who consecrated
      their virginity to Christ, were restrained from taking the veil
      till they had reached their fortieth year. Widows under that age
      were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five
      years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest
      relations, or to the state. Unequal marriages were condemned or
      annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so
      inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal
      returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of
      Majorian, be slain with impunity. 44

      43 (return) [ The whole edict (Novell. Majorian. tit. vi. p. 35)

      nascitur, ut etiam unusquisque privatum aedificium construens,
      per gratiam judicum..... praesumere de publicis locis necessaria,
      et transferre non dubitet” &c. With equal zeal, but with less
      power, Petrarch, in the fourteenth century, repeated the same
      complaints. (Vie de Petrarque, tom. i. p. 326, 327.) If I
      prosecute this history, I shall not be unmindful of the decline
      and fall of the city of Rome; an interesting object to which any
      plan was originally confined.]

      44 (return) [ The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian, consular
      of Tuscany in a style of acrimonious reproof, which sounds almost
      like personal resentment, (Novell. tit. ix. p. 47.) The law of
      Majorian, which punished obstinate widows, was soon afterwards
      repealed by his successor Severus, (Novell. Sever. tit. i. p.
      37.)]

      While the emperor Majorian assiduously labored to restore the
      happiness and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of
      Genseric, from his character and situation their most formidable
      enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the
      Liris, or Garigliano; but the Imperial troops surprised and
      attacked the disorderly Barbarians, who were encumbered with the
      spoils of Campania; they were chased with slaughter to their
      ships, and their leader, the king’s brother-in-law, was found in
      the number of the slain. 45 Such vigilance might announce the
      character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the
      most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the
      long-extended coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval
      war. The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous
      task on the genius of Majorian. Rome expected from him alone the
      restitution of Africa; and the design, which he formed, of
      attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was the result of
      bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could have
      infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have
      revived in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had
      always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against
      Genseric at the head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of
      national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but
      it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a
      declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or
      to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,
      and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses. Majorian, like
      the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful
      expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place of
      his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be
      displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a
      dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it.
      Besides the confederates, who were already engaged in the service
      of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the
      nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the
      Tanais. Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila, the
      Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Burgundians, the Suevi,
      the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria; and their
      formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities. 46
      They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The emperor led the way,
      on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long staff,
      the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the Scythians, who
      complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that
      they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of
      Lyons had presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and
      experienced, the clemency of Majorian. He vanquished Theodoric in
      the field; and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king
      whom he had found not unworthy of his arms. The beneficial,
      though precarious, reunion of the greater part of Gaul and Spain,
      was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force; 47 and the
      independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the
      oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the
      virtues of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies;
      his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people;
      but the emperor had foreseen, that it was impossible, without a
      maritime power, to achieve the conquest of Africa. In the first
      Punic war, the republic had exerted such incredible diligence,
      that, within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had
      been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty
      galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea. 48 Under circumstances
      much less favorable, Majorian equalled the spirit and
      perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine
      were felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum
      were restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal
      contributions to the public service; and the Imperial navy of
      three hundred large galleys, with an adequate proportion of
      transports and smaller vessels, was collected in the secure and
      capacious harbor of Carthagena in Spain. 49 The intrepid
      countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a confidence of
      victory; and, if we might credit the historian Procopius, his
      courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence.
      Anxious to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the Vandals,
      he ventured, after disguising the color of his hair, to visit
      Carthage, in the character of his own ambassador: and Genseric
      was afterwards mortified by the discovery, that he had
      entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans. Such an
      anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction; but it is a
      fiction which would not have been imagined, unless in the life of
      a hero. 50

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part III.

      Without the help of a personal interview, Genseric was
      sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his
      adversary. He practiced his customary arts of fraud and delay,
      but he practiced them without success. His applications for peace
      became each hour more submissive, and perhaps more sincere; but
      the inflexible Majorian had adopted the ancient maxim, that Rome
      could not be safe, as long as Carthage existed in a hostile
      state. The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his native
      subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South; 51 he
      suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him
      as an Arian tyrant; and the desperate measure, which he executed,
      of reducing Mauritania into a desert, 52 could not defeat the
      operations of the Roman emperor, who was at liberty to land his
      troops on any part of the African coast. But Genseric was saved
      from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some
      powerful subjects, envious, or apprehensive, of their master’s
      success. Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the
      unguarded fleet in the Bay of Carthagena: many of the ships were
      sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years
      were destroyed in a single day. 53 After this event, the behavior
      of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. The
      Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory,
      immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. The emperor of
      the West, who was capable of forming great designs, and of
      supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or
      rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that,
      before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with
      provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy,
      to prosecute his labors for the public happiness; and, as he was
      conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of
      the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life. The
      recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had
      dazzled the eyes of the multitude; almost every description of
      civil and military officers were exasperated against the
      Reformer, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses
      which he endeavored to suppress; and the patrician Ricimer
      impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a
      prince whom he esteemed and hated. The virtues of Majorian could
      not protect him from the impetuous sedition, which broke out in
      the camp near Tortona, at the foot of the Alps. He was compelled
      to abdicate the Imperial purple: five days after his abdication,
      it was reported that he died of a dysentery; 54 and the humble
      tomb, which covered his remains, was consecrated by the respect
      and gratitude of succeeding generations. 55 The private character
      of Majorian inspired love and respect. Malicious calumny and
      satire excited his indignation, or, if he himself were the
      object, his contempt; but he protected the freedom of wit, and,
      in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of
      his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleasantry, without
      degrading the majesty of his rank. 56

      praising a deceased emperor: but a casual disinterested remark,
      “Subrisit Augustus; ut erat, auctoritate servata, cum se
      communioni dedisset, joci plenus,” outweighs the six hundred
      lines of his venal panegyric.]

      It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that Ricimer sacrificed
      his friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved, in a
      second choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior
      virtue and merit. At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome
      bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus, who ascended the
      throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a
      private condition. History has scarcely deigned to notice his
      birth, his elevation, his character, or his death. Severus
      expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron;
      57 and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in
      the vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian
      and the elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the
      government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the
      modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated
      treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances,
      and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority,
      which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric. But his
      dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman generals,
      Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the
      republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled
      an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and
      the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church
      and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of
      divination. But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of
      learning, virtue, and courage; 58 the study of the Latin
      literature had improved his taste; and his military talents had
      recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Ætius,
      in whose ruin he was involved. By a timely flight, Marcellinus
      escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty
      amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded
      by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army,
      stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals;
      but his Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor’s death, were
      tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the
      head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus
      occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician
      of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and
      equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the
      Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of
      Africa. 59 Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or
      at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome, 60 proclaimed
      his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved
      master. A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard:
      and, though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer, and the arms
      of the Visigoths, from marching to the gates of Rome, he
      maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps, and
      rendered the name of Aegidius, respectable both in peace and war.
      The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of
      Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king: his vanity,
      rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor;
      and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the
      injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he
      patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince. The
      authority of Aegidius ended only with his life, and the
      suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some
      countenance from the character of Ricimer, were eagerly
      entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls. 61

      The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was
      gradually reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of Ricimer, by
      the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates. 62 In the
      spring of each year, they equipped a formidable navy in the port
      of Carthage; and Genseric himself, though in a very advanced age,
      still commanded in person the most important expeditions. His
      designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment
      that he hoisted sail. When he was asked, by his pilot, what
      course he should steer, “Leave the determination to the winds,
      (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will
      transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked
      the divine justice;” but if Genseric himself deigned to issue
      more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most
      criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain,
      Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria,
      Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted
      to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the
      centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or
      terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As
      they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom
      attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in
      the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them,
      almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most
      distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they
      always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner
      landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light
      cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the
      native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and
      perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors
      was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa,
      enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired
      by the valor of their fathers. Their place was readily supplied
      by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and
      outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated
      the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the
      atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric. In the
      treatment of his unhappy prisoners, he sometimes consulted his
      avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of
      five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Zacynthus, whose mangled
      bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed, by the public
      indignation, to his latest posterity.

      Anthem. Carm. ii. 348-386) In one passage the poet seems inspired
      by his subject, and expresses a strong idea by a lively image:—

     Hinc Vandalus hostis Urget; et in nostrum numerosa classe
     quotannis Militat excidium; conversoque ordine Fati Torrida
     Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furores]

      Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; but the
      war, which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman
      empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive. The
      widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome
      to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house; her
      elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric,
      his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim,
      which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just
      proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at least a
      valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to
      purchase a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter,
      Placidia, were honorably restored, and the fury of the Vandals
      was confined to the limits of the Western empire. The Italians,
      destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting
      their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of
      the East; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the
      supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual divisions of the two empires
      had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of
      a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of
      arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and
      ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long
      struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length
      reduced to address the throne of Constantinople, in the humble
      language of a subject; and Italy submitted, as the price and
      security of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of
      the emperor of the East. 63 It is not the purpose of the present
      chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct
      series of the Byzantine history; but a concise view of the reign
      and character of the emperor Leo, may explain the last efforts
      that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West. 64

      distress of Ricimer:—

     Præterea invictus Ricimer, quem publica fata Respiciunt, proprio

      Italy addresses her complaint to the Tyber, and Rome, at the
      solicitation of the river god, transports herself to
      Constantinople, renounces her ancient claims, and implores the
      friendship of Aurora, the goddess of the East. This fabulous
      machinery, which the genius of Claudian had used and abused, is
      the constant and miserable resource of the muse of Sidonius.]

      64 (return) [ The original authors of the reigns of Marcian, Leo,
      and Zeno, are reduced to some imperfect fragments, whose
      deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations
      of Theophanes, Zonaras, and Cedrenus.]

      Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of
      Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction.
      Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on
      the modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august
      rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his
      people the example of the religious worship that was due to the
      memory of the Imperial saint. 65 Attentive to the prosperity of
      his own dominions, Marcian seemed to behold, with indifference,
      the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and
      active prince, to draw his sword against the Vandals, was
      ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been exacted
      from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric. 66 The
      death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have
      exposed the East to the danger of a popular election; if the
      superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline
      the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they
      supported. The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on
      his own head, if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed. 67
      During three generations, the armies of the East were
      successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son
      Ardaburius; his Barbarian guards formed a military force that
      overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution
      of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was
      powerful. He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a
      military tribune, and the principal steward of his household. His
      nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the
      servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of
      the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this
      unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity. 68 This emperor, the
      first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of
      the Great; from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed in
      the opinion of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic, or at
      least of royal, perfection. Yet the temperate firmness with which
      Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor, showed that he was
      conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was
      astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a
      præfect of Constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign
      with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking his purple, “It
      is not proper, (said he,) that the man who is invested with this
      garment, should be guilty of lying.” “Nor is it proper, (replied
      Leo,) that a prince should be compelled to resign his own
      judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject.”69
      After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the
      reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere;
      or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent. An army of
      Isaurians 70 was secretly levied, and introduced into
      Constantinople; and while Leo undermined the authority, and
      prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and
      cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate
      attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their
      enemies. The measures of peace and war were affected by this
      internal revolution. As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the
      throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest
      engaged him to favor the cause of Genseric. When Leo had
      delivered himself from that ignominious servitude, he listened to
      the complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny
      of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague,
      Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple
      of the West.

      Procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors. 71 But the
      merit of his immediate parents, their honors, and their riches,
      rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the
      East. His father, Procopius, obtained, after his Persian embassy,
      the rank of general and patrician; and the name of Anthemius was
      derived from his maternal grandfather, the celebrated præfect,
      who protected, with so much ability and success, the infant reign
      of Theodosius. The grandson of the præfect was raised above the
      condition of a private subject, by his marriage with Euphemia,
      the daughter of the emperor Marcian. This splendid alliance,
      which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the
      promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count, of
      master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or
      fortune claimed the honors of a victory, which was obtained on
      the banks of the Danube, over the Huns. Without indulging an
      extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of Marcian might hope to be
      his successor; but Anthemius supported the disappointment with
      courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was
      universally approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to
      reign, till he ascended the throne. 72 The emperor of the West
      marched from Constantinople, attended by several counts of high
      distinction, and a body of guards almost equal to the strength
      and numbers of a regular army: he entered Rome in triumph, and
      the choice of Leo was confirmed by the senate, the people, and
      the Barbarian confederates of Italy. 73 The solemn inauguration
      of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the
      patrician Ricimer; a fortunate event, which was considered as the
      firmest security of the union and happiness of the state. The
      wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many
      senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise
      their poverty. All serious business was suspended during this
      festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome,
      the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded
      with hymeneal songs and dances: and the royal bride, clothed in
      silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the
      palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the
      habit of a consul and a senator. On this memorable occasion,
      Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted,
      appeared as the orator of Auvergne, among the provincial deputies
      who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints. 74
      The calends of January were now approaching, and the venal poet,
      who had loved Avitus, and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his
      friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity,
      the second consulship, and the future triumphs, of the emperor
      Anthemius. Sidonius pronounced, with assurance and success, a
      panegyric which is still extant; and whatever might be the
      imperfections, either of the subject or of the composition, the
      welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the præfecture
      of Rome; a dignity which placed him among the illustrious
      personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the more
      respectable character of a bishop and a saint. 75

      The Greeks ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith of
      the emperor whom they gave to the West; nor do they forget to
      observe, that when he left Constantinople, he converted his
      palace into the pious foundation of a public bath, a church, and
      a hospital for old men. 76 Yet some suspicious appearances are
      found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius. From the
      conversation of Philotheus, a Macedonian sectary, he had imbibed
      the spirit of religious toleration; and the Heretics of Rome
      would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement
      censure which Pope Hilary pronounced in the church of St. Peter,
      had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence. 77 Even
      the Pagans, a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain
      hopes, from the indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and
      his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus, whom he
      promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project, of
      reviving the ancient worship of the gods. 78 These idols were
      crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the
      creed of nations, was so universally disbelieved, that it might
      be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion, by
      Christian poets. 79 Yet the vestiges of superstition were not
      absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the Lupercalia, whose
      origin had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated
      under the reign of Anthemius. The savage and simple rites were
      expressive of an early state of society before the invention of
      arts and agriculture. The rustic deities who presided over the
      toils and pleasures of the pastoral life, Pan, Faunus, and their
      train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might
      create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was
      limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. A goat was the
      offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the
      flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous
      youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields,
      with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was
      supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they
      touched. 80 The altar of Pan was erected, perhaps by Evander the
      Arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the Palantine hill,
      watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove. A
      tradition, that, in the same place, Romulus and Remus were
      suckled by the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable
      in the eyes of the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually
      surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum. 81 After the
      conversion of the Imperial city, the Christians still continued,
      in the month of February, the annual celebration of the
      Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious
      influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world.

      The bishops of Rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom,
      so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity; but their zeal was
      not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate: the
      inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and
      Pope Gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of
      idolatry, appeased by a formal apology, the murmurs of the senate
      and people. 82

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part IV.

      In all his public declarations, the emperor Leo assumes the
      authority, and professes the affection, of a father, for his son
      Anthemius, with whom he had divided the administration of the
      universe. 83 The situation, and perhaps the character, of Leo,
      dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers
      of an African war. But the powers of the Eastern empire were
      strenuously exerted to deliver Italy and the Mediterranean from
      the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long oppressed both the
      land and sea, was threatened from every side with a formidable
      invasion. The campaign was opened by a bold and successful
      enterprise of the præfect Heraclius. 84 The troops of Egypt,
      Thebais, and Libya, were embarked, under his command; and the
      Arabs, with a train of horses and camels, opened the roads of the
      desert. Heraclius landed on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and
      subdued the cities of that province, and prepared, by a laborious
      march, which Cato had formerly executed, 85 to join the Imperial
      army under the walls of Carthage. The intelligence of this loss
      extorted from Genseric some insidious and ineffectual
      propositions of peace; but he was still more seriously alarmed by
      the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The
      independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the
      legitimate title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey
      to Rome; the Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of
      Italy; the active valor of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from
      the Island of Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the West added
      some weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans.
      The expense of the naval armament, which Leo sent against the
      Vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious and
      instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire.
      The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied
      seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of
      gold, and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid
      into the treasury by the Prætorian præfects. But the cities
      were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of
      fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does
      not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration. The
      whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the
      African campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty
      thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two hundred thousand
      pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from
      the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat higher than
      in the present age. 86 The fleet that sailed from Constantinople
      to Carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, and
      the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand
      men. Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Vorina, was intrusted
      with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo, had
      exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the
      Scythians. But the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was
      reserved for the African war; and his friends could only save his
      military reputation by asserting, that he had conspired with
      Aspar to spare Genseric, and to betray the last hope of the
      Western empire.

      number of skins filled with water, and several Psylli, who were

      are less certain, and less important. The historian Malchus
      laments the public misery, (Excerpt. ex Suida in Corp. Hist.
      Byzant. p. 58;) but he is surely unjust, when he charges Leo with
      hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people. * Note:

      at 65,000 lbs. of gold, 700,000 of silver. But Lydus exaggerates
      the fleet to the incredible number of 10,000 long ships,
      (Liburnae,) and the troops to 400,000 men. Lydus describes this
      fatal measure, of which he charges the blame on Basiliscus, as
      the shipwreck of the state. From that time all the revenues of
      the empire were anticipated; and the finances fell into
      inextricable confusion.—M.]

      Experience has shown, that the success of an invader most
      commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his operations. The
      strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by
      delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in
      a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty effort
      which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed; and
      every hour that is wasted in negotiation, accustoms the enemy to
      contemplate and examine those hostile terrors, which, on their
      first appearance, he deemed irresistible. The formidable navy of
      Basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian
      Bosphorus to the coast of Africa. He landed his troops at Cape
      Bona, or the promontory of Mercury, about forty miles from
      Carthage. 87 The army of Heraclius, and the fleet of Marcellinus,
      either joined or seconded the Imperial lieutenant; and the
      Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land, were
      successively vanquished. 88 If Basiliscus had seized the moment
      of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, Carthage
      must have surrendered, and the kingdom of the Vandals was
      extinguished. Genseric beheld the danger with firmness, and
      eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He protested, in the most
      respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person, and
      his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requested a
      truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and
      it was universally believed, that his secret liberality
      contributed to the success of this public negotiation. Instead of
      obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly
      solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented to
      the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim,
      that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa.
      During this short interval, the wind became favorable to the
      designs of Genseric. He manned his largest ships of war with the
      bravest of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many
      large barks, filled with combustible materials. In the obscurity
      of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the
      unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened
      by the sense of their instant danger. Their close and crowded
      order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated
      with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind,
      the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers
      and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the
      horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they labored to extricate
      themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of
      the navy, the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate
      and disciplined valor; and many of the Romans, who escaped the
      fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious
      Vandals. Among the events of that disastrous night, the heroic,
      or rather desperate, courage of John, one of the principal
      officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion. When
      the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost consumed, he
      threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully rejected
      the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed
      him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves;
      exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall alive
      into the hands of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different
      spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from
      danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement,
      returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his
      fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of
      St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could
      obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Heraclius effected
      his retreat through the desert; Marcellinus retired to Sicily,
      where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer,
      by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed
      his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves should
      remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. 89 After
      the failure of this great expedition, 891 Genseric again became
      the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia,
      were again exposed to his revenge and avarice; Tripoli and
      Sardinia returned to his obedience; he added Sicily to the number
      of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness of years and
      of glory, he beheld the final extinction of the empire of the
      West. 90

      of these great naval armaments.]

      During his long and active reign, the African monarch had
      studiously cultivated the friendship of the Barbarians of Europe,
      whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual
      diversion against the two empires. After the death of Attila, he
      renewed his alliance with the Visigoths of Gaul; and the sons of
      the elder Theodoric, who successively reigned over that warlike
      nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense of interest, to
      forget the cruel affront which Genseric had inflicted on their
      sister. 91 The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric
      the Second from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honor; he
      violated his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample
      territory of Narbonne, which he firmly united to his dominions,
      became the immediate reward of his perfidy. The selfish policy of
      Ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the
      possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the
      defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, saved Gaul, and
      checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths.
      Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of
      extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived,
      and almost completed, in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his
      brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper,
      superior abilities, both in peace and war. He passed the Pyrenees
      at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of Saragossa
      and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the
      Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into the heart
      of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of
      Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain. 92 The efforts of
      Euric were not less vigorous, or less successful, in Gaul; and
      throughout the country that extends from the Pyrenees to the
      Rhone and the Loire, Berry and Auvergne were the only cities, or
      dioceses, which refused to acknowledge him as their master. 93 In
      the defence of Clermont, their principal town, the inhabitants of
      Auvergne sustained, with inflexible resolution, the miseries of
      war, pestilence, and famine; and the Visigoths, relinquishing the
      fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of that important conquest.
      The youth of the province were animated by the heroic, and almost
      incredible, valor of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor Avitus, 94
      who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen, boldly
      attacked the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying
      skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of
      Clermont. His charity was equal to his courage: in a time of
      extreme scarcity, four thousand poor were fed at his expense; and
      his private influence levied an army of Burgundians for the
      deliverance of Auvergne. From his virtues alone the faithful
      citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom; and even
      such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of
      their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his
      authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative
      of exile or servitude. 95 The public confidence was lost; the
      resources of the state were exhausted; and the Gauls had too much
      reason to believe, that Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was
      incapable of protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps.
      The feeble emperor could only procure for their defence the
      service of twelve thousand British auxiliaries. Riothamus, one of
      the independent kings, or chieftains, of the island, was
      persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul: he
      sailed up the Loire, and established his quarters in Berry, where
      the people complained of these oppressive allies, till they were
      destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths. 96

      One of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the Roman senate
      exercised over their subjects of Gaul, was the trial and
      condemnation of Arvandus, the Prætorian præfect. Sidonius, who
      rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and
      assist a state criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and
      freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend. 97
      From the perils which he had escaped, Arvandus imbibed confidence
      rather than wisdom; and such was the various, though uniform,
      imprudence of his behavior, that his prosperity must appear much
      more surprising than his downfall. The second præfecture, which
      he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit
      and popularity of his preceding administration. His easy temper
      was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he was
      forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of
      the province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of
      Gaul, and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred. The
      mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct
      before the senate; and he passed the Sea of Tuscany with a
      favorable wind, the presage, as he vainly imagined, of his future
      fortunes. A decent respect was still observed for the
      Proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was
      committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of
      Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided
      in the Capitol. 98 He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the
      four deputies of Gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth,
      their dignities, or their eloquence. In the name of a great
      province, and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence, they
      instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such
      restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and
      such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state. Their
      charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they
      placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
      intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his
      secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself. The author
      of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a
      peace with the Greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the
      Britons on the Loire; and he recommended a division of Gaul,
      according to the law of nations, between the Visigoths and the
      Burgundians. 99 These pernicious schemes, which a friend could
      only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were
      susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had
      artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons
      till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions
      were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised
      the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented,
      without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of
      Arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of
      his friends. Ignorant of his real situation, Arvandus showed
      himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate, accepted
      indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the
      shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with the
      indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of
      a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the
      prince, and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon
      removed. An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus
      appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous assembly of the
      Roman senate. The mournful garb which they affected, excited the
      compassion of the judges, who were scandalized by the gay and
      splendid dress of their adversary: and when the præfect
      Arvandus, with the first of the Gallic deputies, were directed to
      take their places on the senatorial benches, the same contrast of
      pride and modesty was observed in their behavior. In this
      memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old
      republic, the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the
      grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the
      audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal
      epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange
      supposition, that a subject could not be convicted of treason,
      unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple. As the
      paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice,
      acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment
      was equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate
      declared him guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was
      degraded from the rank of a præfect to the obscure condition of
      a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the
      public prison. After a fortnight’s adjournment, the senate was
      again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death; but while
      he expected, in the Island of Aesculapius, the expiration of the
      thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors,
      100 his friends interposed, the emperor Anthemius relented, and
      the præfect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and
      confiscation. The faults of Arvandus might deserve compassion;
      but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice of the
      republic, till he was condemned and executed, on the complaint of
      the people of Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of
      his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the
      Visigoths, to betray the province which he oppressed: his
      industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes
      and obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have
      inspired contempt, if they had not excited fear and abhorrence.

      Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever
      might be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful Barbarian was able
      to contend or to negotiate with the prince, whose alliance he had
      condescended to accept. The peaceful and prosperous reign which
      Anthemius had promised to the West, was soon clouded by
      misfortune and discord. Ricimer, apprehensive, or impatient, of a
      superior, retired from Rome, and fixed his residence at Milan; an
      advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike
      tribes that were seated between the Alps and the Danube. 102
      Italy was gradually divided into two independent and hostile
      kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near
      approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the
      patrician, and conjured him to spare their unhappy country. “For
      my own part,” replied Ricimer, in a tone of insolent moderation,
      “I am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the Galatian;
      103 but who will undertake to appease his anger, or to mitigate
      the pride, which always rises in proportion to our submission?”
      They informed him, that Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia, 104 united
      the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; and
      appeared confident, that the eloquence of such an ambassador must
      prevail against the strongest opposition, either of interest or
      passion. Their recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius,
      assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without
      delay to Rome, where he was received with the honors due to his
      merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favor of peace
      may be easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible
      circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of
      mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished
      the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce Barbarian, which
      might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions.
      Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply
      felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior of Ricimer, and
      his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse. “What
      favors,” he warmly exclaimed, “have we refused to this ungrateful
      man? What provocations have we not endured! Regardless of the
      majesty of the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed
      my own blood to the safety of the republic. The liberality which
      ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has
      exasperated him against his benefactor. What wars has he not
      excited against the empire! How often has he instigated and
      assisted the fury of hostile nations! Shall I now accept his
      perfidious friendship? Can I hope that he will respect the
      engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a
      son?” But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate
      exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of
      Epiphanius; and the bishop returned to his diocese with the
      satisfaction of restoring the peace of Italy, by a
      reconciliation, 105 of which the sincerity and continuance might
      be reasonably suspected. The clemency of the emperor was extorted
      from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs
      till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved
      to subvert the throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and
      moderation was then thrown aside. The army of Ricimer was
      fortified by a numerous reenforcement of Burgundians and Oriental
      Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor, marched
      from Milan to the Gates of Rome, and fixing his camp on the banks
      of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his
      Imperial candidate.

      Western empire.]

      The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem himself
      the lawful heir of the Western empire. He had married Placidia,
      the younger daughter of Valentinian, after she was restored by
      Genseric; who still detained her sister Eudoxia, as the wife, or
      rather as the captive, of his son. The king of the Vandals
      supported, by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of
      his Roman ally; and assigned, as one of the motives of the war,
      the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful
      prince, and the unworthy preference which they had given to a
      stranger. 106 The friendship of the public enemy might render
      Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians; but when Ricimer
      meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted, with the
      offer of a diadem, the candidate who could justify his rebellion
      by an illustrious name and a royal alliance. The husband of
      Placidia, who, like most of his ancestors, had been invested with
      the consular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a secure and
      splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor
      does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot
      be amused or occupied, unless by the administration of an empire.
      Yet Olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends, perhaps
      of his wife; rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a
      civil war; and, with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo,
      accepted the Italian purple, which was bestowed, and resumed, at
      the capricious will of a Barbarian. He landed without obstacle
      (for Genseric was master of the sea) either at Ravenna, or the
      port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer,
      where he was received as the sovereign of the Western world. 107

      and the Paschal Chronicle. We are ignorant of his motives; but in
      this obscure period, our ignorance extends to the most public and
      important facts.]

      The patrician, who had extended his posts from the Anio to the
      Melvian bridge, already possessed two quarters of Rome, the
      Vatican and the Janiculum, which are separated by the Tyber from
      the rest of the city; 108 and it may be conjectured, that an
      assembly of seceding senators imitated, in the choice of
      Olybrius, the forms of a legal election. But the body of the
      senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of Anthemius; and
      the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him to
      prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of
      three months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and
      pestilence. At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the
      bridge of Hadrian, or St. Angelo; and the narrow pass was
      defended with equal valor by the Goths, till the death of
      Gilimer, their leader. The victorious troops, breaking down every
      barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the
      city, and Rome (if we may use the language of a contemporary
      pope) was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius and Ricimer.
      109 The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his concealment,
      and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law; who
      thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of
      his victims. The soldiers, who united the rage of factious
      citizens with the savage manners of Barbarians, were indulged,
      without control, in the license of rapine and murder: the crowd
      of slaves and plebeians, who were unconcerned in the event, could
      only gain by the indiscriminate pillage; and the face of the city
      exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute
      intemperance. 110 Forty days after this calamitous event, the
      subject, not of glory, but of guilt, Italy was delivered, by a
      painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed the
      command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, one of the princes
      of the Burgundians. In the same year all the principal actors in
      this great revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole
      reign of Olybrius, whose death does not betray any symptoms of
      violence, is included within the term of seven months. He left
      one daughter, the offspring of his marriage with Placidia; and
      the family of the great Theodosius, transplanted from Spain to
      Constantinople, was propagated in the female line as far as the
      eighth generation. 111

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part V.

      Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless
      Barbarians, 112 the election of a new colleague was seriously
      agitated in the council of Leo. The empress Verina, studious to
      promote the greatness of her own family, had married one of her
      nieces to Julius Nepos, who succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in
      the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more solid possession than the
      title which he was persuaded to accept, of Emperor of the West.
      But the measures of the Byzantine court were so languid and
      irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of
      Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor
      could show himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian
      subjects. During that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier,
      was invested with the purple by his patron Gundobald; but the
      Burgundian prince was unable, or unwilling, to support his
      nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition
      recalled him beyond the Alps, 113 and his client was permitted to
      exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of Salona. After
      extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was
      acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the
      provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents,
      were loudly celebrated; and those who derived any private benefit
      from his government, announced, in prophetic strains, the
      restoration of the public felicity. 114 Their hopes (if such
      hopes had been entertained) were confounded within the term of a
      single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded Auvergue to the
      Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious reign.
      The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed, by the
      Italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; 115 but his
      repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian
      confederates, who, under the command of Orestes, their general,
      were in full march from Rome to Ravenna. Nepos trembled at their
      approach; and, instead of placing a just confidence in the
      strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired
      to his Dalmatian principality, on the opposite coast of the
      Adriatic. By this shameful abdication, he protracted his life
      about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor
      and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by the
      ungrateful Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward
      of his crime, to the archbishopric of Milan. 116

      The nations who had asserted their independence after the death
      of Attila, were established, by the right of possession or
      conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the Danube;
      or in the Roman provinces between the river and the Alps. But the
      bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of confederates, who
      formed the defence and the terror of Italy; 117 and in this
      promiscuous multitude, the names of the Heruli, the Scyrri, the
      Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians, appear to have
      predominated. The example of these warriors was imitated by
      Orestes, 118 the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last
      Roman emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already
      mentioned in this History, had never deserted his country. His
      birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious
      subjects of Pannonia. When that province was ceded to the Huns,
      he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign,
      obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent
      ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and
      signify the commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that
      conqueror restored him to his freedom; and Orestes might
      honorably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the
      Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the
      dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service of the Italian
      princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed the
      qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced
      with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was
      elevated, by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of
      patrician, and master-general of the troops. These troops had
      been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of
      Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their
      own language, and was intimately connected with their national
      chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship. At his
      solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek, who
      presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes, from some
      secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same
      facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the
      West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the
      summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the
      end of the first year, that the lessons of perjury and
      ingratitude, which a rebel must inculcate, will be resorted to
      against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was
      only permitted to choose, whether he would be the slave, or the
      victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of
      these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of
      Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and
      privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a
      still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their
      brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had
      acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they
      insisted on their peremptory demand, that a third part of the
      lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them. Orestes,
      with a spirit, which, in another situation, might be entitled to
      our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed
      multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He
      rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to
      the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his
      fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his
      command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied
      to their dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garrisons of
      Italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the
      same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular
      leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the
      torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the
      episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately
      besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged;
      and although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some
      success, to save the property of the church, and the chastity of
      female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the
      execution of Orestes. 119 His brother Paul was slain in an action
      near Ravenna; and the helpless Augustulus, who could no longer
      command the respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of
      Odoacer.

      historians, represent Odoacer in the false light of a stranger,
      and a king, who invaded Italy with an army of foreigners, his
      native subjects.]

      That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some
      remarkable transactions, particularly described in a preceding
      chapter, had been the colleague of Orestes himself. 1191 The
      honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion; and
      Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his
      sovereign. But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or
      repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the
      favor of Attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded,
      in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of Scyrri,
      his immediate and hereditary subjects. In the revolt of the
      nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and more than twelve
      years afterwards, the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned, in
      their unequal contests with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated,
      after two bloody battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the
      Scyrri. 120 Their gallant leader, who did not survive this
      national calamity, left two sons, Onulf and Odoacer, to struggle
      with adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or
      service, the faithful followers of their exile. Onulf directed
      his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the
      assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had
      acquired in arms. His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among
      the Barbarians of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to
      the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed his choice,
      he piously visited the cell of Severinus, the popular saint of
      the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing. The lowness
      of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was
      obliged to stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could
      discern the symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him
      in a prophetic tone, “Pursue” (said he) “your design; proceed to
      Italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins; and
      your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind.” 121
      The Barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the
      prediction, was admitted into the service of the Western empire,
      and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards. His manners
      were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the
      confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their
      general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high
      opinion of his courage and capacity. 122 Their military
      acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he
      abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and
      diadem, 123 lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects,
      by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army,
      which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.

      Royalty was familiar to the Barbarians, and the submissive people
      of Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority
      which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the
      emperor of the West. But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that
      useless and expensive office; and such is the weight of antique
      prejudice, that it required some boldness and penetration to
      discover the extreme facility of the enterprise. The unfortunate
      Augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace: he
      signified his resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in
      their last act of obedience to a Roman prince, still affected the
      spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution. An epistle
      was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno,
      the son-in-law and successor of Leo; who had lately been
      restored, after a short rebellion, to the Byzantine throne. They
      solemnly “disclaim the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing
      any longer the Imperial succession in Italy; since, in their
      opinion, the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade
      and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West. In
      their own name, and in the name of the people, they consent that
      the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to
      Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing
      their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority
      which had given laws to the world. The republic (they repeat that
      name without a blush) might safely confide in the civil and
      military virtues of Odoacer; and they humbly request, that the
      emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician, and the
      administration of the diocese of Italy.” The deputies of the
      senate were received at Constantinople with some marks of
      displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the
      audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment
      of the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had
      successively granted to the prayers of Italy. “The first”
      (continued he) “you have murdered; the second you have expelled;
      but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your
      lawful sovereign.” But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the
      hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity was
      gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues
      erected to his honor in the several quarters of Rome; he
      entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the
      patrician Odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the Imperial
      ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the
      Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the
      people. 124

      the extract from Candidus, (apud Phot. p. 176,) are likewise of
      some use.]

      In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, nine
      emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a
      youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled
      to the notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the
      extinction of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a
      memorable era in the history of mankind. 125 The patrician
      Orestes had married the daughter of Count Romulus, of Petovio in
      Noricum: the name of Augustus, notwithstanding the jealousy of
      power, was known at Aquileia as a familiar surname; and the
      appellations of the two great founders, of the city and of the
      monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their
      successors. 126 The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the
      names of Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into
      Momyllus, by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the
      Latins into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus. The life of
      this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of
      Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the
      Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six thousand
      pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in Campania,
      for the place of his exile or retirement. 127 As soon as the
      Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were
      attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the
      country-house of the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting
      model of their rustic simplicity. 128 The delicious shores of the
      Bay of Naples were crowded with villas; and Sylla applauded the
      masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the lofty
      promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and
      land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon. 129 The villa of
      Marius was purchased, within a few years, by Lucullus, and the
      price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to more than
      fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. 130 It was adorned by the
      new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures; and the
      houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in
      the list of Imperial palaces. 131 When the Vandals became
      formidable to the sea-coast, the Lucullan villa, on the
      promontory of Misenum, gradually assumed the strength and
      appellation of a strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last
      emperor of the West. About twenty years after that great
      revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to
      receive the bones of St. Severinus. They securely reposed, amidst
      the the broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories,till
      the beginning of the tenth century; when the fortifications,
      which might afford a dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were
      demolished by the people of Naples. 132

      the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the
      laws, of the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil
      discord, and both the city and the province became the servile
      property of a tyrant. The forms of the constitution, which
      alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by
      time and violence; the Italians alternately lamented the presence
      or the absence of the sovereign, whom they detested or despised;
      and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils
      of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate
      oppression. During the same period, the Barbarians had emerged
      from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and
      Scythia were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the
      allies, and at length the masters, of the Romans, whom they
      insulted or protected. The hatred of the people was suppressed by
      fear; they respected the spirit and splendor of the martial
      chiefs who were invested with the honors of the empire; and the
      fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable
      strangers. The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of Italy,
      had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
      and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge
      the royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors. The king of
      Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and
      fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the
      habits of conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and
      a Barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his
      subjects. After an interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the
      consulship of the West. For himself, he modestly, or proudly,
      declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the
      East; but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of
      the most illustrious senators; 133 and the list is adorned by the
      respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues claimed the
      friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his client. 134 The
      laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil
      administration of Italy was still exercised by the Prætorian
      præfect and his subordinate officers. Odoacer devolved on the
      Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting
      the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of
      seasonable and popular indulgence. 135 Like the rest of the
      Barbarians, he had been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he
      revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of
      the Catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed. The peace
      of the city required the interposition of his præfect Basilius
      in the choice of a Roman pontiff: the decree which restrained the
      clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for
      the benefit of the people, whose devotions would have been taxed
      to repair the dilapidations of the church. 136 Italy was
      protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were
      respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long
      insulted the feeble race of Theodosius. Odoacer passed the
      Adriatic, to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to
      acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia. He passed the Alps, to
      rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king of
      the Rugians, who held his residence beyond the Danube. The king
      was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a numerous
      colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into Italy; and
      Rome, after a long period of defeat and disgrace, might claim the
      triumph of her Barbarian master. 137

      antiquities]

      Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom
      exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation. Since the
      age of Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy;
      and it was a just subject of complaint, that the life of the
      Roman people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves.
      138 In the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary
      harvests of Egypt and Africa were withdrawn; the numbers of the
      inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence;
      and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war,
      famine, 139 and pestilence. St. Ambrose has deplored the ruin of
      a populous district, which had been once adorned with the
      flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Regium, and Placentia. 140
      Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms, with
      strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent
      provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. 141 The
      plebeians of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master,
      perished or disappeared, as soon as his liberality was
      suppressed; the decline of the arts reduced the industrious
      mechanic to idleness and want; and the senators, who might
      support with patience the ruin of their country, bewailed their
      private loss of wealth and luxury. 1411 One third of those ample
      estates, to which the ruin of Italy is originally imputed, 142
      was extorted for the use of the conquerors. Injuries were
      aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was
      imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands
      were allotted to the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was
      apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his
      favorite villa, or his most profitable farm. The least
      unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the
      power which it was impossible to resist. Since they desired to
      live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their
      lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes,
      the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and
      voluntary gift. 143 The distress of Italy 1431 was mitigated by
      the prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as
      the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a
      licentious and turbulent multitude. The kings of the Barbarians
      were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native
      subjects, and the various bands of Italian mercenaries, who
      associated under the standard of an elective general, claimed a
      larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy destitute of
      national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
      dissolution. After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was
      oppressed by the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the
      Ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of
      government, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and
      whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.

     Origin Progress, And Effects Of The Monastic Life.— Conversion Of
     The Barbarians To Christianity And Arianism.— Persecution Of The
     Vandals In Africa.—Extinction Of Arianism Among The Barbarians.

      The indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs
      has compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the
      persecutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final
      triumph, and the gradual corruption, of Christianity. I have
      purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events,
      interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the
      decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The institution of the
      monastic life; 1 and, II. The conversion of the northern
      Barbarians.

      1 (return) [ The origin of the monastic institution has been
      laboriously discussed by Thomassin (Discipline de l’Eglise, tom.
      i. p. 1119-1426) and Helyot, (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom.

      full extent. Yet the cautious Protestant, who distrusts any
      popish guides, may consult the seventh book of Bingham’s
      Christian Antiquities.]

      I. Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar
      and the Ascetic Christians. 2 The loose and imperfect practice of
      religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude. The prince or
      magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent
      zeal, and implicit faith, with the exercise of their profession,
      the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their
      passions: but the Ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid
      precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm
      which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They
      seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age;
      abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised
      their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of
      misery, as the price of eternal happiness. In the reign of
      Constantine, the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate
      world, to perpetual solitude, or religious society. Like the
      first Christians of Jerusalem, 3 311 they resigned the use, or
      the property of their temporal possessions; established regular
      communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and
      assumed the names of Hermits, Monks, and Anachorets, expressive
      of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. They
      soon acquired the respect of the world, which they despised; and
      the loudest applause was bestowed on this Divine Philosophy, 4
      which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason, the
      laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The monks might indeed
      contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and
      of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were revived in
      their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as the
      Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society.
      But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a
      purer and more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the
      prophets, who had retired to the desert; 5 and they restored the
      devout and contemplative life, which had been instituted by the
      Essenians, in Palestine and Egypt. The philosophic eye of Pliny
      had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among
      the palm-trees near the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money,
      who were propagated without women; and who derived from the
      disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual supply of voluntary
      associates. 6

      Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first
      example of the monastic life. Antony, 7 an illiterate 8 youth of
      the lower parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, 9 deserted
      his family and native home, and executed his monastic penance
      with original and intrepid fanaticism. After a long and painful
      novitiate, among the tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly
      advanced into the desert three days’ journey to the eastward of
      the Nile; discovered a lonely spot, which possessed the
      advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last residence on
      Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea; where an ancient monastery still
      preserves the name and memory of the saint. 10 The curious
      devotion of the Christians pursued him to the desert; and when he
      was obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he
      supported his fame with discretion and dignity. He enjoyed the
      friendship of Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the
      Egyptian peasant respectfully declined a respectful invitation
      from the emperor Constantine. The venerable patriarch (for Antony
      attained the age of one hundred and five years) beheld the
      numerous progeny which had been formed by his example and his
      lessons. The prolific colonies of monks multiplied with rapid
      increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of Thebais, and in
      the cities of the Nile. To the south of Alexandria, the mountain,
      and adjacent desert, of Nitria, were peopled by five thousand
      anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of
      fifty monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the
      disciples of Antony. 11 In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island
      of Tabenne, 12 was occupied by Pachomius and fourteen hundred of
      his brethren. That holy abbot successively founded nine
      monasteries of men, and one of women; and the festival of Easter
      sometimes collected fifty thousand religious persons, who
      followed his angelic rule of discipline. 13 The stately and
      populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of Christian orthodoxy, had
      devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the ramparts,
      to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach in
      twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty
      thousand males, of the monastic profession. 14 The Egyptians, who
      gloried in this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and
      to believe, that the number of the monks was equal to the
      remainder of the people; 15 and posterity might repeat the
      saying, which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of
      the same country, That in Egypt it was less difficult to find a
      god than a man.

      especially the matrons, transformed their palaces and villas into
      religious houses; and the narrow institution of six vestals was
      eclipsed by the frequent monasteries, which were seated on the
      ruins of ancient temples, and in the midst of the Roman forum. 16
      Inflamed by the example of Antony, a Syrian youth, whose name was
      Hilarion, 17 fixed his dreary abode on a sandy beach, between the
      sea and a morass, about seven miles from Gaza. The austere
      penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused a
      similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of
      two or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the
      innumerable monasteries of Palestine. The fame of Basil 18 is
      immortal in the monastic history of the East. With a mind that
      had tasted the learning and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition
      scarcely to be satisfied with the archbishopric of Caesarea,
      Basil retired to a savage solitude in Pontus; and deigned, for a
      while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely
      scattered along the coast of the Black Sea. In the West, Martin
      of Tours, 19 a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,
      established the monasteries of Gaul; two thousand of his
      disciples followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian
      challenges the deserts of Thebais to produce, in a more favorable
      climate, a champion of equal virtue. The progress of the monks
      was not less rapid, or universal, than that of Christianity
      itself. Every province, and, at last, every city, of the empire,
      was filled with their increasing multitudes; and the bleak and
      barren isles, from Lerins to Lipari, that arose out of the Tuscan
      Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their
      voluntary exile. An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and
      land connected the provinces of the Roman world; and the life of
      Hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of
      Palestine might traverse Egypt, embark for Sicily, escape to
      Epirus, and finally settle in the Island of Cyprus. 20 The Latin
      Christians embraced the religious institutions of Rome. The
      pilgrims, who visited Jerusalem, eagerly copied, in the most
      distant climates of the earth, the faithful model of the monastic
      life. The disciples of Antony spread themselves beyond the
      tropic, over the Christian empire of Æthiopia. 21 The monastery
      of Banchor, 22 in Flintshire, which contained above two thousand
      brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the Barbarians of
      Ireland; 23 and Iona, one of the Hebrides, which was planted by
      the Irish monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful
      ray of science and superstition. 24

      These unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark
      and implacable genius of superstition. Their mutual resolution
      was supported by the example of millions, of either sex, of every
      age, and of every rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates
      of a monastery, was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny
      path of eternal happiness. 25 But the operation of these
      religious motives was variously determined by the temper and
      situation of mankind. Reason might subdue, or passion might
      suspend, their influence: but they acted most forcibly on the
      infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by
      secret remorse, or accidental misfortune; and they might derive
      some aid from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest.
      It was naturally supposed, that the pious and humble monks, who
      had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their
      salvation, were the best qualified for the spiritual government
      of the Christians. The reluctant hermit was torn from his cell,
      and seated, amidst the acclamations of the people, on the
      episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the
      East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and
      ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the
      possession of wealth and honors. 26 The popular monks, whose
      reputation was connected with the fame and success of the order,
      assiduously labored to multiply the number of their
      fellow-captives. They insinuated themselves into noble and
      opulent families; and the specious arts of flattery and seduction
      were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth
      or dignity on the monastic profession. The indignant father
      bewailed the loss, perhaps, of an only son; 27 the credulous maid
      was betrayed by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the
      matron aspired to imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues
      of domestic life. Paula yielded to the persuasive eloquence of
      Jerom; 28 and the profane title of mother-in-law of God 29
      tempted that illustrious widow to consecrate the virginity of her
      daughter Eustochium. By the advice, and in the company, of her
      spiritual guide, Paula abandoned Rome and her infant son; retired
      to the holy village of Bethlem; founded a hospital and four
      monasteries; and acquired, by her alms and penance, an eminent
      and conspicuous station in the Catholic church. Such rare and
      illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of
      their age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure
      and abject plebeians, 30 who gained in the cloister much more
      than they had sacrificed in the world. Peasants, slaves, and
      mechanics, might escape from poverty and contempt to a safe and
      honorable profession; whose apparent hardships are mitigated by
      custom, by popular applause, and by the secret relaxation of
      discipline. 31 The subjects of Rome, whose persons and fortunes
      were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant tributes,
      retired from the oppression of the Imperial government; and the
      pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the
      dangers of a military, life. The affrighted provincials of every
      rank, who fled before the Barbarians, found shelter and
      subsistence: whole legions were buried in these religious
      sanctuaries; and the same cause, which relieved the distress of
      individuals, impaired the strength and fortitude of the empire.

      The monastic profession of the ancients 33 was an act of
      voluntary devotion. The inconstant fanatic was threatened with
      the eternal vengeance of the God whom he deserted; but the doors
      of the monastery were still open for repentance. Those monks,
      whose conscience was fortified by reason or passion, were at
      liberty to resume the character of men and citizens; and even the
      spouses of Christ might accept the legal embraces of an earthly
      lover. 34 The examples of scandal, and the progress of
      superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible
      restraints. After a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice
      was secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable
      engagement was ratified by the laws of the church and state. A
      guilty fugitive was pursued, arrested, and restored to his
      perpetual prison; and the interposition of the magistrate
      oppressed the freedom and the merit, which had alleviated, in
      some degree, the abject slavery of the monastic discipline. 35
      The actions of a monk, his words, and even his thoughts, were
      determined by an inflexible rule, 36 or a capricious superior:
      the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or confinement,
      extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and disobedience,
      murmur, or delay, were ranked in the catalogue of the most
      heinous sins. 37 A blind submission to the commands of the abbot,
      however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling
      principle, the first virtue of the Egyptian monks; and their
      patience was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials.
      They were directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to
      water a barren staff, that was planted in the ground, till, at
      the end of three years, it should vegetate and blossom like a
      tree; to walk into a fiery furnace; or to cast their infant into
      a deep pond: and several saints, or madmen, have been
      immortalized in monastic story, by their thoughtless and fearless
      obedience. 38 The freedom of the mind, the source of every
      generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of
      credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the vices of
      a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his
      ecclesiastical tyrant. The peace of the Eastern church was
      invaded by a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or
      humanity; and the Imperial troops acknowledged, without shame,
      that they were much less apprehensive of an encounter with the
      fiercest Barbarians. 39

      Superstition has often framed and consecrated the fantastic
      garments of the monks: 40 but their apparent singularity
      sometimes proceeds from their uniform attachment to a simple and
      primitive model, which the revolutions of fashion have made
      ridiculous in the eyes of mankind. The father of the Benedictines
      expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit; and soberly
      exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of
      the countries which they may inhabit. 41 The monastic habits of
      the ancients varied with the climate, and their mode of life; and
      they assumed, with the same indifference, the sheep-skin of the
      Egyptian peasants, or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers. They
      allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt, where it was a
      cheap and domestic manufacture; but in the West they rejected
      such an expensive article of foreign luxury. 42 It was the
      practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair; they
      wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the sight of profane
      objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the extreme
      cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported by
      a long staff. The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and
      disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought
      acceptable to God; and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the
      salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing
      them with oil. 43 431 The austere monks slept on the ground, on a
      hard mat, or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves
      served them as a seat in the day, and a pillow in the night.
      Their original cells were low, narrow huts, built of the
      slightest materials; which formed, by the regular distribution of
      the streets, a large and populous village, enclosing, within the
      common wall, a church, a hospital, perhaps a library, some
      necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or reservoir of fresh

      Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the
      monks, and they discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts, and
      abstemious diet, are the most effectual preservatives against the
      impure desires of the flesh. 44 The rules of abstinence which
      they imposed, or practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the
      cheerful festival of the Pentecost was balanced by the
      extraordinary mortification of Lent; the fervor of new
      monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious appetite of
      the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of
      the Egyptians. 45 The disciples of Antony and Pachomius were
      satisfied with their daily pittance, 46 of twelve ounces of
      bread, or rather biscuit, 47 which they divided into two frugal
      repasts, of the afternoon and of the evening. It was esteemed a
      merit, and almost a duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables
      which were provided for the refectory; but the extraordinary
      bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of
      cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried fish of the Nile. 48 A
      more ample latitude of sea and river fish was gradually allowed
      or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or
      travellers; and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid
      monasteries of Europe, a singular distinction was introduced; as
      if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than
      the grosser animals of the field. Water was the pure and innocent
      beverage of the primitive monks; and the founder of the
      Benedictines regrets the daily portion of half a pint of wine,
      which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age.
      49 Such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyards of
      Italy; and his victorious disciples, who passed the Alps, the
      Rhine, and the Baltic, required, in the place of wine, an
      adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.

      The candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty,
      abjured, at his first entrance into a regular community, the
      idea, and even the name, of all separate or exclusive
      possessions. 50 The brethren were supported by their manual
      labor; and the duty of labor was strenuously recommended as a
      penance, as an exercise, and as the most laudable means of
      securing their daily subsistence. 51 The garden and fields, which
      the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or
      the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands. They
      performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and
      domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide
      their habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised
      within the precincts of the great monasteries. The monastic
      studies have tended, for the most part, to darken, rather than to
      dispel, the cloud of superstition. Yet the curiosity or zeal of
      some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical, and
      even the profane, sciences; and posterity must gratefully
      acknowledge, that the monuments of Greek and Roman literature
      have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens.
      52 But the more humble industry of the monks, especially in
      Egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation of
      making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree
      into mats and baskets. The superfluous stock, which was not
      consumed in domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the
      community: the boats of Tabenne, and the other monasteries of
      Thebais, descended the Nile as far as Alexandria; and, in a

      the studies of the monks; and we shall not be scandalized, if

      The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints, in
      whose society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life;
      and the pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to
      receive, for their use, any future accessions of legacy or
      inheritance. 53 Melania contributed her plate, three hundred
      pounds weight of silver; and Paula contracted an immense debt,
      for the relief of their favorite monks; who kindly imparted the
      merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and liberal sinner.
      54 Time continually increased, and accidents could seldom
      diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread
      over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the first century
      of their institution, the infidel Zosimus has maliciously
      observed, that, for the benefit of the poor, the Christian monks
      had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary. 55 As
      long as they maintained their original fervor, they approved
      themselves, however, the faithful and benevolent stewards of the
      charity, which was entrusted to their care. But their discipline
      was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed the pride of
      wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense. Their public
      luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship,
      and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an
      immortal society. But every age of the church has accused the
      licentiousness of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered
      the object of their institution, embraced the vain and sensual
      pleasures of the world, which they had renounced, 56 and
      scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the
      austere virtues of their founders. 57 Their natural descent, from
      such painful and dangerous virtue, to the common vices of
      humanity, will not, perhaps, excite much grief or indignation in
      the mind of a philosopher.

      The lives of the primitive monks were consumed in penance and
      solitude; undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the
      time, and exercise the faculties, of reasonable, active, and
      social beings. Whenever they were permitted to step beyond the
      precincts of the monastery, two jealous companions were the
      mutual guards and spies of each other’s actions; and, after their
      return, they were condemned to forget, or, at least, to suppress,
      whatever they had seen or heard in the world. Strangers, who
      professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained in a
      separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was
      restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and
      fidelity. Except in their presence, the monastic slave might not
      receive the visits of his friends or kindred; and it was deemed
      highly meritorious, if he afflicted a tender sister, or an aged
      parent, by the obstinate refusal of a word or look. 58 The monks
      themselves passed their lives, without personal attachments,
      among a crowd which had been formed by accident, and was
      detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice. Recluse
      fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special
      license of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their
      familiar visits; and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped
      in their cowls, inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each
      other. 59 Study is the resource of solitude: but education had
      not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics
      and peasants who filled the monastic communities. They might
      work: but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to
      disdain the exercise of manual labor; and the industry must be
      faint and languid, which is not excited by the sense of personal
      interest.

      intolerable laws of silence and mortification.]

      According to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day,
      which they passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental
      prayer: they assembled in the evening, and they were awakened in
      the night, for the public worship of the monastery. The precise
      moment was determined by the stars, which are seldom clouded in
      the serene sky of Egypt; and a rustic horn, or trumpet, the
      signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast silence of the
      desert. 60 Even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy, was
      rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled
      along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of
      each day, he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the
      sun. 61 In this comfortless state, superstition still pursued and
      tormented her wretched votaries. 62 The repose which they had
      sought in the cloister was disturbed by a tardy repentance,
      profane doubts, and guilty desires; and, while they considered
      each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin, they perpetually
      trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss. From the
      painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims
      were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth
      century, a hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion
      of the austere penitents, who were deprived of their senses. 63
      Their visions, before they attained this extreme and acknowledged
      term of frenzy, have afforded ample materials of supernatural
      history. It was their firm persuasion, that the air, which they
      breathed, was peopled with invisible enemies; with innumerable
      demons, who watched every occasion, and assumed every form, to
      terrify, and above all to tempt, their unguarded virtue. The
      imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by the illusions
      of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight prayer
      was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the
      phantoms of horror or delight, which had occupied his sleeping
      and his waking dreams. 64

      The monks were divided into two classes: the Coenobites, who
      lived under a common and regular discipline; and the Anachorets,
      who indulged their unsocial, independent fanaticism. 65 The most
      devout, or the most ambitious, of the spiritual brethren,
      renounced the convent, as they had renounced the world. The
      fervent monasteries of Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, were
      surrounded by a Laura, 66 a distant circle of solitary cells; and
      the extravagant penance of Hermits was stimulated by applause and
      emulation. 67 They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and
      chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars,
      bracelets, gauntlets, and greaves of massy and rigid iron. All
      superfluous encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away;
      and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired, whose
      naked bodies were only covered by their long hair. They aspired
      to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the
      human brute is scarcely distinguishable above his kindred
      animals; and the numerous sect of Anachorets derived their name
      from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of
      Mesopotamia with the common herd. 68 They often usurped the den
      of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried
      themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped
      out of the rock; and the marble quarries of Thebais are still
      inscribed with the monuments of their penance. 69 The most
      perfect Hermits are supposed to have passed many days without
      food, many nights without sleep, and many years without speaking;
      and glorious was the man ( I abuse that name) who contrived any
      cell, or seat, of a peculiar construction, which might expose
      him, in the most inconvenient posture, to the inclemency of the
      seasons.

      Among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of
      Simeon Stylites 70 have been immortalized by the singular
      invention of an aerial penance. At the age of thirteen, the young
      Syrian deserted the profession of a shepherd, and threw himself
      into an austere monastery. After a long and painful novitiate, in
      which Simeon was repeatedly saved from pious suicide, he
      established his residence on a mountain, about thirty or forty
      miles to the east of Antioch. Within the space of a mandra, or
      circle of stones, to which he had attached himself by a ponderous
      chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised from
      the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground. 71 In
      this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the
      heat of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit
      and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation
      without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the
      different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect
      attitude, with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross,
      but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre
      skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator,
      after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at
      length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an
      ulcer in his thigh 72 might shorten, but it could not disturb,
      this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without
      descending from his column. A prince, who should capriciously
      inflict such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would
      surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable
      existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty. This voluntary
      martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of
      the mind and body; nor can it be presumed that the fanatics, who
      torment themselves, are susceptible of any lively affection for
      the rest of mankind. A cruel, unfeeling temper has distinguished
      the monks of every age and country: their stern indifference,
      which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is inflamed by
      religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously
      administered the holy office of the Inquisition.

      Elijah, into a fiery chariot. The saint too hastily raised his
      foot, and Satan seized the moment of inflicting this chastisement
      on his vanity.]

      The monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a
      philosopher, were respected, and almost adored, by the prince and
      people. Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted
      the divine pillar of Simeon: the tribes of Saracens disputed in
      arms the honor of his benediction; the queens of Arabia and
      Persia gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue; and the
      angelic Hermit was consulted by the younger Theodosius, in the
      most important concerns of the church and state. His remains were
      transported from the mountain of Telenissa, by a solemn
      procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the East, six
      bishops, twenty-one counts or tribunes, and six thousand
      soldiers; and Antioch revered his bones, as her glorious ornament
      and impregnable defence. The fame of the apostles and martyrs was
      gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets; the
      Christian world fell prostrate before their shrines; and the
      miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded, at least in number
      and duration, the spiritual exploits of their lives. But the
      golden legend of their lives 73 was embellished by the artful
      credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing age was
      easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or a
      Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of
      the universe. The favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure
      inveterate diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message;
      and to expel the most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies
      which they possessed. They familiarly accosted, or imperiously
      commanded, the lions and serpents of the desert; infused
      vegetation into a sapless trunk; suspended iron on the surface of
      the water; passed the Nile on the back of a crocodile, and
      refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace. These extravagant tales,
      which display the fiction without the genius, of poetry, have
      seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals, of the
      Christians. Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of
      the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and
      superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of
      philosophy and science. Every mode of religious worship which had
      been practised by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which
      they believed, was fortified by the sanction of divine
      revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the
      servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible
      to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of
      Cicero and the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the character
      of Cato and that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable
      revolution which was accomplished in the Roman empire within a
      period of five hundred years.

      II. The progress of Christianity has been marked by two glorious
      and decisive victories: over the learned and luxurious citizens
      of the Roman empire; and over the warlike Barbarians of Scythia
      and Germany, who subverted the empire, and embraced the religion,
      of the Romans. The Goths were the foremost of these savage
      proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a
      countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among
      the inventors of useful arts, who have deserved the remembrance
      and gratitude of posterity. A great number of Roman provincials
      had been led away into captivity by the Gothic bands, who ravaged
      Asia in the time of Gallienus; and of these captives, many were
      Christians, and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order.
      Those involuntary missionaries, dispersed as slaves in the
      villages of Dacia, successively labored for the salvation of
      their masters. The seeds which they planted, of the evangelic
      doctrine, were gradually propagated; and before the end of a
      century, the pious work was achieved by the labors of Ulphilas,
      whose ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a
      small town of Cappadocia.

      Ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the Goths, 74 acquired their
      love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal;
      and they received, with implicit confidence, the doctrines of
      truth and virtue which he preached and practised. He executed the
      arduous task of translating the Scriptures into their native
      tongue, a dialect of the German or Teutonic language; but he
      prudently suppressed the four books of Kings, as they might tend
      to irritate the fierce and sanguinary spirit of the Barbarians.
      The rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds, so ill
      qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was improved and
      modulated by his genius: and Ulphilas, before he could frame his
      version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four
      letters; 741 four of which he invented, to express the peculiar
      sounds that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation. 75
      But the prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted
      by war and intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by
      religion as well as by interest. Fritigern, the friend of the
      Romans, became the proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul
      of Athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire and of the gospel.
      The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which
      he excited. A wagon, bearing aloft the shapeless image of Thor,
      perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn procession through
      the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused to worship
      the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
      tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recommended him to
      the esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the
      minister of peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths,
      who implored the protection of Valens; and the name of Moses was
      applied to this spiritual guide, who conducted his people through
      the deep waters of the Danube to the Land of Promise. 76 The
      devout shepherds, who were attached to his person, and tractable
      to his voice, acquiesced in their settlement, at the foot of the
      Maesian mountains, in a country of woodlands and pastures, which
      supported their flocks and herds, and enabled them to purchase
      the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces. These harmless
      Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of
      Christianity. 77

      Their fiercer brethren, the formidable Visigoths, universally
      adopted the religion of the Romans, with whom they maintained a
      perpetual intercourse, of war, of friendship, or of conquest. In
      their long and victorious march from the Danube to the Atlantic
      Ocean, they converted their allies; they educated the rising
      generation; and the devotion which reigned in the camp of Alaric,
      or the court of Thoulouse, might edify or disgrace the palaces of
      Rome and Constantinople. 78 During the same period, Christianity
      was embraced by almost all the Barbarians, who established their
      kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire; the Burgundians in
      Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the Ostrogoths
      in Pannonia, and the various bands of mercenaries, that raised
      Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons still
      persevered in the errors of Paganism; but the Franks obtained the
      monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis;
      and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their
      savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome. These Barbarian

      Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part III.

      The different motives which influenced the reason, or the
      passions, of the Barbarian converts, cannot easily be
      ascertained. They were often capricious and accidental; a dream,
      an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest, or
      hero, the charms of a believing wife, and, above all, the
      fortunate event of a prayer, or vow, which, in a moment of
      danger, they had addressed to the God of the Christians. 80 The
      early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the
      habits of frequent and familiar society, the moral precepts of
      the gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the
      monks; and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible
      power of relics, and the pomp of religious worship. But the
      rational and ingenious mode of persuasion, which a Saxon bishop
      81 suggested to a popular saint, might sometimes be employed by
      the missionaries, who labored for the conversion of infidels.
      “Admit,” says the sagacious disputant, “whatever they are pleased
      to assert of the fabulous, and carnal, genealogy of their gods
      and goddesses, who are propagated from each other. From this
      principle deduce their imperfect nature, and human infirmities,
      the assurance they were born, and the probability that they will
      die. At what time, by what means, from what cause, were the
      eldest of the gods or goddesses produced? Do they still continue,
      or have they ceased, to propagate? If they have ceased, summon
      your antagonists to declare the reason of this strange
      alteration. If they still continue, the number of the gods must
      become infinite; and shall we not risk, by the indiscreet worship
      of some impotent deity, to excite the resentment of his jealous
      superior? The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the
      universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or
      eternal? If created, how, or where, could the gods themselves
      exist before creation? If eternal, how could they assume the
      empire of an independent and preexisting world? Urge these
      arguments with temper and moderation; insinuate, at seasonable
      intervals, the truth and beauty of the Christian revelation; and
      endeavor to make the unbelievers ashamed, without making them
      angry.” This metaphysical reasoning, too refined, perhaps, for
      the Barbarians of Germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of
      authority and popular consent. The advantage of temporal
      prosperity had deserted the Pagan cause, and passed over to the
      service of Christianity. The Romans themselves, the most powerful
      and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient
      superstition; and, if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse
      the efficacy of the new faith, the disgrace was already retrieved
      by the conversion of the victorious Goths. The valiant and
      fortunate Barbarians, who subdued the provinces of the West,
      successively received, and reflected, the same edifying example.
      Before the age of Charlemagne, the Christian nations of Europe
      might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate
      climates, of the fertile lands, which produced corn, wine, and
      oil; while the savage idolaters, and their helpless idols, were
      confined to the extremities of the earth, the dark and frozen
      regions of the North. 82

      Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven to the Barbarians,
      introduced an important change in their moral and political
      condition. They received, at the same time, the use of letters,
      so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a
      sacred book; and while they studied the divine truth, their minds
      were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of
      nature, of the arts, and of society. The version of the
      Scriptures into their native tongue, which had facilitated their
      conversion, must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read
      the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the
      church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain
      of ecclesiastical tradition. These spiritual gifts were preserved
      in the Greek and Latin languages, which concealed the inestimable
      monuments of ancient learning. The immortal productions of
      Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were accessible to the Christian
      Barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of
      Augustus and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne. The emulation
      of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect
      state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm
      and enlighten the mature age of the Western world.

      In the most corrupt state of Christianity, the Barbarians might
      learn justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the
      knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions,
      or to regulate their passions, they were sometimes restrained by
      conscience, and frequently punished by remorse. But the direct
      authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion,
      which united them with their Christian brethren in spiritual
      friendship. The influence of these sentiments contributed to
      secure their fidelity in the service, or the alliance, of the
      Romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate the
      insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the
      empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of
      Rome. In the days of Paganism, the priests of Gaul and Germany
      reigned over the people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the
      magistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or
      more ample, measure of devout obedience, to the pontiffs of the
      Christian faith. The sacred character of the bishops was
      supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an
      honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and
      freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to
      mollify, by peaceful counsels, the fierce spirit of the
      Barbarians. The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy, the
      frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing
      authority of the popes, cemented the union of the Christian
      republic, and gradually produced the similar manners, and common
      jurisprudence, which have distinguished, from the rest of
      mankind, the independent, and even hostile, nations of modern
      Europe.

      But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the
      unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup
      of Salvation. Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas,
      his connections with the empire and the church were formed during
      the reign of Arianism. The apostle of the Goths subscribed the
      creed of Rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with
      sincerity, that the Son was not equal, or consubstantial to the
      Father; 83 communicated these errors to the clergy and people;
      and infected the Barbaric world with a heresy, 84 which the great
      Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the Romans. The
      temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted
      to metaphysical subtilties; but they strenuously maintained, what
      they had piously received, as the pure and genuine doctrines of
      Christianity. The advantage of preaching and expounding the
      Scriptures in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors
      of Ulphilas and his successors; and they ordained a competent
      number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the
      kindred tribes. The Ostrogoths, the Burgundians, the Suevi, and
      the Vandals, who had listened to the eloquence of the Latin
      clergy, 85 preferred the more intelligible lessons of their
      domestic teachers; and Arianism was adopted as the national faith
      of the warlike converts, who were seated on the ruins of the
      Western empire. This irreconcilable difference of religion was a
      perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of
      Barbarian was imbittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic.
      The heroes of the North, who had submitted, with some reluctance,
      to believe that all their ancestors were in hell, 86 were
      astonished and exasperated to learn, that they themselves had
      only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation. Instead of
      the smooth applause, which Christian kings are accustomed to
      expect from their royal prelates, the orthodox bishops and their
      clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts; and
      their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might
      sometimes be dangerous. 87 The pulpit, that safe and sacred organ
      of sedition, resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes;
      88 the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a
      glorious deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to
      promote the accomplishment of their own predictions.
      Notwithstanding these provocations, the Catholics of Gaul, Spain,
      and Italy, enjoyed, under the reign of the Arians, the free and
      peaceful exercise of their religion. Their haughty masters
      respected the zeal of a numerous people, resolved to die at the
      foot of their altars; and the example of their devout constancy
      was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves. The
      conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or
      confession, of fear, by attributing their toleration to the
      liberal motives of reason and humanity; and while they affected
      the language, they imperceptiby imbibed the spirit, of genuine
      Christianity.

      The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted. The Catholics
      were indiscreet, the Barbarians were impatient; and the partial
      acts of severity or injustice, which had been recommended by the
      Arian clergy, were exaggerated by the orthodox writers. The guilt
      of persecution may be imputed to Euric, king of the Visigoths;
      who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical, or, at least, of
      episcopal functions; and punished the popular bishops of Aquitain
      with imprisonment, exile, and confiscation. 89 But the cruel and
      absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was
      undertaken by the Vandals alone. Genseric himself, in his early
      youth, had renounced the orthodox communion; and the apostate
      could neither grant, nor expect, a sincere forgiveness. He was
      exasperated to find that the Africans, who had fled before him in
      the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and
      churches; and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of
      compassion. His Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant
      laws and arbitrary punishments. The language of Genseric was
      furious and formidable; the knowledge of his intentions might
      justify the most unfavorable interpretation of his actions; and
      the Arians were reproached with the frequent executions which
      stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant. Arms and
      ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the monarch of the
      sea. But Hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed to inherit only
      his vices, tormented the Catholics with the same unrelenting fury
      which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews, and the friends
      and favorites of his father; and even to the Arian patriarch, who
      was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage. The religious
      war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution
      was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court;
      and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of Hunneric,
      revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance,
      of the church. The throne of Africa was successively filled by
      the two nephews of Hunneric; by Gundamund, who reigned about
      twelve, and by Thrasimund, who governed the nation about
      twenty-seven, years. Their administration was hostile and
      oppressive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to emulate,
      or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length
      he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom
      of Athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits
      of his tardy clemency. His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest
      and most accomplished of the Vandal kings, whom he excelled in
      beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. But this magnanimous
      character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful
      clemency. Instead of threats and tortures, he employed the
      gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction. Wealth, dignity,
      and the royal favor, were the liberal rewards of apostasy; the
      Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon
      by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever Thrasimund
      meditated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till the
      indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious
      opportunity. Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death;
      and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would
      never tolerate the sectaries of Athanasius. But his successor,
      Hilderic, the gentle son of the savage Hunneric, preferred the
      duties of humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an
      impious oath; and his accession was gloriously marked by the
      restoration of peace and universal freedom. The throne of that
      virtuous, though feeble monarch, was usurped by his cousin
      Gelimer, a zealous Arian: but the Vandal kingdom, before he could
      enjoy or abuse his power, was subverted by the arms of
      Belisarius; and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which
      they had endured. 90

      impartial Procopius, (c. 7, 8, p. 196, 197, 198, 199.) Dom
      Ruinart, the last editor of Victor, has illustrated the whole
      subject with a copious and learned apparatus of notes and
      supplement (Paris, 1694.)]

      The passionate declamations of the Catholics, the sole historians
      of this persecution, cannot afford any distinct series of causes
      and events; any impartial view of the characters, or counsels;
      but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit
      or notice, may be referred to the following heads; I. In the
      original law, which is still extant, 91 Hunneric expressly
      declares, (and the declaration appears to be correct,) that he
      had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the
      Imperial edicts, against the heretical congregations, the clergy,
      and the people, who dissented from the established religion. If
      the rights of conscience had been understood, the Catholics must
      have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual
      suffering. But they still persisted to refuse the indulgence
      which they claimed. While they trembled under the lash of
      persecution, they praised the laudable severity of Hunneric
      himself, who burnt or banished great numbers of Manichæans; 92
      and they rejected, with horror, the ignominious compromise, that
      the disciples of Arius and of Athanasius should enjoy a
      reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the
      Romans, and in those of the Vandals. 93 II. The practice of a
      conference, which the Catholics had so frequently used to insult
      and punish their obstinate antagonists, was retorted against
      themselves. 94 At the command of Hunneric, four hundred and
      sixty-six orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage; but when they
      were admitted into the hall of audience, they had the
      mortification of beholding the Arian Cyrila exalted on the
      patriarchal throne. The disputants were separated, after the
      mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and
      precipitation, of military force and of popular clamor. One
      martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic
      bishops; twenty-eight escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by
      conformity; forty-six were sent into Corsica to cut timber for
      the royal navy; and three hundred and two were banished to the
      different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults of their
      enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual
      comforts of life. 95 The hardships of ten years’ exile must have
      reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of
      Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the
      orthodox church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its
      actual members. They disobeyed, and their disobedience was
      punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into
      Sardinia; where they languished fifteen years, till the accession
      of the gracious Hilderic. 96 The two islands were judiciously
      chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants. Seneca, from his own
      experience, has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of
      Corsica, 97 and the plenty of Sardinia was overbalanced by the
      unwholesome quality of the air. 98 III. The zeal of Genseric and
      his successors, for the conversion of the Catholics, must have
      rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the
      Vandal faith. Before the churches were finally shut, it was a
      crime to appear in a Barbarian dress; and those who presumed to
      neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their
      long hair. 99 The palatine officers, who refused to profess the
      religion of their prince, were ignominiously stripped of their
      honors and employments; banished to Sardinia and Sicily; or
      condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the
      fields of Utica. In the districts which had been peculiarly
      allotted to the Vandals, the exercise of the Catholic worship was
      more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced
      against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte. By
      these arts, the faith of the Barbarians was preserved, and their
      zeal was inflamed: they discharged, with devout fury, the office
      of spies, informers, or executioners; and whenever their cavalry
      took the field, it was the favorite amusement of the march to
      defile the churches, and to insult the clergy of the adverse
      faction. 100 IV. The citizens who had been educated in the luxury
      of the Roman province, were delivered, with exquisite cruelty, to
      the Moors of the desert. A venerable train of bishops,
      presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of four thousand
      and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained,
      were torn from their native homes, by the command of Hunneric.
      During the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle,
      amidst their own ordure: during the day they pursued their march
      over the burning sands; and if they fainted under the heat and
      fatigue, they were goaded, or dragged along, till they expired in
      the hands of their tormentors. 101 These unhappy exiles, when
      they reached the Moorish huts, might excite the compassion of a
      people, whose native humanity was neither improved by reason, nor
      corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers, they
      were condemned to share the distress of a savage life. V. It is
      incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect,
      whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme.
      They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it
      soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the
      crime, of the offender. The fine, which he is unable or unwilling
      to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and
      his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety
      of capital punishment. Through the veil of fiction and
      declamation we may clearly perceive, that the Catholics more
      especially under the reign of Hunneric, endured the most cruel
      and ignominious treatment. 102 Respectable citizens, noble
      matrons, and consecrated virgins, were stripped naked, and raised
      in the air by pulleys, with a weight suspended at their feet. In
      this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges,
      or burnt in the most tender parts with red-hot plates of iron.
      The amputation of the ears the nose, the tongue, and the right
      hand, was inflicted by the Arians; and although the precise
      number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among
      whom a bishop 103 and a proconsul 104 may be named, were entitled
      to the crown of martyrdom. The same honor has been ascribed to
      the memory of Count Sebastian, who professed the Nicene creed
      with unshaken constancy; and Genseric might detest, as a heretic,
      the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival. 105
      VI. A new mode of conversion, which might subdue the feeble, and
      alarm the timorous, was employed by the Arian ministers. They
      imposed, by fraud or violence, the rites of baptism; and punished
      the apostasy of the Catholics, if they disclaimed this odious and
      profane ceremony, which scandalously violated the freedom of the
      will, and the unity of the sacrament. 106 The hostile sects had
      formerly allowed the validity of each other’s baptism; and the
      innovation, so fiercely maintained by the Vandals, can be imputed
      only to the example and advice of the Donatists. VII. The Arian
      clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals;
      but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard,
      which they were so desirous to possess. A patriarch 107 might
      seat himself on the throne of Carthage; some bishops, in the
      principal cities, might usurp the place of their rivals; but the
      smallness of their numbers, and their ignorance of the Latin
      language, 108 disqualified the Barbarians for the ecclesiastical
      ministry of a great church; and the Africans, after the loss of
      their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise of
      Christianity. VIII. The emperors were the natural protectors of
      the Homoousian doctrine; and the faithful people of Africa, both
      as Romans and as Catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to
      the usurpation of the Barbarous heretics. During an interval of
      peace and friendship, Hunneric restored the cathedral of
      Carthage; at the intercession of Zeno, who reigned in the East,
      and of Placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors, and the
      sister of the queen of the Vandals. 109 But this decent regard
      was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed his
      contempt for the religion of the empire, by studiously arranging
      the bloody images of persecution, in all the principal streets
      through which the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the
      palace. 110 An oath was required from the bishops, who were
      assembled at Carthage, that they would support the succession of
      his son Hilderic, and that they would renounce all foreign or
      transmarine correspondence. This engagement, consistent, as it
      should seem, with their moral and religious duties, was refused
      by the more sagacious members 111 of the assembly. Their refusal,
      faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a
      Christian to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous
      tyrant.

      Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part IV.

      The Catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far
      superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning. With the
      same weapons which the Greek 112 and Latin fathers had already
      provided for the Arian controversy, they repeatedly silenced, or
      vanquished, the fierce and illiterate successors of Ulphilas. The
      consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them
      above the arts and passions of religious warfare. Yet, instead of
      assuming such honorable pride, the orthodox theologians were
      tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to compose fictions, which
      must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery. They
      ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of
      Christian antiquity; the characters of Athanasius and Augustin
      were awkwardly personated by Vigilius and his disciples; 113 and
      the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the
      Trinity and the Incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability,
      from this African school. 114 Even the Scriptures themselves were
      profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable
      text, which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in
      heaven, 115 is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox
      fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts. 116 It was
      first alleged by the Catholic bishops whom Hunneric summoned to
      the conference of Carthage. 117 An allegorical interpretation, in
      the form, perhaps, of a marginal note, invaded the text of the
      Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected in a dark period
      of ten centuries. 118 After the invention of printing, 119 the
      editors of the Greek Testament yielded to their own prejudices,
      or those of the times; 120 and the pious fraud, which was
      embraced with equal zeal at Rome and at Geneva, has been
      infinitely multiplied in every country and every language of
      modern Europe.

      the historian, who views this religious conflict with an
      impartial eye, may condescend to mention one preternatural event,
      which will edify the devout, and surprise the incredulous.
      Tipasa, 121 a maritime colony of Mauritania, sixteen miles to the
      east of Caesarea, had been distinguished, in every age, by the
      orthodox zeal of its inhabitants. They had braved the fury of the
      Donatists; 122 they resisted, or eluded, the tyranny of the
      Arians. The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical
      bishop: most of the inhabitants who could procure ships passed
      over to the coast of Spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all
      communion with the usurper, still presumed to hold their pious,
      but illegal, assemblies. Their disobedience exasperated the
      cruelty of Hunneric. A military count was despatched from
      Carthage to Tipasa: he collected the Catholics in the Forum, and,
      in the presence of the whole province, deprived the guilty of
      their right hands and their tongues. But the holy confessors
      continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested
      by Victor, an African bishop, who published a history of the
      persecution within two years after the event. 123 “If any one,”
      says Victor, “should doubt of the truth, let him repair to
      Constantinople, and listen to the clear and perfect language of
      Restitutus, the sub-deacon, one of these glorious sufferers, who
      is now lodged in the palace of the emperor Zeno, and is respected
      by the devout empress.” At Constantinople we are astonished to
      find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness, without
      interest, and without passion. Aeneas of Gaza, a Platonic
      philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on
      these African sufferers. “I saw them myself: I heard them speak:
      I diligently inquired by what means such an articulate voice
      could be formed without any organ of speech: I used my eyes to
      examine the report of my ears; I opened their mouth, and saw that
      the whole tongue had been completely torn away by the roots; an
      operation which the physicians generally suppose to be mortal.”
      124 The testimony of Aeneas of Gaza might be confirmed by the
      superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian, in a perpetual
      edict; of Count Marcellinus, in his Chronicle of the times; and
      of Pope Gregory the First, who had resided at Constantinople, as
      the minister of the Roman pontiff. 125 They all lived within the
      compass of a century; and they all appeal to their personal
      knowledge, or the public notoriety, for the truth of a miracle,
      which was repeated in several instances, displayed on the
      greatest theatre of the world, and submitted, during a series of
      years, to the calm examination of the senses. This supernatural
      gift of the African confessors, who spoke without tongues, will
      command the assent of those, and of those only, who already
      believe, that their language was pure and orthodox. But the
      stubborn mind of an infidel, is guarded by secret, incurable
      suspicion; and the Arian, or Socinian, who has seriously rejected
      the doctrine of a Trinity, will not be shaken by the most
      plausible evidence of an Athanasian miracle.

      The Vandals and the Ostrogoths persevered in the profession of
      Arianism till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had
      founded in Africa and Italy. The Barbarians of Gaul submitted to
      the orthodox dominion of the Franks; and Spain was restored to
      the Catholic church by the voluntary conversion of the Visigoths.

      This salutary revolution 126 was hastened by the example of a
      royal martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful
      rebel. Leovigild, the Gothic monarch of Spain, deserved the
      respect of his enemies, and the love of his subjects; the
      Catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and his Arian synods
      attempted, without much success, to reconcile their scruples by
      abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism. His eldest son
      Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal
      diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica, contracted an
      honorable and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian princess, the
      daughter of Sigebert, king of Austrasia, and of the famous
      Brunechild. The beauteous Ingundis, who was no more than thirteen
      years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted, in the Arian
      court of Toledo; and her religious constancy was alternately
      assaulted with blandishments and violence by Goisvintha, the
      Gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority.
      127 Incensed by her resistance, Goisvintha seized the Catholic
      princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the
      ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last
      gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin,
      or fish-pond. 128 Love and honor might excite Hermenegild to
      resent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was
      gradually persuaded that Ingundis suffered for the cause of
      divine truth. Her tender complaints, and the weighty arguments of
      Leander, archbishop of Seville, accomplished his conversion and
      the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith
      by the solemn rites of confirmation. 129 The rash youth, inflamed
      by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the
      duties of a son and a subject; and the Catholics of Spain,
      although they could not complain of persecution, applauded his
      pious rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was
      protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova,
      and Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of
      Hermenegild. He invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Seuvi, and
      the Franks, to the destruction of his native land; he solicited
      the dangerous aid of the Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part
      of the Spanish coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop
      Leander, effectually negotiated in person with the Byzantine
      court. But the hopes of the Catholics were crushed by the active
      diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops and treasures
      of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain attempts to
      resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into the
      hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that
      sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal
      ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the
      Catholic religion. His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at
      length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king; and the
      sentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance,
      was privately executed in the tower of Seville. The inflexible
      constancy with which he refused to accept the Arian communion, as
      the price of his safety, may excuse the honors that have been
      paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant son
      were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity; and this
      domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild, and
      imbittered the last moments of his life.

      were the issue of a former marriage.]

      His son and successor, Recared, the first Catholic king of Spain,
      had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother, which he
      supported with more prudence and success. Instead of revolting
      against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his
      death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed,
      that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and
      recommended to his son the conversion of the Gothic nation. To
      accomplish that salutary end, Recared convened an assembly of the
      Arian clergy and nobles, declared himself a Catholic, and
      exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince. The
      laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious
      pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless
      controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his
      illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments,—the
      testimony of Earth, and of Heaven. The Earth had submitted to the
      Nicene synod: the Romans, the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of
      Spain, unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the
      Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the consent of the Christian
      world. A superstitious age was prepared to reverence, as the
      testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures, which were
      performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy; the
      baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica, 130 which were spontaneously
      replenished every year, on the vigil of Easter; 131 and the
      miraculous shrine of St. Martin of Tours, which had already
      converted the Suevic prince and people of Gallicia. 132 The
      Catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important
      change of the national religion. A conspiracy, secretly fomented
      by the queen-dowager, was formed against his life; and two counts
      excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul. But Recared
      disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed
      severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with
      the reproach of persecution. Eight bishops, whose names betray
      their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of
      Arian theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which
      they had been purposely collected. The whole body of the
      Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the
      Catholic communion; the faith, at least of the rising generation,
      was fervent and sincere: and the devout liberality of the
      Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain.
      Seventy bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the
      submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards
      improved the Nicene creed, by declaring the procession of the
      Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty
      point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the schism of
      the Greek and Latin churches. 133 The royal proselyte immediately
      saluted and consulted Pope Gregory, surnamed the Great, a learned
      and holy prelate, whose reign was distinguished by the conversion
      of heretics and infidels. The ambassadors of Recared respectfully
      offered on the threshold of the Vatican his rich presents of gold
      and gems; they accepted, as a lucrative exchange, the hairs of
      St. John the Baptist; a cross, which enclosed a small piece of
      the true wood; and a key, that contained some particles of iron
      which had been scraped from the chains of St. Peter. 134

      Christianity was polluted by the Arian heresy. Her devout labors
      still left room for the industry and success of future
      missionaries; and many cities of Italy were still disputed by
      hostile bishops. But the cause of Arianism was gradually
      suppressed by the weight of truth, of interest, and of example;
      and the controversy, which Egypt had derived from the Platonic
      school, was terminated, after a war of three hundred years, by
      the final conversion of the Lombards of Italy. 135

      attempt to mark the precise era of the national conversion, which
      was accomplished, however, before the end of the seventh
      century.]

      The first missionaries who preached the gospel to the Barbarians,
      appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of
      toleration. 136 But no sooner had they established their
      spiritual dominion, than they exhorted the Christian kings to
      extirpate, without mercy, the remains of Roman or Barbaric
      superstition. The successors of Clovis inflicted one hundred
      lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols; the
      crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished by the
      Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and
      confiscation; and even the wise Alfred adopted, as an
      indispensable duty, the extreme rigor of the Mosaic institutions.
      137 But the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished
      among a Christian people; the theological disputes of the schools
      were suspended by propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit
      which could find neither idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to
      the persecution of the Jews. That exiled nation had founded some
      synagogues in the cities of Gaul; but Spain, since the time of
      Hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies. 138 The wealth
      which they accumulated by trade, and the management of the
      finances, invited the pious avarice of their masters; and they
      might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use, and
      even the remembrance, of arms. Sisebut, a Gothic king, who
      reigned in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at
      once to the last extremes of persecution. 139 Ninety thousand
      Jews were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism; the
      fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated, their bodies
      were tortured; and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted
      to abandon their native country. The excessive zeal of the
      Catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy of Spain, who
      solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the sacraments
      should not be forcibly imposed; but that the Jews who had been
      baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to
      persevere in the external practice of a religion which they
      disbelieved and detested. Their frequent relapses provoked one of
      the successors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his
      dominions; and a council of Toledo published a decree, that every
      Gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict. But the
      tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims, whom they
      delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious
      slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression. The
      Jews still continued in Spain, under the weight of the civil and
      ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been
      faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition. The Gothic
      kings and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will
      produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of
      revenge. A nation, the secret or professed enemies of
      Christianity, still multiplied in servitude and distress; and the
      intrigues of the Jews promoted the rapid success of the Arabian
      conquerors. 140

      As soon as the Barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the
      unpopular heresy of Arius sunk into contempt and oblivion. But
      the Greeks still retained their subtle and loquacious
      disposition: the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested
      new questions, and new disputes; and it was always in the power
      of an ambitious prelate, or a fanatic monk, to violate the peace
      of the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The historian of the
      empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the
      obscurity of schools and synods. The Manichæans, who labored to
      reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster, had secretly
      introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign
      sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics,
      and the Imperial laws were executed by the public hatred. The
      rational opinions of the Pelagians were propagated from Britain
      to Rome, Africa, and Palestine, and silently expired in a
      superstitious age. But the East was distracted by the Nestorian
      and Eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain the
      mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of Christianity
      in her native land. These controversies were first agitated under
      the reign of the younger Theodosius: but their important
      consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume.
      The metaphysical chain of argument, the contests of
      ecclesiastical ambition, and their political influence on the
      decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an interesting and
      instructive series of history, from the general councils of
      Ephesus and Chalcedon, to the conquest of the East by the
      successors of Mahomet.

      The Gauls, 1 who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a
      memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose
      weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of
      Tacitus. 2 “The protection of the republic has delivered Gaul
      from internal discord and foreign invasions. By the loss of
      national independence, you have acquired the name and privileges
      of Roman citizens. You enjoy, in common with yourselves, the
      permanent benefits of civil government; and your remote situation
      is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny. Instead
      of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to
      impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation.
      Peace cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be
      supported at the expense of the people. It is for your sake, not
      for our own, that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the
      ferocious Germans, who have so often attempted, and who will
      always desire, to exchange the solitude of their woods and
      morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul. The fall of Rome
      would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in the
      ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor
      and wisdom of eight hundred years. Your imaginary freedom would
      be insulted and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion
      of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of
      the Barbarian conquerors.” 3 This salutary advice was accepted,
      and this strange prediction was accomplished. In the space of
      four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms
      of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of
      citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved; and the
      Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the
      possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of
      its peaceful and polished inhabitants. With that conscious pride
      which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to
      inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the
      North; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite,
      and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and
      to the smell. The liberal studies were still cultivated in the
      schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the language of Cicero and
      Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their ears were
      astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic
      dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses
      fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were
      endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they
      wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to
      obey, and even to flatter, the victorious Barbarians, by whose
      clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives. 4

      As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought
      the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The new
      sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all
      the Roman conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the
      Ocean: 5 and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some
      ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue and
      dominion. The lawful pretensions of Euric were justified by
      ambition and success; and the Gothic nation might aspire, under
      his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul. Arles and
      Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of
      Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from
      exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited
      before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and
      suppliants; and their various business at the court of Bordeaux
      attested the power, and the renown, of the king of the Visigoths.
      The Heruli of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies
      with its coerulean color, implored his protection; and the Saxons
      respected the maritime provinces of a prince, who was destitute
      of any naval force. The tall Burgundians submitted to his
      authority; nor did he restore the captive Franks, till he had
      imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The
      Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the
      Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against
      the oppression of the neighboring Huns. The North (such are the
      lofty strains of the poet) was agitated or appeased by the nod of
      Euric; the great king of Persia consulted the oracle of the West;
      and the aged god of the Tyber was protected by the swelling
      genius of the Garonne. 6 The fortune of nations has often
      depended on accidents; and France may ascribe her greatness to
      the premature death of the Gothic king, at a time when his son
      Alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary Clovis 7 an
      ambitious and valiant youth.

      German aspiration, and the true name is not different from Lewis,
      (Mem. de ‘Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 68.)]

      While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany,
      he was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the
      king, of the Thuringians. After his restoration, Basina escaped
      from her husband’s bed to the arms of her lover; freely
      declaring, that if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more
      beautiful, than Childeric, that man should have been the object
      of her preference. 8 9 Clovis was the offspring of this voluntary
      union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of age, he
      succeeded, by his father’s death, to the command of the Salian
      tribe. The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the
      island of the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and
      Arras; 10 and at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors
      could not exceed five thousand. The kindred tribes of the Franks,
      who had seated themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld,
      the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, were governed by their
      independent kings, of the Merovingian race; the equals, the
      allies, and sometimes the enemies of the Salic prince. But the
      Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary jurisdiction of
      their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and
      victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis attracted
      the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. When he
      first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his
      coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazine; 11 but he imitated
      the example of Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired
      wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of
      conquest. After each successful battle or expedition, the spoils
      were accumulated in one common mass; every warrior received his
      proportionable share; and the royal prerogative submitted to the
      equal regulations of military law. The untamed spirit of the
      Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular
      discipline. 12 At the annual review of the month of March, their
      arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed a
      peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade of
      grass. The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or
      disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. It would
      be superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of
      Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence. 13 In all
      his transactions with mankind, he calculated the weight of
      interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were
      sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans, and
      sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome, and
      Christianity. He was intercepted in the career of victory, since
      he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already
      accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of
      the French monarchy in Gaul.

      managed weighty and delicate negotiations, ingeniously
      illustrates (Mem. de l’Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p.
      147-184) the political system of Clovis.]

      The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son
      of Aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be
      inflamed by private resentment. The glory of the father still
      insulted the Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite
      the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks. Syagrius
      inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of
      Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second Belgic, Rheims and
      Troyes, Beauvais and Amiens, would naturally submit to the count
      or patrician: 14 and after the dissolution of the Western empire,
      he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of
      king of the Romans. 15 As a Roman, he had been educated in the
      liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged
      by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom.
      The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a
      stranger, who possessed the singular talent of explaining, in
      their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity. The
      diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the
      impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary
      obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and
      Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil
      society. 16 In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius
      received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis;
      who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the
      language, of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field 17 of
      battle. In the time of Caesar Soissons would have poured forth a
      body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been
      plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military
      engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city. 18
      But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since
      exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who
      marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of
      contending with the national valor of the Franks. It would be
      ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength
      and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who
      escaped, after the loss of a battle, to the distant court of
      Thoulouse. The feeble minority of Alaric could not assist or
      protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous 19 Goths were
      intimidated by the menaces of Clovis; and the Roman king, after a
      short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the
      executioner. The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the
      Franks; and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the
      ample diocese of Tongres 20 which Clovis subdued in the tenth
      year of his reign.

      The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their
      imaginary settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake. 21 That
      fortunate district, from the lake to the Avenche, and Mount Jura,
      was occupied by the Burgundians. 22 The northern parts of
      Helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni, who
      destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest. A
      province, improved and adorned by the arts of Rome, was again
      reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the stately
      Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous
      valley of the Aar. 23 From the source of the Rhine to its conflux
      with the Mein and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the
      Alemanni commanded either side of the river, by the right of
      ancient possession, or recent victory. They had spread themselves
      into Gaul, over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; and
      their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned the Salic
      prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies.

      Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac,
      about twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fiercest
      nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of past
      exploits, and the prospect of future greatness. The Franks, after
      an obstinate struggle, gave way; and the Alemanni, raising a
      shout of victory, impetuously pressed their retreat. But the
      battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and perhaps by
      the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided
      forever the alternative of empire or servitude. The last king of
      the Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were
      slaughtered or pursued, till they threw down their arms, and
      yielded to the mercy of the conqueror. Without discipline it was
      impossible for them to rally: they had contemptuously demolished
      the walls and fortifications which might have protected their
      distress; and they were followed into the heart of their forests
      by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than themselves. The
      great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis, whose sister
      Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he mildly
      interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and
      fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic
      territories, which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the
      prize of their conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or
      rebellious, to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of
      the Merovingian kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy
      their peculiar manners and institutions, under the government of
      official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. After the
      conquest of the Western provinces, the Franks alone maintained
      their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine. They gradually
      subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the
      Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was
      secured by the obedience of Germany. 24

      Till the thirtieth year of his age, Clovis continued to worship
      the gods of his ancestors. 25 His disbelief, or rather disregard,
      of Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse
      the churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul
      enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops
      entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater, than of the
      heretics. The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate
      alliance with the fair Clotilda, the niece of the king of
      Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was educated in
      the profession of the Catholic faith. It was her interest, as
      well as her duty, to achieve the conversion 26 of a Pagan
      husband; and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and
      religion. He consented (perhaps such terms had been previously
      stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son; and though the
      sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he
      was persuaded, a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment.
      In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked
      the God of Clotilda and the Christians; and victory disposed him
      to hear, with respectful gratitude, the eloquent 27 Remigius, 28
      bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and
      spiritual advantages of his conversion. The king declared himself
      satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the political
      reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were
      removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who
      showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to
      the field of battle, or to the baptismal font. The important
      ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims, with every
      circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an
      awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes. 29
      The new Constantine was immediately baptized, with three thousand
      of his warlike subjects; and their example was imitated by the
      remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to the
      victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and
      burnt the idols which they had formerly adored. 30 The mind of
      Clovis was susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by
      the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ; and,
      instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious
      sacrifice, he exclaimed, with indiscreet fury, “Had I been
      present at the head of my valiant Franks, I would have revenged
      his injuries.” 31 But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable
      of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends on the
      laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative
      theology. He was still more incapable of feeling the mild
      influence of the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart
      of a genuine convert. His ambitious reign was a perpetual
      violation of moral and Christian duties: his hands were stained
      with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as Clovis had
      dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he calmly assassinated
      all the princes of the Merovingian race. 32 Yet the king of the
      Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as a Being more
      excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal
      deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide
      in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts. Martin, the most
      popular of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame
      of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy
      sepulchre of Tours. His visible or invisible aid promoted the
      cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of
      Clovis himself, that St.Martin was an expensive friend, 33 need
      not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational
      scepticism. But earth, as well as heaven, rejoiced in the
      conversion of the Franks. On the memorable day when Clovis
      ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian
      world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king. The
      emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning
      the nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of
      Italy, Africa, Spain, and Gaul, were involved in the Arian
      heresy. The eldest, or rather the only, son of the church, was
      acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign, or glorious
      deliverer; and the armies of Clovis were strenuously supported by
      the zeal and fervor of the Catholic faction. 34

      Under the Roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the
      bishops, their sacred character, and perpetual office, their
      numerous dependants, popular eloquence, and provincial
      assemblies, had rendered them always respectable, and sometimes
      dangerous. Their influence was augmented with the progress of
      superstition; and the establishment of the French monarchy may,
      in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a hundred
      prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent, cities
      of Gaul. The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had
      been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still
      guarded their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the Roman
      name; and bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular
      attacks, of Clovis, who labored to extend his conquests from the
      Seine to the Loire. Their successful opposition introduced an
      equal and honorable union. The Franks esteemed the valor of the
      Armoricans 35 and the Armoricans were reconciled by the religion
      of the Franks. The military force which had been stationed for
      the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred different bands of
      cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the
      title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an
      incessant supply of the Barbarian youth. The extreme
      fortifications, and scattered fragments of the empire, were still
      defended by their hopeless courage. But their retreat was
      intercepted, and their communication was impracticable: they were
      abandoned by the Greek princes of Constantinople, and they
      piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of
      Gaul. They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous
      capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this
      spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was
      distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns,
      and their peculiar dress and institutions. But the national
      strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary
      accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers, as
      well as the spirit, of the Franks. The reduction of the Northern
      provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a
      single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the
      gradual operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each
      object of his ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as
      were adequate to its real value. His savage character, and the
      virtues of Henry IV., suggest the most opposite ideas of human
      nature; yet some resemblance may be found in the situation of two
      princes, who conquered France by their valor, their policy, and
      the merits of a seasonable conversion. 36

      The kingdom of the Burgundians, which was defined by the course
      of two Gallic rivers, the Saone and the Rhone, extended from the
      forest of Vosges to the Alps and the sea of Marscilles. 37 The
      sceptre was in the hands of Gundobald. That valiant and ambitious
      prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of
      two brothers, one of whom was the father of Clotilda; 38 but his
      imperfect prudence still permitted Godegisel, the youngest of his
      brothers, to possess the dependent principality of Geneva. The
      Arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction, and the
      hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the
      conversion of Clovis; and Gundobald convened at Lyons an assembly
      of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible, their
      religious and political discontents. A vain conference was
      agitated between the two factions. The Arians upbraided the
      Catholics with the worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended
      their cause by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments,
      objections, and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor;
      till the king revealed his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but
      decisive question, which he addressed to the orthodox bishops.
      “If you truly profess the Christian religion, why do you not
      restrain the king of the Franks? He has declared war against me,
      and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction. A
      sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere
      conversion: let him show his faith by his works.” The answer of
      Avitus, bishop of Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren,
      was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel. “We are
      ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks:
      but we are taught by Scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon
      the divine law are frequently subverted; and that enemies will
      arise on every side against those who have made God their enemy.
      Return, with thy people, to the law of God, and he will give
      peace and security to thy dominions.” The king of Burgundy, who
      was not prepared to accept the condition which the Catholics
      considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed the
      ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that
      Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the
      allegiance of his brother. 39

      The allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the
      obedience of Godegisel, who joined the royal standard with the
      troops of Geneva, more effectually promoted the success of the
      conspiracy. While the Franks and Burgundians contended with equal
      valor, his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle;
      and as Gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected Gauls,
      he yielded to the arms of Clovis, and hastily retreated from the
      field, which appears to have been situate between Langres and
      Dijon. He distrusted the strength of Dijon, a quadrangular
      fortress, encompassed by two rivers, and by a wall thirty feet
      high, and fifteen thick, with four gates, and thirty-three
      towers: 40 he abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important
      cities of Lyons and Vienna; and Gundobald still fled with
      precipitation, till he had reached Avignon, at the distance of
      two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle.

      A long siege and an artful negotiation, admonished the king of
      the Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. He
      imposed a tribute on the Burgundian prince, compelled him to
      pardon and reward his brother’s treachery, and proudly returned
      to his own dominions, with the spoils and captives of the
      southern provinces. This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the
      intelligence, that Gundobald had violated his recent obligations,
      and that the unfortunate Godegisel, who was left at Vienna with a
      garrison of five thousand Franks, 41 had been besieged,
      surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother. Such an outrage
      might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful
      sovereign; yet the conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury,
      released the tribute, and accepted the alliance, and military
      service, of the king of Burgundy. Clovis no longer possessed
      those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding
      war; and his rival, instructed by adversity, had found new
      resources in the affections of his people. The Gauls or Romans
      applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald, which almost
      raised them to the same level with their conquerors. The bishops
      were reconciled, and flattered, by the hopes, which he artfully
      suggested, of his approaching conversion; and though he eluded
      their accomplishment to the last moment of his life, his
      moderation secured the peace, and suspended the ruin, of the
      kingdom of Burgundy. 42

      the causes and the events.]

      I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which
      was accomplished under the reign of Sigismond, the son of
      Gundobald. The Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honors of a
      saint and martyr; 43 but the hands of the royal saint were
      stained with the blood of his innocent son, whom he inhumanly
      sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a step-mother. He soon
      discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss. While
      Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he
      received a severe admonition from one of his attendants: “It is
      not his situation, O king! it is thine which deserves pity and
      lamentation.” The reproaches of a guilty conscience were
      alleviated, however, by his liberal donations to the monastery of
      Agaunum, or St. Maurice, in Vallais; which he himself had founded
      in honor of the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion. 44 A
      full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious
      king; he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks;
      and it was his humble prayer, that Heaven would inflict in this
      world the punishment of his sins. His prayer was heard: the
      avengers were at hand: and the provinces of Burgundy were
      overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the event of
      an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his
      life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the
      desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed
      by his subjects, who solicited the favor of their new masters.
      The captive monarch, with his wife and two children, was
      transported to Orleans, and buried alive in a deep well, by the
      stern command of the sons of Clovis; whose cruelty might derive
      some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age.
      Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest of
      Burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety: and
      Clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of
      injuries, pressed them to revenge her father’s death on the
      family of his assassin. The rebellious Burgundians (for they
      attempted to break their chains) were still permitted to enjoy
      their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military
      service; and the Merovingian princes peaceably reigned over a
      kingdom, whose glory and greatness had been first overthrown by
      the arms of Clovis. 45

      The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honor of the Goths.
      They viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the
      youthful fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius
      of his rival. Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their
      contiguous dominions; and after the delays of fruitless
      negotiation, a personal interview of the two kings was proposed
      and accepted. The conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a
      small island of the Loire, near Amboise. They embraced,
      familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated with
      the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. But their
      apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and
      treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited,
      eluded, and disclaimed, a final arbitration. At Paris, which he
      already considered as his royal seat, Clovis declared to an
      assembly of the princes and warriors, the pretence, and the
      motive, of a Gothic war. “It grieves me to see that the Arians
      still possess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let us march against
      them with the aid of God; and, having vanquished the heretics, we
      will possess and divide their fertile provinces.” 46 The Franks,
      who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded
      the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution
      to conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally
      profitable; and solemnly protested that they would never shave
      their beards till victory should absolve them from that
      inconvenient vow. The enterprise was promoted by the public or
      private exhortations of Clotilda. She reminded her husband how
      effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity, and
      his servants: and the Christian hero, darting his battle-axe with
      a skilful and nervous band, “There, (said he,) on that spot where
      my Francisca, 47 shall fall, will I erect a church in honor of
      the holy apostles.” This ostentatious piety confirmed and
      justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly
      corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into
      a formidable conspiracy. The people of Aquitain were alarmed by
      the indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants, who justly
      accused them of preferring the dominion of the Franks: and their
      zealous adherent Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, 48 preached more
      forcibly in his exile than in his diocese. To resist these
      foreign and domestic enemies, who were fortified by the alliance
      of the Burgundians, Alaric collected his troops, far more
      numerous than the military powers of Clovis. The Visigoths
      resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in a long
      and luxurious peace; 49 a select band of valiant and robust
      slaves attended their masters to the field; 50 and the cities of
      Gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid.
      Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in Italy, had
      labored to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul; and he assumed, or
      affected, for that purpose, the impartial character of a
      mediator. But the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of
      Clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the national and
      religious cause of the Goths.

      The accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the
      expedition of Clovis, were accepted by a superstitious age, as
      the manifest declaration of the divine favor. He marched from
      Paris; and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy
      diocese of Tours, his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine
      of St. Martin, the sanctuary and the oracle of Gaul. His
      messengers were instructed to remark the words of the Psalm which
      should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they
      entered the church. Those words most fortunately expressed the
      valor and victory of the champions of Heaven, and the application
      was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new Gideon, who
      went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord. 51 Orleans
      secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance
      of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by
      an extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne; and the
      opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths.
      Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the
      country through which they march; and had Clovis possessed
      leisure and materials, it might have been impracticable to
      construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a
      superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants who were impatient
      to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown or
      unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the
      useful interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of
      singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march
      of the Catholic army. The counsels of the Visigoths were
      irresolute and distracted. A crowd of impatient warriors,
      presumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to fly before the
      robbers of Germany, excited Alaric to assert in arms the name and
      blood of the conquerors of Rome. The advice of the graver
      chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the Franks;
      and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and
      victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to
      his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle
      deliberation the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an
      advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was
      lost by their slow and disorderly motions. After Clovis had
      passed the ford, as it is still named, of the Hart, he advanced
      with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy. His
      nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended in
      the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which
      might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St.
      Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the
      Israelites in the desert. At the third hour of the day, about ten
      miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis overtook, and instantly attacked,
      the Gothic army; whose defeat was already prepared by terror and
      confusion. Yet they rallied in their extreme distress, and the
      martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused
      to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings encountered each
      other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and
      the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass,
      and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate
      Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of
      their sovereign. The vague expression of a mountain of the slain,
      serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter; but
      Gregory has carefully observed, that his valiant countryman
      Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius, lost his life at the head of
      the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps these suspected Catholics had
      been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy; and
      perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal
      attachment or military honor. 52

      decrees of councils, and repeatedly practised by kings, bishops,

      of Procopius, who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcassone, we

      author of the Gesta Francorum, that the battle was fought in
      campo Vocladensi, on the banks of the Clain, about ten miles to
      the south of Poitiers. Clovis overtook and attacked the Visigoths
      near Vivonne, and the victory was decided near a village still
      named Champagne St. Hilaire. See the Dissertations of the Abbe le
      Boeuf, tom. i. p. 304-331.]

      Such is the empire of Fortune, (if we may still disguise our
      ignorance under that popular name,) that it is almost equally
      difficult to foresee the events of war, or to explain their
      various consequences. A bloody and complete victory has sometimes
      yielded no more than the possession of the field; and the loss of
      ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy, in a
      single day, the work of ages. The decisive battle of Poitiers was
      followed by the conquest of Aquitain. Alaric had left behind him
      an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles, and a
      disloyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were
      oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other
      in civil discord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded
      without delay to the siege of Angoulême. At the sound of his
      trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho,
      and instantly fell to the ground; a splendid miracle, which may
      be reduced to the supposition, that some clerical engineers had
      secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart. 53 At
      Bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance, Clovis
      established his winter quarters; and his prudent economy
      transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures, which were
      deposited in the capital of the monarchy. The conqueror
      penetrated as far as the confines of Spain; 54 restored the
      honors of the Catholic church; fixed in Aquitain a colony of
      Franks; 55 and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of
      subduing, or extirpating, the nation of the Visigoths. But the
      Visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of
      Italy. While the balance was still equal, Theodoric had perhaps
      delayed the march of the Ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts
      successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis; and the army of the
      Franks, and their Burgundian allies, was compelled to raise the
      siege of Arles, with the loss, as it is said, of thirty thousand
      men. These vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to
      acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace. The Visigoths were
      suffered to retain the possession of Septimania, a narrow tract
      of sea-coast, from the Rhone to the Pyrenees; but the ample
      province of Aquitain, from those mountains to the Loire, was
      indissolubly united to the kingdom of France. 56

      After the success of the Gothic war, Clovis accepted the honors
      of the Roman consulship. The emperor Anastasius ambitiously
      bestowed on the most powerful rival of Theodoric the title and
      ensigns of that eminent dignity; yet, from some unknown cause,
      the name of Clovis has not been inscribed in the Fasti either of
      the East or West. 57 On the solemn day, the monarch of Gaul,
      placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in the church of St.
      Martin, with a purple tunic and mantle. From thence he proceeded
      on horseback to the cathedral of Tours; and, as he passed through
      the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative
      of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly
      repeated their acclamations of Consul and Augustus. The actual or
      legal authority of Clovis could not receive any new accessions
      from the consular dignity. It was a name, a shadow, an empty
      pageant; and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the
      ancient prerogatives of that high office, they must have expired
      with the period of its annual duration. But the Romans were
      disposed to revere, in the person of their master, that antique
      title which the emperors condescended to assume: the Barbarian
      himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the
      majesty of the republic; and the successors of Theodosius, by
      soliciting his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified,
      the usurpation of Gaul.

      57 (return) [ The Fasti of Italy would naturally reject a consul,
      the enemy of their sovereign; but any ingenious hypothesis that
      might explain the silence of Constantinople and Egypt, (the

      similar silence of Marius, bishop of Avenche, who composed his
      Fasti in the kingdom of Burgundy. If the evidence of Gregory of
      Tours were less weighty and positive, (l. ii. c. 38, in tom. ii.
      p. 183,) I could believe that Clovis, like Odoacer, received the
      lasting title and honors of Patrician, (Pagi Critica, tom. ii. p.
      474, 492.)]

      Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis this important
      concession was more formally declared, in a treaty between his
      sons and the emperor Justinian. The Ostrogoths of Italy, unable
      to defend their distant acquisitions, had resigned to the Franks
      the cities of Arles and Marseilles; of Arles, still adorned with
      the seat of a Prætorian præfect, and of Marseilles, enriched by
      the advantages of trade and navigation. 58 This transaction was
      confirmed by the Imperial authority; and Justinian, generously
      yielding to the Franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond
      the Alps, which they already possessed, absolved the provincials
      from their allegiance; and established on a more lawful, though
      not more solid, foundation, the throne of the Merovingians. 59
      From that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at Arles the
      games of the circus; and by a singular privilege, which was
      denied even to the Persian monarch, the gold coin, impressed with
      their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the empire. 60
      A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and public
      virtues of the Franks, with a partial enthusiasm, which cannot be
      sufficiently justified by their domestic annals. 61 He celebrates
      their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and
      orthodox religion; and boldly asserts, that these Barbarians
      could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the
      subjects of Rome. Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social
      disposition, and lively graces, which, in every age, have
      disguised their vices, and sometimes concealed their intrinsic
      merit. Perhaps Agathias, and the Greeks, were dazzled by the
      rapid progress of their arms, and the splendor of their empire.
      Since the conquest of Burgundy, Gaul, except the Gothic province
      of Septimania, was subject, in its whole extent, to the sons of
      Clovis. They had extinguished the German kingdom of Thuringia,
      and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine, into the
      heart of their native forests. The Alemanni, and Bavarians, who
      had occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum, to the
      south of the Danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of
      the Franks; and the feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of
      resisting their ambition. When the last survivor of the sons of
      Clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the Merovingians,
      his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern France. Yet
      modern France, such has been the progress of arts and policy, far
      surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power, the spacious but
      savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert. 62

      ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of
      gold. It was the common standard of the Barbaric fines, and
      contained forty denarii, or silver three pences. Twelve of these
      denarii made a solidus, or shilling, the twentieth part of the
      ponderal and numeral livre, or pound of silver, which has been so

      The Franks, or French, are the only people of Europe who can
      deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western
      empire. But their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries
      of anarchy and ignorance. On the revival of learning, the
      students, who had been formed in the schools of Athens and Rome,
      disdained their Barbarian ancestors; and a long period elapsed
      before patient labor could provide the requisite materials to
      satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity of more enlightened
      times. 63 At length the eye of criticism and philosophy was
      directed to the antiquities of France; but even philosophers have
      been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion. The most
      extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal servitude of the
      Gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the Franks,
      have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and the
      intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring
      against the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles,
      or the freedom of the people. Yet the sharp conflict has usefully
      exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius; and each
      antagonist, alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated
      some ancient errors, and established some interesting truths. An
      impartial stranger, instructed by their discoveries, their
      disputes, and even their faults, may describe, from the same
      original materials, the state of the Roman provincials, after

      France, 2 vols. 12mo.)]

      The rudest, or the most servile, condition of human society, is
      regulated, however, by some fixed and general rules. When Tacitus
      surveyed the primitive simplicity of the Germans, he discovered
      some permanent maxims, or customs, of public and private life,
      which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction
      of the art of writing, and of the Latin tongue. 65 Before the
      election of the Merovingian kings, the most powerful tribe, or
      nation, of the Franks, appointed four venerable chieftains to
      compose the Salic laws; 66 and their labors were examined and
      approved in three successive assemblies of the people. After the
      baptism of Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared
      incompatible with Christianity: the Salic law was again amended
      by his sons; and at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code
      was revised and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years
      after the establishment of the French monarchy. Within the same
      period, the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and
      published; and Charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and
      country, had accurately studied the two national laws, which
      still prevailed among the Franks. 67 The same care was extended
      to their vassals; and the rude institutions of the Alemanni and
      Bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme
      authority of the Merovingian kings. The Visigoths and
      Burgundians, whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the
      Franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal
      benefits of civilized society. Euric was the first of the Gothic
      princes who expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his
      people; and the composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure
      of policy rather than of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and
      regain the affections, of their Gallic subjects. 68 Thus, by a
      singular coincidence, the Germans framed their artless
      institutions, at a time when the elaborate system of Roman
      jurisprudence was finally consummated. In the Salic laws, and the
      Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and
      the full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may
      be suggested in favor of Barbarism, our calmer reflections will
      ascribe to the Romans the superior advantages, not only of
      science and reason, but of humanity and justice. Yet the laws 681
      of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their
      occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to
      preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of the society
      for whose use they were originally established. The Merovingians,
      instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their various
      subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their
      empire, freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; 69 nor were
      the Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal
      toleration. 70 The children embraced the law of their parents,
      the wife that of her husband, the freedman that of his patron;
      and in all causes where the parties were of different nations,
      the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of
      the defendant, who may always plead a judicial presumption of
      right, or innocence. A more ample latitude was allowed, if every
      citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law

      he chose to belong. Such an indulgence would abolish the partial
      distinctions of victory: and the Roman provincials might
      patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition; since it
      depended on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to
      assert the character, of free and warlike Barbarians. 71

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part III.

      When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each
      private citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the
      magistrate, and the whole community, are the guardians of his
      personal safety. But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge
      was always honorable, and often meritorious: the independent
      warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries
      which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the
      resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy, whom he had
      sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate,
      conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to
      reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel
      the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine
      which had been ascertained as the price of blood. 72 The fierce
      spirit of the Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence;
      the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints; and,
      when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of
      Gaul, the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty
      or deliberate guilt. In every just government the same penalty is
      inflicted, or at least is imposed, for the murder of a peasant or
      a prince. But the national inequality established by the Franks,
      in their criminal proceedings, was the last insult and abuse of
      conquest. 73 In the calm moments of legislation, they solemnly
      pronounced, that the life of a Roman was of smaller value than
      that of a Barbarian. The Antrustion, 74 a name expressive of the
      most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks, was
      appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold; while the
      noble provincial, who was admitted to the king’s table, might be
      legally murdered at the expense of three hundred pieces.

      Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary
      condition; but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and
      danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred, or even fifty,
      pieces of gold. Had these laws been regulated by any principle of
      equity or reason, the public protection should have supplied, in
      just proportion, the want of personal strength. But the
      legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of
      policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave: the head
      of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by a heavy
      fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless
      subjects. Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and
      the patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was
      taught, by experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he
      could inflict. As the manners of the Franks became less
      ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe; and the
      Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigor of the
      Visigoths and Burgundians. 75 Under the empire of Charlemagne,
      murder was universally punished with death; and the use of
      capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the
      jurisprudence of modern Europe. 76

      72 (return) [ In the heroic times of Greece, the guilt of murder
      was expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the
      deceased, (Feithius Antiquitat. Homeric. l. ii. c. 8.)
      Heineccius, in his preface to the Elements of Germanic Law,
      favorably suggests, that at Rome and Athens homicide was only
      punished with exile. It is true: but exile was a capital
      punishment for a citizen of Rome or Athens.]

      73 (return) [ This proportion is fixed by the Salic (tit. xliv.
      in tom. iv. p. 147) and the Ripuarian (tit. vii. xi. xxxvi. in
      tom. iv. p. 237, 241) laws: but the latter does not distinguish
      any difference of Romans. Yet the orders of the clergy are placed
      above the Franks themselves, and the Burgundians and Alemanni
      between the Franks and the Romans.]

      displeased to mortify the pride of birth (Esprit, l. xxx. c. 25)

      evidently of Austrasia, (in tom. iv. p. 112.) Their premature
      severity was sometimes rash, and excessive. Childebert condemned
      not only murderers but robbers; quomodo sine lege involavit, sine
      lege moriatur; and even the negligent judge was involved in the
      same sentence. The Visigoths abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to
      the family of his deceased patient, ut quod de eo facere
      voluerint habeant potestatem, (l. xi. tit. i. in tom. iv. p.

      for murder have been traced in Germany as late as the sixteenth
      century.]

      The civil and military professions, which had been separated by
      Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound
      of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles
      of Duke, of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed,
      within his district, the command of the troops, and the
      administration of justice. 77 But the fierce and illiterate
      chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a
      judge, which required all the faculties of a philosophic mind,
      laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and his rude
      ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple, and visible,
      methods of ascertaining the cause of justice. In every religion,
      the Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the
      falsehood of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was
      misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the German
      legislators. The party accused might justify his innocence, by
      producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses,
      who solemnly declared their belief, or assurance, that he was not
      guilty. According to the weight of the charge, this legal number
      of compurgators was multiplied; seventy-two voices were required
      to absolve an incendiary or assassin: and when the chastity of a
      queen of France was suspected, three hundred gallant nobles
      swore, without hesitation, that the infant prince had been
      actually begotten by her deceased husband. 78 The sin and scandal
      of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to
      remove these dangerous temptations; and to supply the defects of
      human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water.
      These extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived, that,
      in some cases, guilt, and innocence in others, could not be
      proved without the interposition of a miracle. Such miracles were
      really provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes
      were determined by this easy and infallible method, and the
      turbulent Barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of
      the magistrate, submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God.

      bosom.]

      But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior
      credit and authority, among a warlike people, who could not
      believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward
      deserved to live. 80 Both in civil and criminal proceedings, the
      plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were
      exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute
      of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert
      their cause, or publicly to maintain their honor, in the lists of
      battle. They fought either on foot, or on horseback, according to
      the custom of their nation; 81 and the decision of the sword, or
      lance, was ratified by the sanction of Heaven, of the judge, and
      of the people. This sanguinary law was introduced into Gaul by
      the Burgundians; and their legislator Gundobald 82 condescended
      to answer the complaints and objections of his subject Avitus.
      “Is it not true,” said the king of Burgundy to the bishop, “that
      the event of national wars, and private combats, is directed by
      the judgment of God; and that his providence awards the victory
      to the juster cause?” By such prevailing arguments, the absurd
      and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to
      some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the
      monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic. At the end of
      ten centuries, the reign of legal violence was not totally
      extinguished; and the ineffectual censures of saints, of popes,
      and of synods, may seem to prove, that the influence of
      superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason
      and humanity. The tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps,
      of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favors
      the rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble,
      and the infirm, were condemned, either to renounce their fairest
      claims and possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal
      conflict, 83 or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary
      champion. This oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the
      provincials of Gaul, who complained of any injuries in their
      persons and property. Whatever might be the strength, or courage,
      of individuals, the victorious Barbarians excelled in the love
      and exercise of arms; and the vanquished Roman was unjustly
      summoned to repeat, in his own person, the bloody contest which
      had been already decided against his country. 84

      A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had
      formerly passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One
      third part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated
      to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive
      demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of
      twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom he had invited to share the
      rich harvest of Gaul. 85 At the distance of five hundred years,
      the Visigoths and Burgundians, who revenged the defeat of
      Ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds of
      the subject lands. But this distribution, instead of spreading
      over the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar
      districts where the victorious people had been planted by their
      own choice, or by the policy of their leader. In these districts,
      each Barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some
      Roman provincial. To this unwelcome guest, the proprietor was
      compelled to abandon two thirds of his patrimony, but the German,
      a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes content himself with a
      spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign the smallest,
      though most valuable, portion, to the toil of the industrious
      husbandman. 86 The silence of ancient and authentic testimony has
      encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of the Franks was not
      moderated, or disguised, by the forms of a legal division; that
      they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul, without
      order or control; and that each victorious robber, according to
      his wants, his avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword
      the extent of his new inheritance. At a distance from their
      sovereign, the Barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise
      such arbitrary depredation; but the firm and artful policy of
      Clovis must curb a licentious spirit, which would aggravate the
      misery of the vanquished, whilst it corrupted the union and
      discipline of the conquerors. 861 The memorable vase of Soissons
      is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the
      Gallic spoils. It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to
      provide rewards for a successful army, settlements for a numerous
      people; without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on
      the loyal Catholics of Gaul. The ample fund, which he might
      lawfully acquire, of the Imperial patrimony, vacant lands, and
      Gothic usurpations, would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure
      and confiscation, and the humble provincials would more patiently
      acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss. 87

      seems to have been ascertained by the judgment of the

      remaining third; and that the Romans might recover their right,

      their ancient possessions on the Waal and the Rhine. The
      adventurers alone had formed the invading force, and they always

      laws retained no traces of the partition of the Roman properties.

      The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their
      extensive domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still
      delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities
      were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their
      charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of
      the villas, or rural palaces, in which they successively resided.

      One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not
      excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered
      through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim
      the honors of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed
      only in the light of profitable farms. The mansion of the
      long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and
      stables, for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted
      with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labors of
      agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were
      exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign;
      his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or
      consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the
      strictest maxims of private economy. 88 This ample patrimony was
      appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his
      successors; and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions
      who, both in peace and war, were devoted to their personal
      service. Instead of a horse, or a suit of armor, each companion,
      according to his rank, or merit, or favor, was invested with a
      benefice, the primitive name, and most simple form, of the feudal
      possessions. These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the
      sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from
      the influence of his liberality. 881 But this dependent tenure
      was gradually abolished 89 by the independent and rapacious
      nobles of France, who established the perpetual property, and
      hereditary succession, of their benefices; a revolution salutary
      to the earth, which had been injured, or neglected, by its
      precarious masters. 90 Besides these royal and beneficiary
      estates, a large proportion had been assigned, in the division of
      Gaul, of allodial and Salic lands: they were exempt from tribute,
      and the Salic lands were equally shared among the male
      descendants of the Franks. 91

      In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a
      new order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the
      appellation of Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and
      a license to oppress, the subjects of their peculiar territory.
      Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an
      equal: but the laws were extinguished; and the sacrilegious
      Barbarians, who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or
      bishop, 92 would seldom respect the landmarks of a profane and
      defenceless neighbor. The common or public rights of nature, such
      as they had always been deemed by the Roman jurisprudence, 93
      were severely restrained by the German conquerors, whose
      amusement, or rather passion, was the exercise of hunting. The
      vague dominion which Man has assumed over the wild inhabitants of
      the earth, the air, and the waters, was confined to some
      fortunate individuals of the human species. Gaul was again
      overspread with woods; and the animals, who were reserved for the
      use or pleasure of the lord, might ravage with impunity the
      fields of his industrious vassals. The chase was the sacred
      privilege of the nobles and their domestic servants. Plebeian
      transgressors were legally chastised with stripes and
      imprisonment; 94 but in an age which admitted a slight
      composition for the life of a citizen, it was a capital crime to
      destroy a stag or a wild bull within the precincts of the royal
      forests. 95

      According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the
      lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: 96 and
      the fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost
      suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of Rome, was again revived
      and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent
      Barbarians. The Goth, the Burgundian, or the Frank, who returned
      from a successful expedition, dragged after him a long train of
      sheep, of oxen, and of human captives, whom he treated with the
      same brutal contempt. The youths of an elegant form and an
      ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a
      doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the
      favorable or cruel impulse of passion. The useful mechanics and
      servants (smiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks,
      gardeners, dyers, and workmen in gold and silver, &c.) employed
      their skill for the use, or profit, of their master. But the
      Roman captives, who were destitute of art, but capable of labor,
      were condemned, without regard to their former rank, to tend the
      cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians. The number of
      the hereditary bondsmen, who were attached to the Gallic estates,
      was continually increased by new supplies; and the servile
      people, according to the situation and temper of their lords, was
      sometimes raised by precarious indulgence, and more frequently
      depressed by capricious despotism. 97 An absolute power of life
      and death was exercised by these lords; and when they married
      their daughters, a train of useful servants, chained on the
      wagons to prevent their escape, was sent as a nuptial present
      into a distant country. 98 The majesty of the Roman laws
      protected the liberty of each citizen, against the rash effects
      of his own distress or despair. But the subjects of the
      Merovingian kings might alienate their personal freedom; and this
      act of legal suicide, which was familiarly practised, is
      expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity
      of human nature. 99 The example of the poor, who purchased life
      by the sacrifice of all that can render life desirable, was
      gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in times of
      public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves
      under the battlements of a powerful chief, and around the shrine
      of a popular saint. Their submission was accepted by these
      temporal or spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction
      irrecoverably fixed their own condition, and that of their latest
      posterity. From the reign of Clovis, during five successive
      centuries, the laws and manners of Gaul uniformly tended to
      promote the increase, and to confirm the duration, of personal
      servitude. Time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate
      ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow interval between
      the noble and the slave. This arbitrary and recent division has
      been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national
      distinction, universally established by the arms and the laws of
      the Merovingians. The nobles, who claimed their genuine or
      fabulous descent from the independent and victorious Franks, have
      asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a
      prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians, to whom they imputed the
      imaginary disgrace of Gallic or Roman extraction.

      The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was
      imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular
      example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family.
      Auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the
      independent states and cities of Gaul. The brave and numerous
      inhabitants displayed a singular trophy; the sword of Caesar
      himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls
      of Gergovia. 100 As the common offspring of Troy, they claimed a
      fraternal alliance with the Romans; 101 and if each province had
      imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne, the fall of the
      Western empire might have been prevented or delayed. They firmly
      maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the
      Visigoths, out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle
      of Poitiers, they accepted, without resistance, a victorious and
      Catholic sovereign. This easy and valuable conquest was achieved
      and possessed by Theodoric, the eldest son of Clovis: but the
      remote province was separated from his Austrasian dominions, by
      the intermediate kingdoms of Soissons, Paris, and Orleans, which
      formed, after their father’s death, the inheritance of his three
      brothers. The king of Paris, Childebert, was tempted by the
      neighborhood and beauty of Auvergne. 102 The Upper country, which
      rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes,
      presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures; the
      sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was
      crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne, the River
      Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and
      the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still
      supplies, without any interval of repose, the constant repetition
      of the same harvests. 103 On the false report, that their lawful
      sovereign had been slain in Germany, the city and diocese of
      Auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris.
      Childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory; and the free
      subjects of Theodoric threatened to desert his standard, if he
      indulged his private resentment, while the nation was engaged in
      the Burgundian war. But the Franks of Austrasia soon yielded to
      the persuasive eloquence of their king. “Follow me,” said
      Theodoric, “into Auvergne; I will lead you into a province, where
      you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious
      apparel, to the full extent of your wishes. I repeat my promise;
      I give you the people and their wealth as your prey; and you may
      transport them at pleasure into your own country.” By the
      execution of this promise, Theodoric justly forfeited the
      allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction. His
      troops, reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of Germany, 104
      spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne; and two
      places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or
      redeemed from their licentious fury. The castle of Meroliac 105
      was seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the
      surface of the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was
      enclosed, with some arable lands, within the circle of its
      fortifications. The Franks beheld with envy and despair this
      impregnable fortress; but they surprised a party of fifty
      stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number of their
      captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of
      life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel
      Barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the
      garrison. Another detachment penetrated as far as Brivas, or
      Brioude, where the inhabitants, with their valuable effects, had
      taken refuge in the sanctuary of St. Julian. The doors of the
      church resisted the assault; but a daring soldier entered through
      a window of the choir, and opened a passage to his companions.
      The clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils, were
      rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was
      made at a small distance from the town of Brioude. But this act
      of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis. He
      punished with death the most atrocious offenders; left their
      secret accomplices to the vengeance of St. Julian; released the
      captives; restored the plunder; and extended the rights of
      sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr. 106

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part IV.

      Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne, Theodoric
      exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose
      just hatred could be restrained only by their fear. A select band
      of noble youths, the sons of the principal senators, was
      delivered to the conqueror, as the hostages of the faith of
      Childebert, and of their countrymen. On the first rumor of war,
      or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of
      servitude; and one of them, Attalus, 107 whose adventures are
      more particularly related, kept his master’s horses in the
      diocese of Treves. After a painful search, he was discovered, in
      this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather,
      Gregory bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly
      rejected by the avarice of the Barbarian, who required an
      exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble
      captive. His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of
      Leo, a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres.
      108 An unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family.
      The Barbarian purchased Leo for the price of twelve pieces of
      gold; and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the
      luxury of an episcopal table: “Next Sunday,” said the Frank, “I
      shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. Exert thy art, and force
      them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an
      entertainment, even in the king’s house.” Leo assured him, that
      if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes
      should be satisfied. The master who already aspired to the merit
      of elegant hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the
      voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the
      dexterous Leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his
      household. After the patient expectation of a whole year, he
      cautiously whispered his design to Attalus, and exhorted him to
      prepare for flight in the ensuing night. At the hour of midnight,
      the intemperate guests retired from the table; and the Frank’s
      son-in-law, whom Leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal
      potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which he
      might betray his trust. The intrepid slave, after sustaining this
      dangerous raillery, entered his master’s bedchamber; removed his
      spear and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the
      stable; unbarred the ponderous gates; and excited Attalus to save
      his life and liberty by incessant diligence. Their apprehensions
      urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the Meuse; 109
      they swam the river, wandered three days in the adjacent forest,
      and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild
      plum-tree. As they lay concealed in a dark thicket, they heard
      the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry countenance
      of their master, and they anxiously listened to his declaration,
      that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them he
      would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on
      a gibbet. A length, Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the
      friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their
      fainting strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the
      search of their enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the
      limits of the Austrasian kingdom, to the episcopal palace of
      Langres. Gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy,
      gratefully delivered Leo, with his whole family, from the yoke of
      servitude, and bestowed on him the property of a farm, where he
      might end his days in happiness and freedom. Perhaps this
      singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances of
      truth and nature, was related by Attalus himself, to his cousin
      or nephew, the first historian of the Franks. Gregory of Tours
      110 was born about sixty years after the death of Sidonius
      Apollinaris; and their situation was almost similar, since each
      of them was a native of Auvergne, a senator, and a bishop. The
      difference of their style and sentiments may, therefore, express
      the decay of Gaul; and clearly ascertain how much, in so short a
      space, the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement. 111

      year 532, with a friend of Silonius of the same name, who was
      count of Autun, fifty or sixty years before. Such an error, which

      We are now qualified to despise the opposite, and, perhaps,
      artful, misrepresentations, which have softened, or exaggerated,
      the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the
      Merovingians. The conquerors never promulgated any universal
      edict of servitude, or confiscation; but a degenerate people, who
      excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and
      peace, was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious
      Barbarians, who contemptuously insulted their possessions, their
      freedom, and their safety. Their personal injuries were partial
      and irregular; but the great body of the Romans survived the
      revolution, and still preserved the property, and privileges, of
      citizens. A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use
      of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from
      tribute; 112 and the same irresistible violence which swept away
      the arts and manufactures of Gaul, destroyed the elaborate and
      expensive system of Imperial despotism. The Provincials must
      frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or
      Ripuarian laws; but their private life, in the important concerns
      of marriage, testaments, or inheritance, was still regulated by
      the Theodosian Code; and a discontented Roman might freely
      aspire, or descend, to the title and character of a Barbarian.
      The honors of the state were accessible to his ambition: the
      education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly qualified them
      for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as emulation
      had rekindled their military ardor, they were permitted to march
      in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans. I
      shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates,
      whose names 113 attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians.
      The supreme command of Burgundy, with the title of Patrician, was
      successively intrusted to three Romans; and the last, and most
      powerful, Mummolus, 114 who alternately saved and disturbed the
      monarchy, had supplanted his father in the station of count of
      Autun, and left a treasury of thirty talents of gold, and two
      hundred and fifty talents of silver. The fierce and illiterate
      Barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from the
      dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. 115 The
      clergy of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials;
      the haughty Franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were
      dignified with the episcopal character: and the power and riches
      which had been lost in war, were insensibly recovered by
      superstition. 116 In all temporal affairs, the Theodosian Code
      was the universal law of the clergy; but the Barbaric
      jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety; a
      sub-deacon was equivalent to two Franks; the antrustion, and
      priest, were held in similar estimation: and the life of a bishop
      was appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of
      nine hundred pieces of gold. 117 The Romans communicated to their
      conquerors the use of the Christian religion and Latin language;
      118 but their language and their religion had alike degenerated
      from the simple purity of the Augustan, and Apostolic age. The
      progress of superstition and Barbarism was rapid and universal:
      the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the God of
      the Christians; and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers
      was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and pronunciation. Yet such
      intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the
      distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of Gaul were
      gradually confounded under the name and government of the Franks.

      The Franks, after they mingled with their Gallic subjects, might
      have imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and
      system of constitutional liberty. Under a king, hereditary, but
      limited, the chiefs and counsellors might have debated at Paris,
      in the palace of the Caesars: the adjacent field, where the
      emperors reviewed their mercenary legions, would have admitted
      the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors; and the rude
      model, which had been sketched in the woods of Germany, 119 might
      have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the
      Romans. But the careless Barbarians, secure of their personal
      independence, disdained the labor of government: the annual
      assemblies of the month of March were silently abolished; and the
      nation was separated, and almost dissolved, by the conquest of
      Gaul. 120 The monarchy was left without any regular establishment
      of justice, of arms, or of revenue. The successors of Clovis
      wanted resolution to assume, or strength to exercise, the
      legislative and executive powers, which the people had abdicated:
      the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample
      privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so often
      invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among
      the licentious Franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire
      of impunity. Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his
      grandson, Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the
      Gothic possessions of Septimania, or Languedoc. The troops of
      Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne, and the adjacent territories, were
      excited by the hopes of spoil. They marched, without discipline,
      under the banners of German, or Gallic, counts: their attack was
      feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly and hostile provinces
      were desolated with indiscriminate rage. The cornfields, the
      villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by fire: the
      inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and, in
      the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages
      were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. When the pious
      Gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and
      threatened to inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and
      arbitrary execution, they accused the universal and incurable
      corruption of the people. “No one,” they said, “any longer fears
      or respects his king, his duke, or his count. Each man loves to
      do evil, and freely indulges his criminal inclinations. The most
      gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult, and the rash
      magistrate, who presumes to censure or restrain his seditious
      subjects, seldom escapes alive from their revenge.” 121 It has
      been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate
      vices, the most odious abuse of freedom; and to supply its loss
      by the spirit of honor and humanity, which now alleviates and
      dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign. 1211

      The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the greatest part of their
      Gallic possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the
      easy conquest, and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain.
      From the monarchy of the Goths, which soon involved the Suevic
      kingdom of Gallicia, the modern Spaniards still derive some
      national vanity; but the historian of the Roman empire is neither
      invited, nor compelled, to pursue the obscure and barren series
      of their annals. 122 The Goths of Spain were separated from the
      rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains:
      their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to the
      Germanic tribes, have been already explained. I have anticipated,
      in the preceding chapter, the most important of their
      ecclesiastical events, the fall of Arianism, and the persecution
      of the Jews; and it only remains to observe some interesting
      circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical
      constitution of the Spanish kingdom.

      122 (return) [ Spain, in these dark ages, has been peculiarly
      unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or
      Angles, a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &c. But the
      history of the Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect
      Chronicles of Isidore of Seville and John of Biclar]

      After their conversion from idolatry or heresy, the Frank and the
      Visigoths were disposed to embrace, with equal submission, the
      inherent evils and the accidental benefits, of superstition. But
      the prelates of France, long before the extinction of the
      Merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting
      Barbarians. They disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of
      temperance and chastity; and preferred the indulgence of private
      ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal
      profession. 123 The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and
      were respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised
      their vices, and confirmed their authority; and the regular
      discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability,
      into the government of the state. From the reign of Recared, the
      first Catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate predecessor
      of the unfortunate Roderic, sixteen national councils were
      successively convened. The six metropolitans, Toledo, Seville,
      Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided according to
      their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their
      suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies;
      and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the
      Spanish abbots. During the first three days of the convocation,
      as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine
      and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from their
      debates; which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity.
      But, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open
      for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes
      and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the
      Gothic nobles, and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the
      consent of the people.

      The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the
      annual synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to
      redress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the
      prevailing influence of the Spanish clergy. The bishops, who, in
      each revolution, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to
      insult the prostrate labored, with diligence and success, to
      kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the mitre above
      the crown. Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free
      spirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal
      policy, have established some prudent laws for the common benefit
      of the king and people. The vacancy of the throne was supplied by
      the choice of the bishops and palatines; and after the failure of
      the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the
      pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who anointed their
      lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes practised, the
      duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were denounced on
      the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his
      authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent
      union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch himself,
      when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to
      God and his people, that he would faithfully execute this
      important trust. The real or imaginary faults of his
      administration were subject to the control of a powerful
      aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a
      fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded,
      imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or
      confiscation, unless by the free and public judgment of their
      peers. 124

      123 (return) [ Such are the complaints of St. Boniface, the
      apostle of Germany, and the reformer of Gaul, (in tom. iv. p.

      corruption, would seem to insinuate that the Barbarians were
      admitted into the clergy about the year 660.]

      124 (return) [ The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the
      most authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain.
      The following passages are particularly important, (iii. 17, 18;
      iv. 75; v. 2, 3, 4, 5, 8; vi. 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18; vii. 1;
      xiii. 2 3 6.) I have found Mascou (Hist. of the Ancient Germans,
      xv. 29, and Annotations, xxvi. and xxxiii.) and Ferreras (Hist.
      Generale de l’Espagne, tom. ii.) very useful and accurate
      guides.]

      One of these legislative councils of Toledo examined and ratified
      the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of
      Gothic kings, from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long
      as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs
      of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of Aquitain and
      Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law. Their gradual
      improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion,
      encouraged them to imitate, and to supersede, these foreign
      institutions; and to compose a code of civil and criminal
      jurisprudence, for the use of a great and united people. The same
      obligations, and the same privileges, were communicated to the
      nations of the Spanish monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly
      renouncing the Teutonic idiom, submitted to the restraints of
      equity, and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom.
      The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation
      of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths. The provincials were
      long separated from their Arian masters by the irreconcilable
      difference of religion. After the conversion of Recared had
      removed the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the
      Ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern
      emperors; who secretly excited a discontented people to reject
      the yoke of the Barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of
      Roman citizens. The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed
      most effectually secured by their own persuasion, that they
      hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a
      revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom
      we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the
      praise of wisdom and moderation. 125

      125 (return) [ The Code of the Visigoths, regularly divided into
      twelve books, has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet, (in

      Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 1) with excessive
      severity. I dislike the style; I detest the superstition; but I
      shall presume to think, that the civil jurisprudence displays a
      more civilized and enlightened state of society, than that of the
      Burgundians, or even of the Lombards.]

      While the kingdom of the Franks and Visigoths were established in
      Gaul and Spain, the Saxons achieved the conquest of Britain, the
      third great diocese of the Praefecture of the West. Since Britain
      was already separated from the Roman empire, I might, without
      reproach, decline a story familiar to the most illiterate, and
      obscure to the most learned, of my readers. The Saxons, who
      excelled in the use of the oar, or the battle-axe, were ignorant
      of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their
      exploits; the Provincials, relapsing into barbarism, neglected to
      describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful tradition
      was almost extinguished, before the missionaries of Rome restored
      the light of science and Christianity. The declamations of
      Gildas, the fragments, or fables, of Nennius, the obscure hints
      of the Saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of
      the venerable Bede, 126 have been illustrated by the diligence,
      and sometimes embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers,
      whose works I am not ambitious either to censure or to
      transcribe. 127 Yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to
      pursue the revolutions of a Roman province, till it vanishes from
      his sight; and an Englishman may curiously trace the
      establishment of the Barbarians, from whom he derives his name,
      his laws, and perhaps his origin.

      About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government,
      Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious
      command of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate
      monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and
      mischievous policy of inviting 128 a formidable stranger, to
      repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe. His ambassadors
      are despatched, by the gravest historians, to the coast of
      Germany: they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly
      of the Saxons, and those warlike Barbarians resolve to assist
      with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown
      island. If Britain had indeed been unknown to the Saxons, the
      measure of its calamities would have been less complete. But the
      strength of the Roman government could not always guard the
      maritime province against the pirates of Germany; the independent
      and divided states were exposed to their attacks; and the Saxons
      might sometimes join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or
      express, confederacy of rapine and destruction. Vortigern could
      only balance the various perils, which assaulted on every side
      his throne and his people; and his policy may deserve either
      praise or excuse, if he preferred the alliance of those
      Barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous
      enemies and the most serviceable allies. Hengist and Horsa, as
      they ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships, were
      engaged, by the promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the
      defence of Britain; and their intrepid valor soon delivered the
      country from the Caledonian invaders. The Isle of Thanet, a
      secure and fertile district, was allotted for the residence of
      these German auxiliaries, and they were supplied, according to
      the treaty, with a plentiful allowance of clothing and
      provisions. This favorable reception encouraged five thousand
      warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels, and
      the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and
      seasonable reenforcement. The crafty Barbarian suggested to
      Vortigern the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighborhood of
      the Picts, a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty
      ships, under the command of his son and nephew, sailed from
      Germany, ravaged the Orkneys, and disembarked a new army on the
      coast of Northumberland, or Lothian, at the opposite extremity of
      the devoted land. It was easy to foresee, but it was impossible
      to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations were soon
      divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. The Saxons
      magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an
      ungrateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal
      rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty
      mercenaries. The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an
      irreconcilable quarrel. The Saxons flew to arms; and if they
      perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a
      feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains
      the intercourse of peace and war. 129

      the rash attempt to embody them in an Epic Poem, called Samor,
      commenced at Eton, and finished before he had arrived at the

      Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain, exhorted
      his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in
      lively colors the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the
      cities, the pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the
      convenient situation of a spacious solitary island, accessible on
      all sides to the Saxon fleets. The successive colonies which
      issued, in the period of a century, from the mouths of the Elbe,
      the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally composed of three
      valiant tribes or nations of Germany; the Jutes, the old Saxons,
      and the Angles. The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner
      of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the
      paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the first independent
      kingdom. The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the
      primitive Saxons; and the common laws and language of the
      conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people,
      which, at the end of four hundred years, produced the first
      monarchs of South Britain. The Angles were distinguished by their
      numbers and their success; and they claimed the honor of fixing a
      perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied the most
      ample portion. The Barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine
      either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this
      triple confederacy; the Frisians, who had been tempted by their
      vicinity to the British shores, might balance, during a short
      space, the strength and reputation of the native Saxons; the
      Danes, the Prussians, the Rugians, are faintly described; and
      some adventurous Huns, who had wandered as far as the Baltic,
      might embark on board the German vessels, for the conquest of a
      new world. 130 But this arduous achievement was not prepared or
      executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid
      chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes,
      assembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of
      sixty, vessels; chose the place of the attack; and conducted his
      subsequent operations according to the events of the war, and the
      dictates of his private interest. In the invasion of Britain many
      heroes vanquished and fell; but only seven victorious leaders
      assumed, or at least maintained, the title of kings. Seven
      independent thrones, the Saxon Heptarchy, 1301 were founded by
      the conquerors, and seven families, one of which has been
      continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign,
      derived their equal and sacred lineage from Woden, the god of
      war. It has been pretended, that this republic of kings was
      moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate. But such
      an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and
      turbulent spirit of the Saxons: their laws are silent; and their
      imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody prospect of
      intestine discord. 131

      Picts. (Hist. Eccles. l. ii. c. 5, p. 83.)]

      A monk, who, in the profound ignorance of human life, has
      presumed to exercise the office of historian, strangely
      disfigures the state of Britain at the time of its separation
      from the Western empire. Gildas 132 describes in florid language
      the improvements of agriculture, the foreign trade which flowed
      with every tide into the Thames and the Severn the solid and
      lofty construction of public and private edifices; he accuses the
      sinful luxury of the British people; of a people, according to
      the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and incapable,
      without the aid of the Romans, of providing walls of stone, or
      weapons of iron, for the defence of their native land. 133 Under
      the long dominion of the emperors, Britain had been insensibly
      moulded into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province,
      whose safety was intrusted to a foreign power. The subjects of
      Honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror;
      they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution;
      and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill, or courage, or
      authority, to direct the public force against the common enemy.
      The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakness,
      and degraded the character both of the prince and people. Their
      consternation magnified the danger; the want of union diminished
      their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more
      solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they
      imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries.

      Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of
      the manufacture or the use of arms; the successive and disorderly
      attacks of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their
      amazement, and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added
      discipline and experience to their native valor.

      503, 516) has smartly exposed this glaring absurdity, which had
      passed unnoticed by the general historians, as they were
      hastening to more interesting and important events]

      While the continent of Europe and Africa yielded, without
      resistance, to the Barbarians, the British island, alone and
      unaided, maintained a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful,
      struggle, against the formidable pirates, who, almost at the same
      instant, assaulted the Northern, the Eastern, and the Southern
      coasts. The cities which had been fortified with skill, were
      defended with resolution; the advantages of ground, hills,
      forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the
      inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with
      blood; and the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the
      discreet silence of their annalist. Hengist might hope to achieve
      the conquest of Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of
      thirty-five years, was confined to the possession of Kent; and
      the numerous colony which he had planted in the North, was
      extirpated by the sword of the Britons. The monarchy of the West
      Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of
      three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the bravest
      of the children of Woden, was consumed in the conquest of
      Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight; and the loss which he sustained
      in the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of
      inglorious repose. Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into
      Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at that time seated on a
      commanding eminence; and vanquished an army which advanced to the
      relief of the city. In the subsequent battle of Marlborough, 134
      his British enemies displayed their military science. Their
      troops were formed in three lines; each line consisted of three
      distinct bodies, and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen,
      were distributed according to the principles of Roman tactics.
      The Saxons charged in one weighty column, boldly encountered with
      their shord swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained
      an equal conflict till the approach of night. Two decisive
      victories, the death of three British kings, and the reduction of
      Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester, established the fame and power
      of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who carried his victorious
      arms to the banks of the Severn.

      Henry of Huntingdon (Scriptores pest Bedam, p. 314) relates the
      circumstances of this battle. They are probable and
      characteristic; and the historians of the twelfth century might
      consult some materials that no longer exist.] After a war of a
      hundred years, the independent Britons still occupied the whole
      extent of the Western coast, from the wall of Antoninus to the
      extreme promontory of Cornwall; and the principal cities of the
      inland country still opposed the arms of the Barbarians.
      Resistance became more languid, as the number and boldness of the
      assailants continually increased. Winning their way by slow and
      painful efforts, the Saxons, the Angles, and their various
      confederates, advanced from the North, from the East, and from
      the South, till their victorious banners were united in the
      centre of the island. Beyond the Severn the Britons still
      asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy,
      and even the monarchy, of the Saxons. The bravest warriors, who
      preferred exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the
      mountains of Wales: the reluctant submission of Cornwall was
      delayed for some ages; 135 and a band of fugitives acquired a
      settlement in Gaul, by their own valor, or the liberality of the
      Merovingian kings. 136 The Western angle of Armorica acquired the
      new appellations of Cornwall, and the Lesser Britain; and the
      vacant lands of the Osismii were filled by a strange people, who,
      under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved the
      laws and language of their ancestors. To the feeble descendants
      of Clovis and Charlemagne, the Britons of Armorica refused the
      customary tribute, subdued the neighboring dioceses of Vannes,
      Rennes, and Nantes, and formed a powerful, though vassal, state,
      which has been united to the crown of France. 137

      ii., in the Scriptores post Bedam, p. 50. The spirit of the

      481,) the army of Riothamus, and the loose declamation of Gildas,

      countenance an emigration as early as the middle of the fifth
      century. Beyond that era, the Britons of Armorica can be found
      only in romance; and I am surprised that Mr. Whitaker (Genuine

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part V.

      In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much
      courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence
      of Britain. Yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried
      in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however
      destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of
      blood and military renown. The tomb of Vortimer, the son of
      Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the sea-shore, as a
      landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished
      in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a
      noble family of Romans; 138 his modesty was equal to his valor,
      and his valor, till the last fatal action, 139 was crowned with
      splendid success. But every British name is effaced by the
      illustrious name of Arthur, 140 the hereditary prince of the
      Silures, in South Wales, and the elective king or general of the
      nation. According to the most rational account, he defeated, in
      twelve successive battles, the Angles of the North, and the
      Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the hero was
      imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. The
      events of his life are less interesting than the singular
      revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years
      the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely
      embellished, by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica, who were
      odious to the Saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind. The
      pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to
      inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they listened with
      fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the
      merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common
      enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of
      Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of
      the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent,
      ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or
      the fancy, of the twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian
      colony, from the Tyber to the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the
      fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived
      their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the
      Caesars. His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and
      Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged the recent
      injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition of the
      British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable
      institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully
      copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous
      exploits of Uther’s son appear less incredible than the
      adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the
      Normans. Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, introduced into Europe
      the specious miracles of Arabian magic. Fairies and giants,
      flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more
      simple fictions of the West; and the fate of Britain depended on
      the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation embraced and
      adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of the
      Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and
      the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were
      devoutly studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the
      genuine heroes and historians of antiquity. At length the light
      of science and reason was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the
      visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though
      unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the
      present age is inclined to question the existence of Arthur. 141

      Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the miseries of
      conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and
      destructive than in the hands of the Saxons; who hated the valor
      of their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated,
      without remorse, the most sacred objects of the Christian
      worship. The fields of battle might be traced, almost in every
      district, by monuments of bones; the fragments of falling towers
      were stained with blood; the last of the Britons, without
      distinction of age or sex, was massacred, 142 in the ruins of
      Anderida; 143 and the repetition of such calamities was frequent
      and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy. The arts and religion,
      the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted
      in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. After
      the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had
      declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics
      into Wales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left
      destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the
      remembrance, of Christianity were abolished; and the British
      clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the
      idolatrous strangers. The kings of France maintained the
      privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious Saxons
      trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The
      proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of
      honor, the forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the
      domestic rights of marriage, testament, and inheritance, were
      finally suppressed; and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and
      plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs, which
      had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of
      Germany. The language of science, of business, and of
      conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost
      in the general desolation. A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic
      words might be assumed by the Germans, to express their new wants
      and ideas; 144 but those illiterate Pagans preserved and
      established the use of their national dialect. 145 Almost every
      name, conspicuous either in the church or state, reveals its
      Teutonic origin; 146 and the geography of England was universally
      inscribed with foreign characters and appellations. The example
      of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may not easily be
      found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the arts of
      Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain;
      and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants
      was covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners.

      This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even
      philosophers, that the provincials of Britain were totally
      exterminated; and that the vacant land was again peopled by the
      perpetual influx, and rapid increase, of the German colonies.
      Three hundred thousand Saxons are said to have obeyed the summons
      of Hengist; 147 the entire emigation of the Angles was attested,
      in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native country; 148
      and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human
      race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their
      steps are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful. The
      Saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and
      cultivation; the towns were small, the villages were distant; the
      husbandry was languid and unskilful; four sheep were equivalent
      to an acre of the best land; 149 an ample space of wood and
      morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature; and the
      modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the Tyne to
      the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage and
      solitary forest. 150 Such imperfect population might have been
      supplied, in some generations, by the English colonies; but
      neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition,
      that the Saxons of Britain remained alone in the desert which
      they had subdued. After the sanguinary Barbarians had secured
      their dominion, and gratified their revenge, it was their
      interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle, of the
      unresisting country. In each successive revolution, the patient
      herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the salutary
      compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual
      necessities. Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, 151 accepted from
      his royal convert the gift of the peninsula of Selsey, near
      Chichester, with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who
      then amounted to eighty-seven families. He released them at once
      from spiritual and temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty
      slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master. The
      kingdom of Sussex, which spread from the sea to the Thames,
      contained seven thousand families; twelve hundred were ascribed
      to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this vague computation,
      it may seem probable, that England was cultivated by a million of
      servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of their
      arbitrary landlords. The indigent Barbarians were often tempted
      to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even
      foreign, bondage; 152 yet the special exemptions which were
      granted to national slaves, 153 sufficiently declare that they
      were much less numerous than the strangers and captives, who had
      lost their liberty, or changed their masters, by the accidents of
      war. When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of
      the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged the frequent practice of
      manumission; and their subjects, of Welsh or Cambrian extraction,
      assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen, possessed of
      lands, and entitled to the rights of civil society. 154 Such
      gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people,
      who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales and
      Cornwall. The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the two
      nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four British lords
      of Somersetshire may be honorably distinguished in the court of a
      Saxon monarch. 155

      The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of
      original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly
      reclaimed. Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind,
      they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the
      Catholic world. 156 Christianity was still professed in the
      mountains of Wales; but the rude schismatics, in the form of the
      clerical tonsure, and in the day of the celebration of Easter,
      obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the Roman
      pontiffs. The use of the Latin language was insensibly abolished,
      and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which Italy
      communicated to her Saxon proselytes. In Wales and Armorica, the
      Celtic tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and
      propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the
      Druids, were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the
      laws of Elizabeth. Their chief, a respectable officer of the
      courts of Pengwern, or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the
      king’s servants to war: the monarchy of the Britons, which he
      sung in the front of battle, excited their courage, and justified
      their depredations; and the songster claimed for his legitimate
      prize the fairest heifer of the spoil. His subordinate ministers,
      the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music,
      visited, in their respective circuits, the royal, the noble, and
      the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost exhausted by
      the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the
      bards. Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials,
      and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the
      fancy of the poet, and of his audience. 157 The last retreats of
      Celtic freedom, the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain, were
      less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the
      Britons consisted in their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were
      their ordinary food; and bread was sometimes esteemed, or
      rejected, as a foreign luxury. Liberty had peopled the mountains
      of Wales and the morasses of Armorica; but their populousness has
      been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy; and
      the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to
      contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. 158 Their
      disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and
      in speech; 159 and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace,
      they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic
      war. The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the
      archers of Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty
      could seldom procure either shields or helmets; and the
      inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of
      their desultory operations. One of the greatest of the English
      monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a Greek
      emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry II. could
      assert, from his personal experience, that Wales was inhabited by
      a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the
      defensive armor of their enemies. 160

      By the revolution of Britain, the limits of science, as well as
      of empire, were contracted. The dark cloud, which had been
      cleared by the Phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by
      the arms of Caesar, again settled on the shores of the Atlantic,
      and a Roman province was again lost among the fabulous Islands of
      the Ocean. One hundred and fifty years after the reign of
      Honorius, the gravest historian of the times 161 describes the
      wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and western parts are
      divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life and death, or,
      more properly, of truth and fiction. The east is a fair country,
      inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters
      are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and
      fruitful increase. In the west, beyond the wall, the air is
      infectious and mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and
      this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits, who are
      transported from the opposite shores in substantial boats, and by
      living rowers. Some families of fishermen, the subjects of the
      Franks, are excused from tribute, in consideration of the
      mysterious office which is performed by these Charons of the
      ocean. Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of midnight, to
      hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is
      sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an
      unknown, but irresistible power. After this dream of fancy, we
      read with astonishment, that the name of this island is Brittia;
      that it lies in the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and
      less than thirty miles from the continent; that it is possessed
      by three nations, the Frisians, the Angles, and the Britons; and
      that some Angles had appeared at Constantinople, in the train of
      the French ambassadors. From these ambassadors Procopius might be
      informed of a singular, though not improbable, adventure, which
      announces the spirit, rather than the delicacy, of an English
      heroine. She had been betrothed to Radiger, king of the Varni, a
      tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine; but the
      perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer his
      father’s widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks. 162
      The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing,
      revenged her disgrace. Her warlike subjects are said to have been
      ignorant of the use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she
      boldly sailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a
      fleet of four hundred ships, and an army of one hundred thousand
      men. After the loss of a battle, the captive Radiger implored the
      mercy of his victorious bride, who generously pardoned his
      offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the king of the Varni
      to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of a husband. 163
      This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of
      the Anglo-Saxons. The arts of navigation, by which they acquired
      the empire of Britain and of the sea, were soon neglected by the
      indolent Barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial
      advantages of their insular situation. Seven independent kingdoms
      were agitated by perpetual discord; and the British world was
      seldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the
      Continent. 164

      retired to Sens, where she founded monasteries, and distributed

      and fall of the Roman empire, from the fortunate age of Trajan
      and the Antonines, to its total extinction in the West, about
      five centuries after the Christian era. At that unhappy period,
      the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession
      of Britain: Gaul and Spain were divided between the powerful
      monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths, and the dependent
      kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians: Africa was exposed to the
      cruel persecution of the Vandals, and the savage insults of the
      Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were
      afflicted by an army of Barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless
      tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth.
      All the subjects of the empire, who, by the use of the Latin
      language, more particularly deserved the name and privileges of
      Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign
      conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany established a new
      system of manners and government in the western countries of
      Europe. The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by the
      princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of
      Augustus. Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the
      Danube to the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of
      Italy and Africa were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the
      history of the Greek emperors may still afford a long series of
      instructive lessons, and interesting revolutions.




      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part VI.

    General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.

      The Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,
      imputed the triumphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the
      fortune, of the republic. The inconstant goddess, who so blindly
      distributes and resumes her favors, had now consented (such was
      the language of envious flattery) to resign her wings, to descend
      from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the
      banks of the Tyber. 1000 A wiser Greek, who has composed, with a
      philosophic spirit, the memorable history of his own times,
      deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort, by
      opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of
      Rome. 2000 The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the
      state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the
      prejudices of religion. Honor, as well as virtue, was the
      principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens labored to
      deserve the solemn glories of a triumph; and the ardor of the
      Roman youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they
      beheld the domestic images of their ancestors. 3000 The temperate
      struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established
      the firm and equal balance of the constitution; which united the
      freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and wisdom of a
      senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When the
      consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound
      himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the
      cause of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a
      military service of ten years. This wise institution continually
      poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and
      soldiers; and their numbers were reenforced by the warlike and
      populous states of Italy, who, after a brave resistance, had
      yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance, of the Romans.
      The sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio,
      and beheld the ruin of Carthage, 4000 has accurately described
      their military system; their levies, arms, exercises,
      subordination, marches, encampments; and the invincible legion,
      superior in active strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip
      and Alexander. From these institutions of peace and war Polybius
      has deduced the spirit and success of a people, incapable of
      fear, and impatient of repose. The ambitious design of conquest,
      which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of
      mankind, was attempted and achieved; and the perpetual violation
      of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence
      and courage. The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in
      battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to
      the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the
      images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to
      represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken
      by the iron monarchy of Rome. 5000

      in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes, aliarum
      gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus, (Opera, tom. v. p. 572.)]

      The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as
      a singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the
      decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of
      immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay;
      the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest;
      and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial
      supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its
      own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and
      instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we
      should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The
      victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of
      strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the
      republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The
      emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,
      were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline
      which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to
      the enemy; the vigor of the military government was relaxed, and
      finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine;
      and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

      The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation
      of the seat of empire; but this History has already shown, that
      the powers of government were divided, rather than removed. The
      throne of Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West
      was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their
      residence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the
      legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the
      strength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the
      instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were
      multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was
      introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of
      Theodosius. Extreme distress, which unites the virtue of a free
      people, imbitters the factions of a declining monarchy. The
      hostile favorites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic
      to its common enemies; and the Byzantine court beheld with
      indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace of Rome, the
      misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the
      succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored;
      but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and
      ineffectual; and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was
      enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of
      interests, and even of religion. Yet the salutary event approved
      in some measure the judgment of Constantine. During a long period
      of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of
      Barbarians, protected the wealth of Asia, and commanded, both in
      peace and war, the important straits which connect the Euxine and
      Mediterranean Seas. The foundation of Constantinople more
      essentially contributed to the preservation of the East, than to
      the ruin of the West.

      As the happiness of a future life is the great object of
      religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal, that the
      introduction or at least the abuse, of Christianity had some
      influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy
      successfully preached the doctrines of patience and
      pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were discouraged;
      and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the
      cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was
      consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and
      the soldiers’ pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both
      sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and
      chastity. 511 Faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly
      passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological
      discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by
      religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody, and
      always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted
      from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new
      species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret
      enemies of their country. Yet party spirit, however pernicious or
      absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The
      bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of
      passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their
      frequent assemblies, and perpetual correspondence, maintained the
      communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the
      gospel was strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual
      alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was
      devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if
      superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices
      would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser
      motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are
      easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural
      inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine
      influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though
      imperfect, effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the North. If
      the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of
      Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the
      fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.

      511 (return) [ It might be a curious speculation, how far the
      purer morals of the genuine and more active Christians may have
      compensated, in the population of the Roman empire, for the
      secession of such numbers into inactive and unproductive
      celibacy.—M.]

      This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction
      of the present age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and
      promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country:
      but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to
      consider Europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants
      have obtained almost the same level of politeness and
      cultivation. The balance of power will continue to fluctuate, and
      the prosperity of our own, or the neighboring kingdoms, may be
      alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial events cannot
      essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of
      arts, and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish,
      above the rest of mankind, the Europeans and their colonies. The
      savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized
      society; and we may inquire, with anxious curiosity, whether
      Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities,
      which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome.
      Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that
      mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our actual
      security.

      I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and
      the number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the
      Northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with
      innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and
      turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of
      industry. The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse
      of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant
      revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a victorious
      enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent was
      swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The
      flying tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the
      spirit of conquest; the endless column of Barbarians pressed on
      the Roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost
      were destroyed, the vacant space was instantly replenished by new
      assailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from
      the North; and the long repose, which has been imputed to the
      decrease of population, is the happy consequence of the progress
      of arts and agriculture. Instead of some rude villages, thinly
      scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany now produces a
      list of two thousand three hundred walled towns: the Christian
      kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland, have been successively
      established; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic knights,
      have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic, as
      far as the Gulf of Finland. From the Gulf of Finland to the
      Eastern Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and
      civilized empire. The plough, the loom, and the forge, are
      introduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and
      the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and
      obey. The reign of independent Barbarism is now contracted to a
      narrow span; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks, whose forces
      may be almost numbered, cannot seriously excite the apprehensions
      of the great republic of Europe. 6000 Yet this apparent security
      should not tempt us to forget, that new enemies, and unknown
      dangers, may possibly arise from some obscure people, scarcely
      visible in the map of the world, The Arabs or Saracens, who
      spread their conquests from India to Spain, had languished in
      poverty and contempt, till Mahomet breathed into those savage
      bodies the soul of enthusiasm.

      6000 (return) [ The French and English editors of the
      Genealogical History of the Tartars have subjoined a curious,
      though imperfect, description, of their present state. We might
      question the independence of the Calmucks, or Eluths, since they
      have been recently vanquished by the Chinese, who, in the year
      1759, subdued the Lesser Bucharia, and advanced into the country
      of Badakshan, near the source of the Oxus, (Mémoires sur les
      Chinois, tom. i. p. 325-400.) But these conquests are precarious,
      nor will I venture to insure the safety of the Chinese empire.]

      II. The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and
      perfect coalition of its members. The subject nations, resigning
      the hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the
      character of Roman citizens; and the provinces of the West were
      reluctantly torn by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother
      country. 7000 But this union was purchased by the loss of
      national freedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces,
      destitute of life and motion, expected their safety from the
      mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders
      of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millions depended
      on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose
      minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power.
      The deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the
      minorities of the sons and grandsons of Theodosius; and, after
      those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood, they
      abandoned the church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs,
      and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into
      twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three respectable
      commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,
      states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are
      multiplied, at least, with the number of its rulers; and a
      Julian, or Semiramis, may reign in the North, while Arcadius and
      Honorius again slumber on the thrones of the South. The abuses of
      tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame;
      republics have acquired order and stability; monarchies have
      imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at least, of moderation;
      and some sense of honor and justice is introduced into the most
      defective constitutions by the general manners of the times. In
      peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by
      the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European
      forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a
      savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he
      must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the
      numerous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the
      intrepid freemen of Britain; who, perhaps, might confederate for
      their common defence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry
      slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean, ten thousand
      vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of
      civilized society; and Europe would revive and flourish in the
      American world, which is already filled with her colonies and
      institutions. 8000

      7000 (return) [ The prudent reader will determine how far this
      general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians,
      the independence of Britain and Armorica, the Moorish tribes, or
      the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain, (vol. i. p. 328, vol. iii. p.
      315, vol. iii. p. 372, 480.)]

      8000 (return) [ America now contains about six millions of
      European blood and descent; and their numbers, at least in the
      North, are continually increasing. Whatever may be the changes of
      their political situation, they must preserve the manners of
      Europe; and we may reflect with some pleasure, that the English
      language will probably be diffused ever an immense and populous
      continent.]

      III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the
      strength and courage of Barbarians. In every age they have
      oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and
      Persia, who neglected, and still neglect, to counterbalance these
      natural powers by the resources of military art. The warlike
      states of antiquity, Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race
      of soldiers; exercised their bodies, disciplined their courage,
      multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the
      iron, which they possessed, into strong and serviceable weapons.
      But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and
      manners; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successors
      armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valor
      of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed
      by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the
      two most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathematics,
      chemistry, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the
      service of war; and the adverse parties oppose to each other the
      most elaborate modes of attack and of defence. Historians may
      indignantly observe, that the preparations of a siege would found
      and maintain a flourishing colony; 9000 yet we cannot be
      displeased, that the subversion of a city should be a work of
      cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be
      protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of
      military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an
      impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse; and Europe is
      secure from any future irruptions of Barbarians; since, before
      they can conquer, they must cease to be barbarous. Their gradual
      advances in the science of war would always be accompanied, as we
      may learn from the example of Russia, with a proportionable
      improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they
      themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom
      they subdue.

      Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there
      still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. The
      discoveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the domestic
      history, or tradition, of the most enlightened nations, represent
      the human savage, naked both in body and mind and destitute of
      laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost of language. 1001 From this
      abject condition, perhaps the primitive and universal state of
      man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals, to fertilize
      the earth, to traverse the ocean and to measure the heavens. His
      progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and
      corporeal faculties 1101 has been irregular and various;
      infinitely slow in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with
      redoubled velocity: ages of laborious ascent have been followed
      by a moment of rapid downfall; and the several climates of the
      globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet the
      experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes, and
      diminish our apprehensions: we cannot determine to what height
      the human species may aspire in their advances towards
      perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no people, unless
      the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their original
      barbarism. The improvements of society may be viewed under a
      threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age
      and country by the efforts of a single mind; but those superior
      powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions;
      and the genius of Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite less
      admiration, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or
      the lessons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of
      trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences, are more solid and
      permanent: and many individuals may be qualified, by education
      and discipline, to promote, in their respective stations, the
      interest of the community. But this general order is the effect
      of skill and labor; and the complex machinery may be decayed by
      time, or injured by violence.

      3. Fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more
      necessary arts, can be performed without superior talents, or
      national subordination: without the powers of one, or the union
      of many. Each village, each family, each individual, must always
      possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of
      fire 1201 and of metals; the propagation and service of domestic
      animals; the methods of hunting and fishing; the rudiments of
      navigation; the imperfect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive
      grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic trades. Private
      genius and public industry may be extirpated; but these hardy
      plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into
      the most unfavorable soil. The splendid days of Augustus and
      Trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians
      subverted the laws and palaces of Rome. But the scythe, the
      invention or emblem of Saturn, 1302 still continued annually to
      mow the harvests of Italy; and the human feasts of the
      Laestrigons 1401 have never been renewed on the coast of
      Campania.

      Homer has embellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors,

      Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and
      religious zeal have diffused, among the savages of the Old and
      New World, these inestimable gifts: they have been successively
      propagated; they can never be lost. We may therefore acquiesce in
      the pleasing conclusion, that every age of the world has
      increased, and still increases, the real wealth, the happiness,
      the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race. 1501

      A singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and
      country. The five great voyages, successively undertaken by the
      command of his present Majesty, were inspired by the pure and
      generous love of science and of mankind. The same prince,
      adapting his benefactions to the different stages of society, has
      founded his school of painting in his capital; and has introduced
      into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and animals most
      useful to human life.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
