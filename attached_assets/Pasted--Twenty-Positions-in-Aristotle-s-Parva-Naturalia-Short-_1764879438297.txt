**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Parva Naturalia* (Short Treatises on Natural Philosophy)**

1. The *Parva Naturalia* treats phenomena **common to soul and body**—states that involve psychic capacities but depend essentially on bodily conditions.

2. **Sense and Sensibilia**: The sensible qualities (colors, sounds, odors, flavors, tangible qualities) are objective features of bodies, not mere subjective affections.

3. **Color** is the visible quality of what is visible in itself; it is located at the surface of bodies and requires a transparent medium (light) for perception.

4. The number of basic colors is **finite and determinate**—intermediate colors arise from mixture of extremes (white and black).

5. **On Memory**: Memory is the **possession of an image as a likeness of that of which it is an image**—it involves a representational reference to the past.

6. Memory belongs to the **same part of the soul as imagination**—it requires phantasmata (mental images).

7. **Memory is essentially of the past**—one cannot remember present perceptions or future expectations; memory intrinsically involves temporal distance.

8. **Recollection (anamnesis)** differs from memory—it is an active search, a quasi-inferential recovery of what was known, moving through associated images.

9. Recollection proceeds by **association**: similarity, contrariety, and contiguity guide the search through the sequence of phantasmata.

10. **On Sleep and Waking**: Sleep is a natural state involving the **incapacitation of the primary sense organ**—the heart in Aristotle's physiology.

11. Sleep results from **evaporation of nutriment**—warm vapors rise to the head, cool, and descend, causing loss of perceptual awareness.

12. Sleep is **for the sake of preservation**—it rests the sense organs and restores the animal's capacity for waking activity.

13. **On Dreams**: Dreams are **movements of phantasia occurring during sleep**—residual motions from waking perception that persist and become vivid when external sensation ceases.

14. Dreams are **not divine prophecies**—they are natural phenomena explicable by the mechanics of sense-imagery.

15. Some dreams may coincidentally match future events by **chance**, or the dream may serve as a **starting point** that influences subsequent action, or the dreamer may perceive **subtle bodily signs** that portend illness.

16. **On Divination in Sleep**: Most apparently prophetic dreams are coincidences; true divine dreams would require explaining why the gods send them to ordinary people rather than the wise.

17. **On Length and Shortness of Life**: Longevity correlates with the **balance and quality of the organism's vital heat and moisture**—different species have different natural lifespans.

18. **On Youth and Old Age, Life and Death**: Life depends on **innate heat centered in the heart**; death occurs when this heat is exhausted or extinguished.

19. **On Respiration**: Breathing serves to **cool the vital heat**—animals that breathe maintain their heat within viable limits through this refrigeration.

20. All these phenomena reveal the **intimate union of soul and body**—psychic activities are realized in and through physiological processes; studying one requires studying the other.
