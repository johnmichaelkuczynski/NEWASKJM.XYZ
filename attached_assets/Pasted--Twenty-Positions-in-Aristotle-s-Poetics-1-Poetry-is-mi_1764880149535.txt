**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Poetics***

1. **Poetry is mimesis (imitation/representation)**—all poetic arts imitate human action, character, and emotion through different media, objects, and modes.

2. The species of poetry differ by **medium** (rhythm, language, melody), **object** (better, worse, or similar characters), and **mode** (narrative, dramatic, or mixed).

3. **Mimesis is natural to humans**—we are the most imitative of animals, we learn through imitation, and we take pleasure in representations even of painful things.

4. **Tragedy** is the imitation of a serious, complete action of magnitude, in embellished language, through enacted drama, accomplishing catharsis of pity and fear.

5. Tragedy has **six elements**: plot (mythos), character (ēthos), thought (dianoia), diction (lexis), melody (melos), and spectacle (opsis)—ranked in that order of importance.

6. **Plot is the soul of tragedy**—it is the arrangement of incidents; tragedy is primarily imitation of action, not of persons.

7. A good plot must be **whole and complete**—having a beginning, middle, and end, with parts connected by necessity or probability.

8. The plot must have **proper magnitude**—long enough to allow the change of fortune, short enough to be grasped as a unity.

9. **Unity of plot** is not unity of hero—a plot is one when it imitates one complete action; episodic plots that lack necessary connection are inferior.

10. Poetry is **more philosophical than history**—history tells what happened, poetry what could happen; poetry expresses universals, history particulars.

11. The best plots involve **reversal (peripeteia)** and **recognition (anagnorisis)**—the change from ignorance to knowledge, ideally coinciding with the reversal of fortune.

12. The **complex plot** combining reversal and recognition is superior to the simple plot—it produces the characteristic tragic pleasure most effectively.

13. The ideal tragic hero is **neither perfectly virtuous nor villainous**—a person of high standing who falls through some **hamartia (error/flaw)**, not vice.

14. The change should be from **good fortune to bad**—plots ending in prosperity are less tragic; the downfall of the good-but-flawed evokes pity and fear.

15. **Pity** is aroused by undeserved misfortune; **fear** by misfortune befalling someone like ourselves—together they produce catharsis.

16. **Catharsis** is the clarification or purgation of pity and fear—tragedy's emotional effect is beneficial, not corrupting. (The term's precise meaning remains debated.)

17. **Character (ēthos)** must be good, appropriate, like reality, and consistent—characters should act according to necessity or probability given who they are.

18. The **dénouement** should arise from the plot itself—not from the deus ex machina; resolution must follow from prior action.

19. **Epic** shares many features with tragedy but differs in length, meter (hexameter), and narrative mode—it permits greater scale and multiple simultaneous actions.

20. Tragedy is **superior to epic**—it achieves its end in shorter compass, has greater unity, and adds the powerful resources of music and spectacle to poetic imitation.
