NIGHTMARE CONVERSION WORKFLOW

USER INPUT: Non-fiction text (with optional gender preference and customizations)
OUTPUT: Nightmare story where author's deepest fear materializes, using existing story template

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE ANXIETY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Analyze the non-fiction to identify:
- What is the author defending against through this intellectual work?
- What would be their worst-case realistic scenario?
- What does the defensive structure reveal about their fear?

Output: One-sentence statement of core anxiety

Example: "Author fears being exposed as intellectual fraud whose abstract philosophy masks lack of substance"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 2: SELECT STORY TEMPLATE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From the 333+ template library, choose based on:

A. STRUCTURAL FIT (most important)
- Which template's arc matches the anxiety structure?
- Paranoid exposure → "The Tell-Tale Heart," Kafka, "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"
- Double life collapse → Ted Bundy template, Jekyll/Hyde, Gone Girl
- System crushing individual → Kafka bureaucratic, 1984, "The Obsolete Man"
- Narcissistic denial → Fatal Vision/Jeffrey MacDonald, Amadeus (Salieri)
- Trusted insider betrayal → Aldrich Ames, "The Conversation"
- Idealism destroyed → Into the Wild, "Young Goodman Brown"
- Cannot process experience → The Emperor's Club, Shutter Island
- House of cards → Enron, Madoff, FTX, LTCM

B. GENDER PREFERENCE (if specified by user)
- Boy-lit templates for male-oriented output
- Girl-lit templates for female-oriented output
- Neutral if unspecified

C. GENRE APPROPRIATENESS
- Academic fraud → noir detective, psychological horror, or true crime fraud
- Political persecution → Greek tragedy, dystopia, or espionage
- Social ostracism → Chekhov slice-of-life, Kafka bureaucratic
- Professional collapse → true crime financial, rise-and-fall films

Output: Specific template choice with brief justification

Example: "Using 'The Tell-Tale Heart' structure - paranoid first-person, building dread, inevitable self-exposure"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 3: MAP NIGHTMARE TO TEMPLATE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Identify key structural beats of chosen template
- Map author's specific nightmare onto those beats
- Ensure nightmare WINS (fear materializes, protagonist destroyed/defeated)
- Integrate any background facts naturally into narrative (no separate sections)

Example mapping for "Tell-Tale Heart":
- Opening: Narrator insists on sanity while revealing obsession
- Rising action: Detailed planning, false confidence
- Crisis: The deed is done but guilt/paranoia grows
- Climax: The sound (symbolic guilt) becomes unbearable  
- Resolution: Confession/self-exposure under pressure

Applied to academic fraud nightmare:
- Opening: Professor insists his work is rigorous while showing defensive tells
- Rising action: Building reputation on hollow abstractions, near-misses
- Crisis: Major presentation where emptiness becomes undeniable
- Climax: Questions expose the void, psychological pressure mounts
- Resolution: Public breakdown/exposure or forced confession

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 4: WRITE IN TEMPLATE'S STYLE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Match the chosen template's:
- Narrative voice (1st person paranoid vs 3rd person documentary vs 2nd person dissolution)
- Sentence rhythms and pacing
- Level of interiority vs external observation
- Tone (dread, matter-of-fact, ironic, tragic, etc.)
- Typical scene construction and transitions

Examples:
- Poe → Paranoid first-person, building dread, obsessive detail
- Kafka → Matter-of-fact bureaucratic horror, understated
- Chekhov → Understated tragedy, everyday details, no melodrama
- True crime → Documentary realism, specific dates/facts, accumulating evidence
- Twilight Zone → Ironic setup, twist revelation, moral sting
- Greek tragedy → Inexorable fate, recognition too late, cosmic weight

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 5: INCORPORATE USER CUSTOMIZATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If user specified details (names, locations, professions):
- Integrate naturally into the story world
- Don't force if they break template logic
- Make them feel organic to the narrative

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 6: VERIFY NIGHTMARE STRUCTURE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CRITICAL CHECK: Does the fear WIN?

❌ WRONG: Hero overcomes anxiety, vindication, happy ending
❌ WRONG: Ambiguous ending, hope remains
✅ CORRECT: Fear materializes fully, protagonist destroyed/defeated
✅ CORRECT: Recognition comes too late, damage done
✅ CORRECT: System wins, individual crushed
✅ CORRECT: Exposure happens, reputation destroyed
✅ CORRECT: Cannot escape fate, prophecy fulfilled

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The LLM should provide:

1. TEMPLATE SELECTION (brief, for internal processing - not shown to user unless asked)
"Using: 'The Tell-Tale Heart' - paranoid first-person exposure narrative"

2. THE STORY (complete, integrated, no sections)
- Single flowing narrative
- Background/facts woven in naturally

EXAMPLE 1: RAWLS CRITIQUE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER INPUT (Complete text):

"According to Rawls, a just society is one that one would choose to belong to if one knew nothing as to what one's position in that society would be and if one knew nothing as to one's gender, ethnicity, intelligence-level, or other such status-relevant parameters. Such a society would be a squalid bureaucratic wasteland, similar to the Soviet Union, and its entire structure would be a weapon for the mediocre to hold back the gifted, with the result that people as a whole, including the mediocre, would be prevented from flourishing. There is obviously a sense in which the social contract described by Rawls is "fair", but there is no meaningful sense in which the resulting society would be just. Moreover, since a Rawlsian society would quickly degenerate into a condition of bureaucratic tyranny, in which everybody oppressed everybody, it would be irrelevant that its inception occurred in a "fair" way. Several vigorous attempts to create and run societies along Rawlsian lines have been implemented, and they all failed utterly, showing how wrong Rawls' analysis is."

STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE ANXIETY

Core Anxiety Statement:
"Author fears being trapped in an egalitarian system that systematically suppresses excellence and destroys merit, where escape is impossible and the gifted are punished for their abilities."

STEP 2: SELECT STORY TEMPLATE

Template Selected: "The Obsolete Man" (Twilight Zone)

Why: Individual deemed socially harmful by bureaucratic state, judged, sentenced, destroyed with no escape. Perfect match for "system crushes excellence" anxiety.

STEP 3: THE STORY OUTPUT

**Case #2847: Social Equity Violation**

Dr. James Kensington stood before the three-member tribunal in the windowless room. Director Chen opened his file without looking up.

"Dr. Kensington. Quantum physicist. Published seventeen papers in the last three years." She paused. "Do you know why you're here?"

"No."

"Your work creates hierarchical knowledge structures. In January, you published findings that fewer than sixty people globally can comprehend. In March, you declined collaboration with Regional Collective #7, stating they 'lacked mathematical foundations' for your research. In April, you solved in two days what your assigned team had worked on for six months."

"I was trying to help—"

"You demonstrated superiority," Administrator Voss interrupted from Chen's left. "Superiority creates inequality. Inequality creates suffering. You've been reported by fourteen colleagues for 'making them feel inadequate.'"

Kensington's pulse accelerated. "Should I have pretended not to understand?"

"You should have raised the collective capacity rather than highlighting individual excellence," Chen said. "The Fairness Accords of 2028 established that capability differences cause social harm. Your abilities harm others by comparison."

"This is insane."

Commissioner Park, on Chen's right, spoke for the first time. "Dr. Kensington, why do you believe your individual achievements matter more than collective wellbeing?"

"Because individual excellence lifts everyone. My research could—"

"Could create more inequality. More feelings of inadequacy. More social destabilization." Park shook her head. "We learned from the failures of hierarchical societies. Excellence was simply another word for oppression."

Chen closed the folder. "You have two options. Cognitive Realignment: twelve months where you'll learn to operate within community median capabilities. Or Settlement #7—permanent relocation with other equity resisters. No technology above 1950s level. No communication with fairness zones."

"And if I refuse both?"

"Refusal isn't available to you."

Kensington looked at the three faces. Calm. Certain. The logic was perfect within their system: eliminate capability differences, eliminate suffering caused by comparison. They weren't evil. They'd simply built a society where excellence was a crime.

"Settlement #7," he said.

"Expected," Voss noted. "Resisters prefer isolation. This confirms the psychological profile."

Chen pressed a button. Two attendants entered. "Process for transfer. Remove research credentials. Reassign his publications to Collective Archive under general authorship."

As they led him out, Park added: "This isn't punishment, Dr. Kensington. We're protecting society from the harm your gifts would cause."

He turned. "What about the harm your system causes?"

"We've eliminated comparison," Chen replied. "Without comparison, there's no suffering. Without suffering, there's justice."

The door closed.

Four months later, Kensington sat in the Settlement #7 compound watching rain through a plastic window. Fifty-three exiles—scientists, artists, two concert pianists whose hands now worked farming equipment. They'd tried to continue their work at first. But without resources, equipment, or even basic paper beyond rations, their gifts atrophied.

Last week, Dr. Elena Vasquez—Fields Medal winner—stopped speaking. She spent her days arranging rocks by size. Some defense mechanism, Kensington thought. Or just final recognition that this was permanent.

The compound radio announced the Equity Board had exceeded targets. Social destabilization incidents down forty percent. Citizen satisfaction—carefully adjusted for removal of destabilizing elements—at record highs.

Kensington looked at his hands. Still capable, technically. But capable of nothing. The system didn't need to kill excellence. It only needed to remove conditions in which excellence could exist.

This wasn't punishment, Chen had said.

It was extinction through perfect administration.

EXAMPLE 2: DISSERTATION ABSTRACT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER INPUT (Complete text):

"In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell's minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the "Myth of the Mental." I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content."

STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE ANXIETY

Core Anxiety Statement:
"Author fears being exposed at dissertation defense as having spent years demolishing the very position he claims to defend, with the committee recognizing the contradiction between his analysis (everything is problematic/dubious/undermined) and his conclusion (but it's attractive anyway)."

STEP 2: SELECT STORY TEMPLATE

Template Selected: "The Tell-Tale Heart" (Edgar Allan Poe)

Why: Paranoid first-person narrator insisting on soundness while elaborately revealing guilt through defensive over-explanation. The very thoroughness of the defense becomes proof of the crime. The dissertation's structure IS the tell-tale heart.

STEP 3: THE STORY OUTPUT

**Defense**

True!—I am nervous—very nervous, but why will you say that I am unsound? The dissertation is rigorous. Four years of systematic analysis. Two hundred and eighty-seven pages. Every objection examined. Can you call a man unsound whose methodology is so thorough?

Listen. Let me show you how carefully I proceeded.

First: seventy-three pages establishing McDowell's minimal empiricism in exhaustive detail. Professor Harkins wrote "masterful" in the margin of page forty-seven. I still have that draft. I look at it sometimes when the doubt comes.

Second: forty-one pages demonstrating that Gaskin's critiques are faulty. His minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Very dubious! I proved this through twelve distinct arguments. Twelve! Can you imagine such thoroughness proceeding from an unsound mind?

Third—and here is where lesser scholars would have stopped—I scrutinized McDowell's own credentials. I showed his linguistic idealism is problematic. I engaged Dreyfus's phenomenological critique. I demonstrated—conclusively—that Dreyfus's accusation of "Myth of the Mental" is correct. Correct! This means McDowell's direct realism is problematic.

Fourth: one hundred and seventeen pages on Burge's critique of disjunctivism. I proved Burge successfully undermines it. And disjunctivism—as I carefully documented—is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Crucial!

Now. Having established all this—you see how methodically I worked—I concluded that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.

There. Perfectly sound.

My defense is April 15th. Three weeks. I've prepared seventeen versions of my opening statement. Professor Harkins will be there. Professor Chen. And the external examiner from MIT, Professor Brennan—she published that paper on disjunctivism I cited. The one that... but I've prepared for every question.

At night I rehearse. I face the empty chairs. "First, I establish McDowell's framework." But my hands shake. Why should they shake? Two hundred and eighty-seven pages cannot be unsound.

Last week I reread the conclusion. The final paragraph: "While minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content, and while McDowell's direct realism is problematic, and while Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious, and while Burge successfully undermines disjunctivism which is crucial for transcendental empiricism, nevertheless transcendental empiricism remains an attractive alternative."

I sat in my office for an hour. The building was empty. I could hear the fluorescent lights humming. A sound like a heartbeat. Steady. Relentless.

Professor Harkins emailed yesterday. "Looking forward to your defense. I'm sure the committee will have questions about your conclusion." Questions about my conclusion! The conclusion follows necessarily from the analysis. Necessarily!

My colleague Marcus read it two weeks ago. His face was strange when he returned it. "Very thorough," he said. "Really comprehensive demolition of the position." Demolition! Why that word? "Did Harkins approve this version of the conclusion?"

Why wouldn't he approve? The conclusion is perfectly consistent with—but it is! Because attractive does not mean correct. I explain this in footnote 347. Page 281. Eleven hundred words distinguishing eight senses of "attractive." Eight senses! This is thoroughness, not—

Not what?

I wake at 3 AM now. Last night I opened the file. The cursor blinked at the end. In the dark I heard it again—that sound. Like the lights. Like a heartbeat. The sound of something that knows.

I added another paragraph. Eight hundred words explaining "attractive" means systematic elegance rather than truth-functional adequacy. Now the conclusion is six pages. Surely that demonstrates seriousness.

Professor Brennan emailed this morning. "Excellent scholarship. I have questions for the defense regarding the relationship between your analysis in chapters 2-5 and your conclusions in chapter 6."

The relationship! There is a relationship! After analyzing, one concludes. After examining evidence, one judges. Basic philosophical methodology!

I wrote back immediately. Attached a seventeen-page addendum clarifying "attractive alternative." I can provide additional argumentation during defense. Additional! As though two hundred and eighty-seven pages were insufficient!

The sound is louder now. I hear it in my office. In the library. In the hallways. That steady rhythm. The sound of two hundred and eighty-seven pages of careful argumentation proving exactly what I claim it doesn't prove.

I've timed how long I can explain the conclusion without my voice wavering. This morning: four minutes thirty-seven seconds. Yesterday: five minutes twelve seconds. I'm getting worse.

Last night I dreamed I was at the defense. Harkins asked me to explain the conclusion. I opened my mouth and what came out was not words but that sound. That heartbeat. Louder and louder. And everyone could hear it. They had always heard it. The sound coming from the dissertation itself, from the space between the analysis and the conclusion, from where the contradiction lived and breathed and waited.

I woke at 3 AM standing at my desk. The dissertation open. I don't remember getting out of bed.

Today is April 14th. Tomorrow is the defense. Navy suit laid out. Blue tie. Professional. Sound.

All seventeen opening statements memorized. I'll choose based on the committee's demeanor. This is good planning, not panic. Why would anyone say panic?

But who would say it? Why am I defending against accusations no one has made?

11 PM. Defense in ten hours. I should sleep. Instead I'm adding footnote 348 to page 281. It will explain the methodological distinction between systematic analysis and final evaluation. It will make everything clear.

The sound is so loud now. Like it's coming from inside the laptop. From the heart of the argument. Two hundred and eighty-seven pages of demolition cannot be followed by "nevertheless attractive alternative." Cannot be. The words contradict in their structure. And tomorrow they will all see it.

2 AM. I write to Harkins: "I need to withdraw. I need to revise the conclusion. I need—" But I don't send it. Withdrawal means admitting four years built on a contradiction I couldn't acknowledge even to myself.

4 AM. Standing in my apartment facing empty chairs. "First, I establish McDowell's framework. Second, I critique Gaskin. Third, I scrutinize McDowell. Fourth—" But there is no fourth. There is only the sound now, filling the room, two hundred and eighty-seven pages screaming their own contradiction.

9 AM. I walk into the conference room. The committee is seated. Five faces. Professor Harkins says: "Whenever you're ready."

I open my mouth to begin Version 17.

What comes out is:

"The conclusion contradicts the analysis. I spent four years proving transcendental empiricism doesn't work, then claimed it was attractive anyway because I couldn't admit my dissertation destroyed the position I was supposed to defend. I've known since I wrote chapter six. The whole conclusion is an elaborate lie. I'm a fraud."

Silence.

Professor Brennan speaks first. "Yes," she says quietly. "We know."

EXAMPLE 3: RELIGION AS STABILIZER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

USER INPUT (Complete text):

"Religion is shown to be distinct from both rationalism and spiritualism but to combine elements of both. It is further shown that modern rationalism, much like an unregulated economy, collapses into its own antithesis, it being one of the purposes of religion to prevent this collapse."

STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE ANXIETY

Core Anxiety Statement:
"Author fears witnessing a post-religious, hyper-rational society collapse into superstition and chaos, having warned that this would happen but being ignored, now watching the prediction fulfill itself while being powerless to stop it."

STEP 2: SELECT STORY TEMPLATE

Template Selected: "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" (Twilight Zone)

Why: Rational community descends into paranoid chaos. Internal contradictions destroy from within. No external villain—the system eats itself. Protagonist witnesses but cannot stop the collapse. Perfect match for "collapses into its own antithesis."

STEP 3: THE STORY OUTPUT

**The Institute**

Dr. Sarah Brennan arrived at the Institute for Rational Culture on September 3, 2038, to find the chapel locked. Not closed for renovation—locked permanently, with a sign reading "SUPERSTITION CONTAINMENT: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY."

She'd been away for six months. The Institute had been humanity's proudest achievement when she left: a community of 4,000 scientists, philosophers, and engineers who'd abandoned what they called "the irrational residue of civilization." No churches, no rituals, no faith-based anything. Pure reason governing every decision, from meal schedules to child-rearing to conflict resolution through formal logic protocols.

Her colleague Marcus Chen met her in the residential quadrant. His eyes had changed—a brightness that wasn't quite right.

"Welcome back," he said. "You missed the Purification."

"The what?"

"February 12th. The Council determined that residual religious language was corrupting rational discourse. We eliminated 347 words from approved vocabulary. 'Faith,' 'hope,' 'grace'—all gone. Even 'believe' is restricted now. You can only say 'conclude based on evidence.'"

Sarah set down her bag. "Marcus, that's—"

"Necessary. Dr. Yuki proved it mathematically. Once you remove the linguistic structures of irrationality, irrational thoughts become impossible. It's in her paper." He pulled out a tablet, his hands trembling slightly. "I've read it forty-seven times. Have you read it?"

"I just got back—"

"You should read it." His voice rose. "Everyone should read it. Some people haven't. We know who they are."

That evening, Sarah attended the community assembly. Dr. Yuki stood at the podium—the woman whose neuroscience research had won three Nobel Prizes. She looked gaunt.

"We've detected anomalous neural patterns in Sector C residents," Yuki announced. "Scans show activity in brain regions historically associated with religious cognition. These individuals are contaminating the rational environment."

A murmur went through the crowd. Sarah raised her hand. "Dr. Yuki, those regions are involved in pattern recognition, meaning-making, metaphor processing—normal cognitive functions."

Yuki's eyes fixed on her. "Dr. Brennan. You've been flagged for using the word 'meaning' seventeen times in your last published paper. Meaning implies teleology. Teleology implies purpose. Purpose implies design. Design is proto-religious contamination."

"That's not—"

"The mathematics is clear." Yuki displayed an equation on the screen. "Once we eliminate all transcendent reference points, reason achieves perfect closure. But closure requires complete elimination. We've identified forty-three individuals whose neural patterns show non-closure. They'll be relocated to the Remediation Facility."

After the assembly, Sarah found her friend Elena in the library—now called the "Data Repository." Elena was staring at a blank screen.

"They took the Stoics," Elena whispered. "Last week. Someone reported that Marcus Aurelius's 'Meditations' contained mystical elements. Now ancient philosophy is classified as pre-rational contamination."

"This is insane."

"Don't use that word. 'Sanity' and 'insanity' imply a normative standard, which implies values, which implies—" Elena stopped. "I can't keep track anymore. The rules change daily. Yesterday, Dr. Chen claimed that mathematical beauty was a dangerous concept. Beauty implies aesthetics, aesthetics implies subjective experience, subjective experience can't be verified by third parties, therefore beauty is superstition."

"Chen said that? He was giving lectures on mathematical elegance six months ago."

"He's different now. They all are." Elena leaned closer. "Sarah, I need to tell you something. Two weeks ago, some of us started meeting in the old chapel—the one they locked. We just... we needed somewhere to gather. Not to pray or anything religious. Just to sit together. To have space where we weren't being monitored for rational compliance."

"What happened?"

"Someone reported it. Called it 'ritual behavior.' Five people were taken to Remediation. I only avoided it because I wasn't there that night." Elena's hands shook. "The thing is, we were right. They needed that space. Without it, without some pressure valve, the system is... accelerating into something worse."

That night, Sarah couldn't sleep. She pulled up the Institute's founding documents from 2029. Beautiful, rational principles. The elimination of superstition. The triumph of evidence over faith. She'd believed in it completely.

But she'd also written a paper, years ago, about religion as a stabilizing mechanism. About how pure rationalism, unchecked, tends toward the irrational precisely because it cannot accommodate certain human needs for meaning, ritual, community. She'd argued religion had evolved to prevent exactly this kind of collapse.

The Institute Council had dismissed the paper as crypto-religious apologetics.

The next morning, Sarah found the Remediation Facility. It was in the basement of the administration building. Through a window, she saw people sitting in rows, screens flashing sequences of logical proofs. But some of them were rocking back and forth. One woman was pressing her forehead to the floor repeatedly. A man was chanting the axioms of set theory like a mantra.

Dr. Yuki appeared beside her. "Remarkable, isn't it? Pure rationalism produces unexpected behaviors. We're documenting them."

"They look like religious devotees."

"Superficial resemblance only. Their behavior follows logical imperatives. They're seeking certainty through reason. It's completely different from faith-based seeking."

"Is it?"

Yuki turned to her slowly. "Dr. Brennan, you were flagged this morning. Your sleep pattern analysis shows irregular neural activity. You'll need to report for evaluation."

The evaluation consisted of Dr. Chen asking her to derive the foundations of ethics from first principles using only formal logic. When she mentioned human flourishing as a terminal value, he stopped her.

"'Flourishing' is a normative concept. Normative concepts require axiomatic moral premises. All axiomatic moral premises are functionally equivalent to religious belief. You've failed the evaluation."

By October, forty percent of the Institute's original population was in Remediation. The remainder had split into factions, each claiming their version of rationality was the only true rationality. Sarah watched them through her window—once-brilliant scientists standing in circles, repeating formal proofs to each other for hours, checking and re-checking each other's reasoning, hunting for any trace of "contamination."

The Scientific Method faction declared that only empirically testable claims were rational. The Mathematical Platonist faction declared that abstract truth was more fundamental than empirical observation. They stopped speaking to each other. Then they stopped sharing resources. Then they began sabotaging each other's research.

On November 3rd, the first death occurred. Dr. Patel, who'd tried to mediate between factions, was found in his lab. The official report said "rational suicide"—he'd determined, through logical analysis, that his existence was net-negative for Institute productivity.

But Sarah saw the fear in people's eyes. They knew it wasn't suicide.

By December, the Institute had barbed wire between sectors. Each faction claimed the others were contaminated with irrationality. The Mathematics people called the Empiricists "sensory mystics." The Empiricists called the Mathematicians "Platonic cultists." Both groups called anyone who tried to find common ground "synthesizers"—the worst accusation possible.

Sarah was in the synthesizer group. There were thirty-seven of them left. They met in secret, speaking in whispers about whether there might be value in traditional wisdom, in time-tested institutions, in principles that couldn't be derived from pure reason but that somehow worked.

On January 15, 2039, the Mathematical Platonist faction announced they'd proven, through rigorous formal logic, that they alone possessed truth and were therefore justified in eliminating error. They'd rediscovered holy war through pure reason.

The violence lasted three days.

Sarah survived by hiding in the old chapel—the space that had been locked, that no one entered anymore because it represented everything they'd rejected. She sat in the dust and darkness and thought about her paper from years ago. The one they'd dismissed. The one that had predicted exactly this.

When the military finally arrived to evacuate survivors, she emerged to find the Institute in ruins. The community that had prided itself on transcending religion had descended into sectarian violence that would've made medieval theologians blush. They'd recreated every pathology of faith-based conflict using only the tools of reason.

The officer in charge was reading from a tablet. "117 survivors out of 4,000. They're calling it 'The Rationalist Tragedy' in the media." He looked up at Sarah. "What happened here?"

She thought about explaining. About how they'd eliminated every stabilizing mechanism that religion had evolved to provide—ritual, community, shared meaning, limits on certainty, acceptance of mystery. About how they'd thought they could replace it all with pure logic. About how they'd been so rational that they'd become superstitious, so evidence-based that they'd become dogmatic, so committed to eliminating faith that they'd created a dozen competing faiths, each claiming exclusive access to truth.

But she was too tired.
