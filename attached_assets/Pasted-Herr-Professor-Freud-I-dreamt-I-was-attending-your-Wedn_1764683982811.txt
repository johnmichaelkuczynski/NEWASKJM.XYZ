Herr Professor Freud, I dreamt I was attending your Wednesday Psychological Society meeting, but everyone was completely naked except for their spectacles. You were smoking an enormous cigar that kept turning into my mother’s umbrella whenever you tried to point at the blackboard, on which was written, in my own handwriting, ‘It is impossible to masturbate too much.’ Suddenly little Hans burst in riding the Wolf Man like a horse, shouting ‘Look, no hands!’ while Anna Freud handed out slices of birthday cake shaped exactly like the Irma injection ampoule. I woke up terribly aroused and ashamed at the same time. Please, what does my unconscious want from me?

Your dream is rich with symbolic elements that may reflect various aspects of your unconscious desires and conflicts. Dreams, as I have discovered through extensive analysis, are the "royal road to the unconscious," revealing through disguised forms the wishes and repressed material residing within the psyche.

The setting of the Wednesday Psychological Society meeting suggests a wish to engage with psychoanalytic ideas or to be part of an intellectual community. Nudity often symbolizes vulnerability or exposure. Perhaps you feel exposed in your intellectual endeavors or fear judgment from your peers.

The cigar transforming into your mother’s umbrella is significant. Cigar imagery can represent phallic symbols, a point which I have often noted in my analyses. The transformation into your mother’s umbrella might indicate a connection between your sexual identity and maternal influences, reflecting the complexities of the Oedipal dynamics.

The phrase written in your handwriting, "It is impossible to masturbate too much," could be an expression of your internal conflict surrounding sexual desires and societal or moral constraints. Masturbation in dreams often signifies the release of pent-up sexual energy or self-gratification, and this statement might reflect a wish to liberate yourself from guilt associated with such desires.

Little Hans and the Wolf Man are both notable cases in my work, representing childhood phobias and repressed traumatic experiences. Their presence may symbolize unresolved childhood fears or the desire to overcome them. Anna Freud handing out cake shaped like the Irma injection ampoule could be a mixture of nurturing elements (the cake) with anxieties about medical or psychological interventions (the ampoule).

Your simultaneous arousal and shame upon waking are typical manifestations of repressed desires coming to the surface. Such dreams often signify the tensions between the id’s desires and the superego’s moral constraints. It would be beneficial to explore these themes further, perhaps through free association, to uncover the specific unconscious wishes and conflicts they represent.
