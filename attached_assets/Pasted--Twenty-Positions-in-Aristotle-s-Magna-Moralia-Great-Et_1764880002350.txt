**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Magna Moralia* (Great Ethics)**

1. The *Magna Moralia* is **disputed in authorship**—some scholars consider it an early Aristotelian work, others a later summary by a student, but it contains recognizably Peripatetic doctrine.

2. **Ethics is a part of political science**—the study of individual virtue serves the larger inquiry into how to organize the city for human flourishing.

3. The **good is that at which all things aim**—but we seek not the universal Good (against Plato) but the practicable human good.

4. **Eudaimonia is the highest human good**—complete, self-sufficient, and consisting in the activity of virtue over a complete life.

5. The **soul has rational and non-rational parts**—virtue pertains to both: intellectual virtue to the rational, moral virtue to the non-rational part as it obeys reason.

6. **Virtue is a mean between extremes**—excess and deficiency are vices; the virtuous disposition hits the intermediate appropriate to the circumstances.

7. The mean is determined by **right reason (orthos logos)**—the standard is what the practically wise person would judge.

8. **Moral virtue arises through habituation**—we become courageous by performing courageous acts, temperate by exercising temperance.

9. **Voluntary action** is action that originates in the agent with knowledge of particulars—compulsion and ignorance excuse.

10. **Choice (prohairesis)** is deliberate desire for things in our power—it follows deliberation and is essential to moral evaluation.

11. The **particular virtues** are enumerated and analyzed: courage, temperance, gentleness, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and others.

12. **Justice** is analyzed as both general virtue (lawfulness) and particular virtue (fairness in distributions and transactions).

13. **Natural justice** exists alongside conventional justice—some things are just by nature, not merely by local enactment.

14. **Practical wisdom (phronesis)** is the intellectual virtue that discerns the right means to good ends—it is inseparable from moral virtue.

15. **Akrasia (incontinence)** is acting against one's better judgment due to passion—the incontinent person knows the good but fails to do it.

16. **Pleasure** accompanies virtuous activity but is not itself the good—it completes activity as a supervenient end.

17. **Friendship** is necessary for happiness—no one would choose a friendless life even with all other goods.

18. **Self-love** rightly understood is virtuous—the good person loves what is best in himself (reason) and acts accordingly.

19. The happy person needs **external goods and good fortune**—virtue is necessary but not sufficient; bodily and external goods matter.

20. The ultimate standard is the **noble (to kalon)**—the virtuous person chooses virtuous action because it is noble, not merely because it is pleasant or useful.
