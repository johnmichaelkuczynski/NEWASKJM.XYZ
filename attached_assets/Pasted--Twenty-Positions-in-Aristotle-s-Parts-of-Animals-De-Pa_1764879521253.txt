**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Parts of Animals* (De Partibus Animalium)**

1. This work provides **causal explanations** for the anatomical features cataloged in the *History of Animals*—it asks why animals have the parts they do.

2. **Final causation is primary** in biological explanation—parts exist for the sake of their functions; nature does nothing in vain.

3. The biologist must study **form more than matter**—the defining features of an animal are its functional organization, not its material constituents.

4. **Necessity in biology is conditional (hypothetical)**, not absolute—given that an animal is to perform a certain function, certain material conditions are necessary.

5. One should not disdain the study of **lowly creatures**—every natural kind exhibits order and beauty to those who investigate its causes.

6. Parts exist either for the sake of **survival (to zen)** or for the sake of **living well (to eu zen)**—some organs are indispensable, others serve flourishing.

7. **Uniform parts** (flesh, bone, blood) are composed of the four elements and serve as matter for non-uniform parts.

8. **Non-uniform parts** (organs, limbs) are composed of uniform parts and perform the characteristic functions of the animal.

9. **Blood** is the final form of nutriment and the material from which all other parts are constituted—it is the fundamental vital fluid.

10. The **heart** is the central organ of the body—the seat of vital heat, the source of blood, and the origin of the vascular system.

11. The **brain** exists to cool the blood and counterbalance the heart's heat—Aristotle denies it is the seat of sensation or intelligence.

12. **Lungs** provide cooling through respiration; animals without lungs use gills or other structures for the same purpose.

13. Animals with more blood and hotter constitutions are generally **more active, intelligent, and courageous**—temperament correlates with physiology.

14. Parts that are **necessary for survival** (nutritive, sensory, locomotive) are found universally; parts for well-being vary more across species.

15. Nature provides **defensive and offensive parts** according to each animal's way of life—horns, tusks, claws, hooves serve protection and predation.

16. When nature allocates material to one part, it **economizes elsewhere**—no animal has both horns and tusks; resources are finite.

17. The **right side** of the body is naturally stronger and more honorable than the left—humans exhibit this most fully by standing upright.

18. **Humans are the most upright** of animals because their nature is most divine—they alone have their upper parts oriented toward the upper cosmos.

19. Humans have **hands because they are rational**—not rational because they have hands; the hand is the tool of tools, suited to the versatile intelligence.

20. Throughout, Aristotle insists on the **methodological priority of function over structure**—we understand what a part is by understanding what it is for.
