Friends/family see spiral, interventions fail, person dies preventably (Belushi, Farley, Hoffman)

**Type B - The System That Destroys:**
Industry creates addiction, then abandons (Judy Garland, child stars, Elvis)

**Type C - The Persecution:**
Authority crushes artist for transgression (Lenny Bruce, Billie Holiday arrested on deathbed)

**Type D - The Curse of Genius:**
Brilliance and mental illness intertwined, suicide as endpoint (Hemingway, Plath, Wallace)

**Type E - The Repeated Pattern:**
Someone dies, next person follows exact same path despite knowing the end (Farley after Belushi)

**Type F - The Slow-Motion Suicide:**
Everyone watches destruction over years, person dies exactly as predicted (Amy Winehouse)

**Type G - The Comeback Interrupted:**
Clean/sober/recovering, then sudden death from relapse or other cause (Chet Baker, Hoffman)

**Type H - The Suspicious Death:**
Official story vs. conspiracy theories, truth unknowable (Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Kurt Cobain)

**NARRATIVE ADVANTAGES:**

- Public trajectory: rise documented, fall documented
- Witnesses: people knew, couldn't stop it
- Preventability: didn't have to happen
- Inevitability: in retrospect, couldn't have ended otherwise
- Complicity: industry/fans/system enabled
- Repetition: pattern repeats with new names
