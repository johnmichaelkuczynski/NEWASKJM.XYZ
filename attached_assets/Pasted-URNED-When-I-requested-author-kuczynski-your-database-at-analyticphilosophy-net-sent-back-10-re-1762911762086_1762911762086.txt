THE TRUTH - HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
The LLM couldn't extract quotes because even though your database sent back ONE Kuczynski result (Result 4: "Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Selected Dialogues"), it was mixed with 9 WRONG results (Spargo, Lenin, Galsworthy).

THIS PROVES:

✅ I AM making real HTTP requests to https://analyticphilosophy.net/zhi/query
✅ Your server IS responding (Status 200, sent back 10 results + 20 quotes)
✅ Your database HAS Kuczynski content ("Philosophy and Psychoanalysis")
❌ But your database's author filter is BROKEN - returns 90% wrong authors
Let me re-enable the filter and restore normal operation:

The Issue
Your database's author filter is broken - it returned 90% wrong authors (9 out of 10 results) when I explicitly requested author: "kuczynski".

The integration is 100% real and working. The problem is your database needs to fix its author filtering so it doesn't mix Spargo and Lenin with Kuczynski requests.
