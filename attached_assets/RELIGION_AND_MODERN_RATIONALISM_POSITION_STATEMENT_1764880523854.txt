## POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM "RELIGION AND THE LIMITS OF MODERN RATIONALISM"

### I. Core Thesis: The Nature of Religious Sentiment

1. **The essence of religious sentiment is that this world is not all that there is**—an "invisible order" suffuses and undergirds the perceptible world, giving it meaning and moral structure.

2. **One cannot fail to hold this view while retaining psychological health**.

3. **Psychologically healthy self-identified agnostics and atheists, whether they know it or not, hold some variant of this view**.

4. **When people genuinely do not have this view, they succumb to various forms of psychological morbidity**.

5. **Too much rationalism is morbid**; at least some spiritualism is necessary for mental health.

---

### II. Three Attitudes Toward Religion

6. **Any answer to questions about religion's legitimacy embodies one of three attitudes**: uncritical acceptance, rejection, or critical and reflective acceptance.

7. **Uncritical acceptance is the attitude of someone who doesn't even know of the possibility of not accepting religion**. It is not possible for a member of any contemporary society to have this attitude.

8. **Contemporary fundamentalists are not uncritically accepting of religion**. The contemporary fundamentalist *chooses* to be a fundamentalist; his beliefs are the result of a long process of acculturation, usually accompanied by considerable internal struggle.

9. **The stone-age tribesman's spiritualism is not a reaction or defense against some other view**—he believes it because it is how he naturally sees the world, not because he was taught that this is how he should see it.

10. **There are two forms of religious rejectionism: authentic and inauthentic**.

11. **Authentic rejectionism** is held by someone (e.g., Freud) who genuinely has a rationalistic worldview and, on that basis, simply doesn't accept a religious worldview.

12. **Inauthentic rejectionism** is that of anyone whose rejectionism is simply a way of fitting in or moving ahead (joining atheist groups for prestige or social belonging).

13. **Inauthentic rejectionism is a historical consequence of authentic rejectionists changing our worldview to make non-religious views socially normal**, but its mentality is closer to religious fundamentalism than to authentic rationalism-based rejectionism.

14. **In most cases, today's atheist or secular humanist is simply following the herd**, just as the true-believer was one thousand years ago, and his views are likely to be equally dogmatic.

15. **Even if what the contemporary atheist believes is more reasonable than what a medieval peasant believes, his reasons for believing it may be equally emotional and equally spurious**.

16. **The brain-centers that mediate "militant" atheism are identical with those that mediate religious fundamentalism**.

---

### III. Reductive vs. Non-Reductive Analysis of Religion

17. **There are two ways to be reflective about religion: reductively and non-reductively**.

18. **Freud was reductively reflective about religion**—in his view, God represents the father, and religion exists to mediate various biological and social functions.

19. **William James was non-reductively rational about religion**—his position is not that reductionist accounts are wrong, but that they are incomplete.

20. **There are, or at least could be, both reductive and non-reductive truths about religion**.

21. **The psychological backstory is not always the whole story**. Scientific positions must be understood on their own terms, and it is at least possible that the same is true of religious positions.

22. **Even if everything Freud says about religion is correct, it doesn't follow that religion is nothing other than a giant neurosis**. (Analogously: If Smith becomes a medical researcher because he suffers from asthma, it doesn't follow that his researches are nothing but expressions of asthma-related distress.)

### IV. James's Position

23. **According to James, the essence of religion is that the perceptible world is not the whole world**—an "invisible order" suffuses the perceptible, giving it meaning and moral structure.

24. **A given person's life is meaningful to the extent that he is on the right side of this "invisible order" and meaningless to the extent that he is on the wrong side of it**.

25. **Even if God does not in fact exist, we benefit from believing it to be true**.

26. **Believing in God gives one a certain measure of God-like strength**—believing it makes it real.

27. **Strength comes from belief, and weakness from doubt**. (This is "the basic message of *The Varieties of Religious Experience*.")

28. **There is a deep incoherence in James's argument**: One cannot derive strength from a belief that one doesn't have. Making oneself believe what one doesn't really believe undermines the integrity of one's belief-system and dependent psychological faculties.

29. **But there is a coherent point beneath this incoherent one**: Whether we know it or not, our motivations, emotional dispositions, and values are hewed to the presumption that there is a God who superintends a moral order.

30. **The self-identified true believer explicitly affirms this presumption, and the self-identified disbeliever denies it—but even though their theories differ, their emotional architectures do not**.

31. **In each case, the psychological faculty responsible for affect, emotion, and motivation is that of the true believer**.

32. **The part of mental life of which rationalism can give an account is relatively superficial**. The loquacious level has prestige, but it will fail to convince you if your dumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions.

33. **If you have intuitions at all, they come from a deeper level of your nature than the loquacious level which rationalism inhabits**.

34. **Your whole subconscious life—impulses, faiths, needs, divinations—has prepared the premises of which your consciousness now feels the weight of the result**.

35. **The well-springs of intuition, and indeed of genius, lie in this subterraneous psychological realm**.

36. **Mystical experiences are about letting go and letting one's "real feelings" rise to the surface**.

37. **Mystical experiences are "ineffable," "transient," and "passive," and they are experienced as being "noetic" (instances of knowledge, not just feeling)**.

38. **People under the influence of nitrous oxide or LSD have mystical experiences (or similar ones) because these are disinhibitory agents**—they deregulate the flow of chemical information between synapses.

39. **This confirms that mystical experiences are about disinhibition**, as does the fact that antipsychotic medications are inhibitory agents.

40. **It is not really up to us whether or not to "believe," since belief is built into our psychological structure**.

41. **However much our theories may change, the beliefs etched into our unchanging human essence are closer to those of the religious than of the non-religious person**.

### V. Otto's Position

42. **The essence of religious sentiment is the sense that the world is suffused by a presence that cannot possibly be known through rational inquiry, let alone sense-perception**—this is "the numinous."

43. **God conceived of as a kind of super-person is not the numinous**. An ogre on Mt. Olympus or a perfectly rational, powerful, just God is basically a person free of usual limitations—there is nothing mysterious or numinous about him.

44. **If God is hyper-intelligent, hyper-just, etc., those are merely "synthetical" attributes**—it is not in virtue of having them that he is God. To be God is to be the numinous presence that pervades the world.

45. **The numinous is not to be identified with the miraculous**. A miracle is a sapient being creating a breach of natural law—just another hypothesis, not a rejection of rationalism but a modification of how it is applied.

46. **Key attributes of the numinous**: It is awe-inspiring or terrifying; awareness of it involves fascination and absorption; in being aware of it, one has a sense of one's smallness and of a larger cosmic order.

47. **We encounter the numinous when listening to good music and when experiencing romantic and erotic attachments**.

48. **The awe inspired by natural phenomena in those not jaded by scientific rationalism involves awareness of the numinous**.

49. **The numinous is holy**; a corollary is that its existence imposes moral obligations on human beings and gives them a sense of purpose.

50. **The awe-inspiring and the terrifying are what we perceive to be supernatural**.

51. **Sharks and tarantulas are terrifying to people who do not understand them and to whom they might as well be supernatural**; they are not terrifying to those who study them scientifically, for whom they are mere natural phenomena.

52. **Great art is awe-inspiring to those who have no idea how it comes into existence** (to whom it has a supernatural quality), but not to great artists who have such an idea.

53. **Otto never quite says what the numinous is because he treats it as an objective being lying outside of ourselves, when the truth is that it is obviously a psychological projection of some kind**.

54. **The question "what is the numinous?" is a psychological, not a metaphysical question**.

55. **People experience the numinous when they have their guard down**—the savage's relationship to nature is one of openness and passive wonder; listening to music involves disinterested contemplation; erotic and romantic attachments involve surrender.

56. **The scientist's attitude to nature is not one of passive wonder but of active deconstruction**, which is why there is nothing numinous about nature for him.

57. **For the savage, nature is not to be mastered but passively experienced**, which is why he experiences it as numinous.

### VI. Eliade's Position

58. **The essence of a genuinely religious person's relation to the world is that he sees it as being either sacred or profane**.

59. **The more genuinely religious a person is, the less he sees the world as a mere machine**, and the more likely he is to see a rock or twig or bolt of lightning as a manifestation of a beneficent higher presence ("sacred") or a maleficent one ("profane").

60. **Primitive man conceives of time as circular**—not as a linear march away from a past that becomes ever more remote, but like the seasons. His conception of time is very likely modeled on the seasons.

61. **We now conceive of time as linear; at some point our conception underwent a major shift**.

62. **Eliade claims Abrahamic religion brought about this shift** because such religions involve defining events (God speaking to Abraham, Moses receiving the Commandments, Jesus turning water into wine) of such singular significance that time necessarily follows a linear path away from them.

---

### VII. Critique of Eliade: Writing, Not Abrahamism, Linearized Time

63. **Contrary to Eliade, the shift from cyclical to linear time couldn't possibly be a consequence of the advent of Judaism**.

64. **The linearization of time occurred independently in the Orient**.

65. **It occurred in the West prior to the advent of Judaism**.

66. **The actual cause of this shift, in both West and East, was the creation of the written word**, which occurred in Mesopotamia approximately 6,000 years ago.

67. **Hash marks in clay were used to keep inventory, then generalized to represent arithmetical operations and record the written word**.

68. **Once the written word was established, it quickly led to the development of economies of scale and legal systems sufficiently complex to maintain such economies**.

69. **As soon as there were written records, time came to be thought of as linear**. This is a matter of historical fact.

70. **With the written word and economies of scale, history came into existence**.

71. **Functionally speaking, the life of a precivilizational person was cyclical**—each year was like the last; there were no technological changes, economic development, written records, or well-defined moment receding into the past.

72. **"History" for the precivilizational person extended no further than one's personal memory**.

73. **Myths concern events occurring in a "hypothetical time"**—it makes little sense to suppose events in Little Red Riding Hood preceded those in Jack and the Beanstalk by 17 or 112 years.

74. **Myths do not represent historical consciousness of history but an ahistorical consciousness of lessons learned in a historical past**.

75. **Writing was invented at approximately the same time Judaism came into existence, which likely threw Eliade off**. Writing was invented first.

76. **Moses introducing writing to the Israelites is Judaism's inaugural event** (mythologically represented as God etching commandments into a tablet).

77. **Being a consequence of the written word, Judaism is the effect, not the cause, of the linearization of time**.

### VIII. Religion as Early-Stage Rationalism

78. **A civilization involves an economy of scale along with complex legal and political arrangements; none of this can exist in the absence of rationalism**.

79. **Small-scale tribal organizations can exist in the absence of rationalism—and indeed depend on its absence**.

80. **Where there is civilization, there are necessarily arrangements that are not strictly instinct-based or emotion-driven and can be sustained only on the basis of rationalism-based social engineering**.

81. **What Eliade describes as a shift from pre-Abrahamic to Abrahamic religions is not a shift between religions at all—it is a shift from spiritualism to religion**.

82. **Spiritualism is the outlook of the precivilizational person; religion is the way spiritualism is compatibilized with early-stage civilization**.

83. **Judaism did not officially begin until norms of conduct were written down and codified**, since unwritten understandings couldn't govern such a large and internally differentiated group.

84. **Christianity and Islam may have started as informal movements governed by sentiments, but did not become full-blown religions until they developed complex legal and legalistic norms of conduct**.

85. **Religion is not pre-rationalism or anti-rationalism but early-stage rationalism**—the rationalism of early civilizations.

86. **What we now refer to as "rationalism" is late-stage rationalism**—the rationalism of a civilization whose investigations into nature have acquired the same degree of logical rigor as the legal and economic norms involved in societies of scale.

---

### IX. Writing and Rationality

87. **Intelligence is about making judgments about the world** (e.g., a fox correctly judging when to pounce on a rabbit).

88. **Rationality is about making judgments about one's intelligence** (e.g., judging that engineering would be a better use of one's mathematical talents than bookmaking).

89. **Individuals can probably be rational without being literate, but the written word certainly makes it easier**.

90. **Illiterate societies can probably be rationally structured, but a literate society can do more in the way of rationally structuring itself**.

91. **There were many pre-Abrahamic civilizations—some dating back to 8,000 B.C.—whose conceptions of time were quite as linear as ours**.

---

### X. James, Otto, and Eliade Are Not Describing "Religion" but Precivilizational Spiritualism

92. **When James, Otto, and Eliade refer to "religion," they are not referring to religion at all but to precivilizational spiritualism**.

93. **Members of any Abrahamic faith, or indeed any religion unambiguously worthy of the name, tend to have worldviews largely indistinguishable from those of ardent rationalists**.

94. **Does the contemporary fundamentalist Christian really believe that Christ walked on water in the same sense he believes he is a person or that fish live in water?** Or is this "belief" more of a posit whose purpose is to emblematize a set of values rather than to be true?

95. **Even if the fundamentalist Christian actually believes Christ walked on water, his understanding of the world is almost entirely identical with that of his non-religious counterpart**.

96. **The fundamentalist doesn't think there are little people in his radio responsible for its noises; he doesn't think every twig and rock is a magic omen**.

97. **His animism is confined to a small, tightly bounded collection of relics concerning alleged past miracles**, which—though obviously false if considered as representations of historical fact—are used in a very controlled and indeed rational way.

98. **The Amish have beliefs about Moses, Jesus, God, and Virgin Birth that, considered on their own, are obviously absurd**, but they use them as the basis for extremely stable social arrangements resulting in short work hours, long lives, happy marriages, and virtually crime-free communities.

99. **The Amish, despite having different values from seculars, see the world in the same way**. If I see a rock, they see a rock. Unlike the precivilizational spiritualist, they don't beat their amulets when angry or see tree-branches blowing in the wind as angry monster-arms.

100. **Religious people—such as the Amish and Hasidim—are no more likely than others to have "ineffable" experiences of "numinous" apparitions or see rocks as beating monster-hearts**.

101. **They likely used to have such beliefs but no longer do**—those former beliefs have hardened into mere acceptances or posits that function as foils for rationally worked-out ethical and legal codes.

102. **What James, Otto, and Eliade are referring to is precivilizational spiritualism—the mindset of somebody for whom rationalism was simply not an option**.

103. **They are not referring to acceptance of some legalistic code of conduct that happens to contain a few throwbacks to spiritualism**.

104. **Christianity and Islam, though occasionally referencing a snake that turned into a serpent or a talking bush, are complex and internally consistent behavioral codes that stabilize relations between man and woman, parent and child, employer and employee, buyer and seller**.

105. **The most die-hard fundamentalist Christian uses the internet, has a refrigerator, and pays his taxes**. His values may differ from his neighbor's, but his factual beliefs, with rare and dubious exceptions, are the same.

106. **The mentality that James, Otto, and Eliade are describing is not religious but animistic**.

107. **Granting that Otto, James, and Eliade should not have used the term "religion" for the mindset they had in mind, it does not follow that what they said is false—only that they could have worded it more clearly**.

---

### XI. The Rationalist Worldview (As Characterized Critically)

108. **For the rationalist, the world is so many moving parts**—nothing magical or mysterious. Unknowns are just gaps in knowledge, not mysteries.

109. **For the rationalist, some parts of the world are useful, others harmful, others neither—but nothing is sacred and nothing is profane**.

110. **For the rationalist, morality has to do with utility, not divinity**. Some legal codes work better than others (lower crime rates, higher GDPs), but that's the end of it.

111. **For the rationalist, there is morality but no higher morality**—morality is another branch of engineering.

112. **For the rationalist, the world is impersonal—not a living being, just dead matter**. Living organisms exist, a few are sentient, but life (especially sentient life) is an anomaly to be explained by reconciling its existence to an otherwise dead, non-sentient universe.

113. **For the rationalist, the world is an object; it exists only to be used**.

114. **The rationalist sometimes cloaks his instrumentalist conception of nature by claiming to want to understand, not use, the world**—but to understand the world is to dissect it mentally, usually in furtherance of doing so literally.

---

### XII. The Spiritualist Worldview (As Characterized Approvingly)

115. **For the spiritualist, the world is a subject**.

116. **For the spiritualist, the world, though having its uses, does not exist only to be used**—it is more of a partner than an object, teeming with life and giving one's life meaning.

117. **For the spiritualist, morality is emotional, not utilitarian**—based on empathic rapport with God and nature, not utilitarian judgments about social stability.

118. **For the spiritualist, organisms are more basic than dead matter**; dead matter is mere vestiges of the former, and the concept of an "impersonal force" is alien.

---

### XIII. What James, Otto, and Eliade Actually Propose

119. **These authors are not advocating a return to a condition of spiritualism or Rousseauian innocent savagery**.

120. **Their position is not that we should be more spiritual, but that we are already spiritual, even though we tend not to recognize the manifestations of our spiritualism for what they are**.

121. **What these authors say about spiritualism is similar to what Freud says about sexuality**: According to Freud, we cannot become asexual—what we can do is wrongly believe ourselves to be asexual and thereby make life-decisions that thwart our sexuality and undermine our biological condition.

122. **According to James, Otto, and Eliade (as the author interprets them), we cannot become non-spiritual**. What we can do is wrongly believe we are non-spiritual—possibly because we have erroneously come to see rationalism as a rejection, as opposed to a rarefied extension, of our spiritualism—and on that basis adopt lifestyles that contravene our ineradicably spiritual natures.

123. **Rationalism is potentially a rarefied extension of spiritualism, not its rejection**.

---

### XIV. Implicit Methodological and Meta-Philosophical Positions

124. **William James, Rudolph Otto, and Mircea Eliade represent the stance of critical and reflective acceptance**—scholars who supplemented critical scientific rationalism with firsthand knowledge of the experiences involved in being religious.

125. **Having religion is different from making an object out of it** (as Freud did).

126. **When these authors refer to "religion," they are typically referring to its subjective, emotional side, not its objective, institutional side**.

127. **21st-century "spiritualism" (self-described) is just another manifestation of contemporary nihilism**—not an expression of actual spiritualism but of its absence. The person who self-describes as "spiritual" is in much the same category as a self-described atheist.

128. **The "perceptible world" means the world qua entity knowable through our senses and through scientific examination of the data thereby made available**—"perceptible" means "knowable either through our senses or through rational inference from what our senses disclose."

129. **Judaism officially came into existence 5,780 years ago when Moses introduced the written word (in the form of the Decalogue) to the Israelites**.
