Twenty Positions in Aristotle's Categories

Primary substances (individual things—"this man," "this horse") are ontologically fundamental; everything else is either predicated of them or present in them.
Secondary substances are the species and genera under which primary substances fall; they are less fundamental but still substantial.
There are exactly ten categories (highest genera of being): substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, affection.
The "said of" relation (predication) is distinct from the "present in" relation (inherence).
Substance admits no contrary—there is no opposite of "man" or "horse."
Substance does not admit of degrees—one man is not more a man than another.
Substance can receive contraries while remaining numerically one (the same individual can become hot, then cold).
Quantity is either discrete or continuous—number is discrete; line, surface, body, time, and place are continuous.
Quantity has no contrary and does not admit of degrees.
Parts of some quantities have position relative to one another (parts of a line), while others do not (units of number).
Relatives are defined correlatively—a master is master of a slave; double is double of a half.
Some relatives are simultaneous by nature with their correlatives; knowing which correlative exists entails knowing the other exists.
Quality has four species: states/dispositions, natural capacities, affective qualities, and shape/figure.
Quality admits both contraries and degrees—something can be more or less white; justice is contrary to injustice.
The similar and dissimilar are predicated only in respect of quality.
There are four types of opposition: contradictory, contrary, privative (possession/privation), and relative.
Contradictories admit no intermediate and one must be true of any subject; some contraries admit intermediates (black/white), others do not (odd/even).
Privation differs from negation—blindness is privation of sight in what naturally has sight, not mere absence.
Priority has multiple senses: temporal, existential (what can exist without the other), order of exposition, and value.
Change/motion falls into six species: generation, corruption, increase, diminution, alteration, and locomotion.
