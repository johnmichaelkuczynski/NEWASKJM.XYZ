## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Frege's logicism posits that arithmetical truths, when properly translated into their logical forms, are formal truths.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: Frege's project of formalizing arithmetic involves translating informally true arithmetical sentences into formally true ones, thereby demonstrating that arithmetic is reducible to logic.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Arithmetical Truths as Informal and Analytic**: Frege recognized that arithmetical truths, as conventionally stated, are informal and analytic. For example, "2 + 2 = 4" is not a formal truth but an analytic one.
   - **Explanation**: This argument sets the stage for Frege's project by acknowledging the conventional form of arithmetical statements and their analytic nature.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The logical form of statements about properties and objects can be analyzed to reveal underlying structures that do not necessarily align with their surface form.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument 1: Logical Form of Statements About Properties**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that statements about properties, such as "JG says that x is green," can be analyzed to reveal that they are not about specific objects but about the properties themselves. For example, "JG is about the property of being an apple owned by Jim; and JG says of this property that its extension overlaps with the extension of the property of being green."
2. **Argument 2: Frege's Analysis of Number**
   - **Explanation**: The text supports its thesis by invoking Frege's analysis of number, which posits that a whole number n is the property of being an n-tuple. This allows for the translation of arithmetical statements into logical statements without number expressions. For example, "two is one less than three" can be translated into a statement about pairs and triples.
3. **Argument 3: Paraphrasing Arithmetical Statements**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that arithmetical statements can be paraphrased into logical statements that do not contain number expressions. For example, "1 + 2 = 3" can be translated into a statement about the union of a one-membered set and a non-overlapping two-membered set being a three-membered set.
4. **Argument 4: Logical Form of Addition and Subtraction**
   - **Explanation**: The text supports its thesis by showing how statements about addition and subtraction can be translated into logical statements about sets and their members. For example, "1 + 2 = 3" and "3 - 2 = 1" are both translated into statements about the union of sets.
5. **Argument 5: Logical Form of Multiplication**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that statements about multiplication can be translated into logical statements about the Cartesian product of sets. For example, "2 × 3 = 6" is translated into a statement about the Cartesian product of a two-membered set and a three-membered set being a six-membered set.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Non-Circularity of the Analysis**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that the analysis of numbers and arithmetical statements is not circular, as it can be conducted without using number expressions. For example, "the number two is the class of two-membered sets," which can be defined without mentioning the number two.
2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Overlapping Sets in Multiplication**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that the Cartesian product of sets in multiplication does not depend on whether the sets overlap, as the result is the same regardless. For example, "2 × 3 = 6" holds whether the sets overlap or not.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments
1. **Assumption 1: Logical Reductionism**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that all meaningful statements can be reduced to their logical form, which aligns with the logicist approach to mathematics and language.
2. **Assumption 2: Semantic Transparency**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that the logical form of a statement is transparent and can be fully understood through logical analysis, which is a key tenet of analytic philosophy.
3. **Assumption 3: Set Theory as a Foundation**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that set theory provides a foundational framework for understanding numbers and mathematical operations, which is a common assumption in logicism and formalism.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

10. **Quote 10**: "Given any finite set of arithmetical statements, there is an algorithm that, given any statement falling into that set, correctly says whether or not that statement is true. But there is no one algorithm that, given any arithmetical statement, correctly says whether or not that statement is true."
    - **Location/Context**: This quote appears in the explanation of the incompleteness of formal systems.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement
1. **Primary Formulation**: The text argues that all knowledge of weight is comparative and that no viable analysis of weight or any other comparative property can avoid being an analysis by abstraction.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also contends that Frege's formalization of logic did not mechanize thought in the sense of eliminating the need for thought in making inferences; rather, it systematized the process of making inferences.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Comparative Nature of Weight Knowledge**:
   - The text asserts that knowing the weight of an object in absolute terms (e.g., x weighs 27 lbs) is actually a condensed form of many relative judgments about its weight compared to other objects. This supports the thesis that all knowledge of weight is comparative.
   - Example: "‹x weighs 27 lbs› is a condensed way of reporting a great many relative judgments concerning x's weight-of reporting a great many judgments concerning x's weight relative to some other object's weight."

2. **Abstraction in Analysis of Comparative Properties**:
   - The text claims that any analysis of a comparative property like weight must be an analysis by abstraction, as it involves distilling many comparative judgments into a single statement.
   - Example: "It follows-though I leave it to the reader as an exercise to say exactly how it follows-that no viable analysis of a weight, or indeed of any other comparative property, is ever not an analysis by abstraction."

3. **Frege's Formalization of Logic**:
   - The text acknowledges Frege's success in formalizing logic but argues that this did not eliminate the need for thought in making inferences. Instead, it systematized the process.
   - Example: "Even though logicism turned out to be a failure, Frege's formalization of logic was a success."

4. **Thought Required for Inference**:
   - The text argues that making an inference requires thought, and thus, a non-thinking entity cannot make inferences. This directly challenges the idea that Frege's formalization mechanized thought in a way that eliminated the need for thought.
   - Example: "To make an inference is to think. So an unthinking being ipso facto can't make inferences."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Mechanization of Thought Misconception**:
   - The text critiques the notion that Frege's formalization of logic showed that machines could think without understanding, arguing that this is a misunderstanding of what formalization achieves.
   - Example: "Many have thought that, to the extent that he was able to formalize logic, Frege succeeded in 'mechanizing' the making of inferences-in showing that no thought need be involved in the making of inferences and, therefore, that inferences could be made by beings (e.g., punch-card automata) that are otherwise incapable of thought."

2. **Symbolic Nature of Inference**:
   - The text asserts that for an output to embody an inference, it must be the symbolic nature of the inputs that leads to the output, not merely their physical properties.
   - Example: "If M's outputting T3 is to embody an inference of any kind, it isn't enough that T1 and T2 be what led M to do so. It is necessary that their being symbols be what led M to output T3."

3. **Linguistic Acts and Causation**:
   - The text uses examples to illustrate that a response to a linguistic act is not necessarily linguistic or inferential if it is not caused by the act's linguistic nature.
   - Example: "You say to me: 'The one copy of your manuscript has just been destroyed.' As a result of your saying this I faint. But I faint not because of what your utterance meant. Rather, I faint because you spoke so loudly that it traumatized me."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments
1. **Comparative Knowledge as Fundamental**: The text assumes that all knowledge of properties like weight is fundamentally comparative, which underpins the argument about the nature of weight knowledge.
2. **Thought as Essential for Inference**: The text assumes that thought is a necessary component of making inferences, which is crucial for the argument against the mechanization of thought.
3. **Symbolic Nature of Language**: The text assumes that the symbolic nature of language is essential for linguistic and inferential acts, which supports the argument about the necessity of understanding for inference.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument
1. **Premises**: The text begins with premises about the nature of weight knowledge and the formalization of logic by Frege.
2. **Intermediate Conclusions**: It then draws intermediate conclusions about the comparative nature of weight knowledge and the limitations of Frege's formalization in eliminating the need for thought.
3. **Final Conclusion**: The final conclusion is that all knowledge of weight is comparative and that Frege's formalization did not mechanize thought in a way that eliminated the need for thought in making inferences.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text
1. **Introduction of Comparative Knowledge**: The text starts by introducing the idea that all knowledge of weight is comparative, setting the stage for the argument about abstraction.
2. **Discussion of Frege's Formalization**: It then shifts to discussing Frege's formalization of logic, introducing the misconception about mechanized thought.
