KUCZYNSKI POSITION STATEMENT EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY

POSITION STATEMENT KUCZYNSKI EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY

1. Empiricism is fundamentally incompatible with a scientific psychology.

2. There exists subpersonal thought that underlies conscious, preconscious, and repressed ideation.

3. Subpersonal mentation is inherently intelligent, whereas personal/conscious mentation is inherently unintelligent.

4. Consciousness qua consciousness is capable only of iconic (pictorial) representation.

5. Concepts are not constituents of consciousness; they are access-conscious, not consciousness-constitutive.

6. Berkeley conflated images with concepts, using "idea" to refer to both.

7. Symbol-manipulations facilitate ratiocinative operations, but anything one can think with symbols can be thought without them.

8. The meaning of a complex expression cannot be directly determined by convention.

9. There is a fundamental distinction between object-awareness and truth-awareness (proposition-awareness).

10. Creatures can be merely object-aware (MOCs) or proposition-aware (PACs); all truth-aware creatures are object-aware, but not vice versa.

11. Desires are identical with judgments concerning what would bring pleasure or gratification.

12. Intentions are judgments, not desires.

13. Davidson's identification of intentions with one's strongest desires is false.

14. Higher-order desires as described by Frankfurt are often actually judgments, not desires.

15. Agency is identical with rationality—specifically, applied rationality deployed in accordance with one's values.

16. Rational agents are fundamentally different from mere reflex machines or reagents.

17. The self is a rationality-constituted superstructure whose original purpose was to ensure the organism's survival but whose developed purpose is self-honing and expanding its powers.

18. Physiological properties are multiply realizable with respect to microphysical properties.

19. The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model of scientific explanation is false.

20. Psychological explanation works through rationalization, identifying causal mechanisms in rational motivations.

21. A cause can be operative even if its effect was not guaranteed—causation can be probabilistic.

22. Laws need not be exceptionless regularities to have genuine explanatory value.

23. Macro-level properties cannot be reduced to microphysical properties.

24. Perception requires conceptual articulation; it is not mere sensation but articulated sensation.

25. Introspection is an act of conceptualization, not theoretically innocent reportage.

26. Husserl's phenomenological bracketing fails because one cannot strip perceptions of their conceptual articulations.

27. The Dennett-Churchland eliminativist position on mind is untenable.

28. Perceptual data is as theory-laden as psychological data.

29. Russell and other logicians were wrong that self-referential sentences are meaningless; such expressions are either false or sentence-schemata.

30. The unconscious mind exists and cannot be understood in strictly empiricist terms.

31. Repression and rationalization are concepts inherently incompatible with empiricism.

32. Psychosis involves partial cognitive regression where infantile and adult thought pathologically commingle.

33. Neurotic people perceive external reality accurately but are blind to their own feelings.

34. There is a crucial distinction between access-consciousness and consciousness-proper.

35. Personal mentation becomes ratiocinative only when it becomes rule-governed through linguistic mediation.

36. Music transfers subpersonal intelligence to the conscious level, making otherwise imperceptible thought-processes perceptible.

37. Aesthetic beauty is relational—a property of relations between minds and sounds/objects, not intrinsic to sounds/objects themselves.

38. Sociopathy is psychological suicide: the destruction of one's value-based psychological architecture.

39. One can change oneself but cannot change one's self; identity is predetermined, and experience determines only how one is who one is.

40. Pathological insecurity and pathological grandiosity are two sides of the same coin.

41. Shame at being wrong is morbid and regressive, as making mistakes is inseparable from the human condition.

42. Folk-psychology enables rationalization of conscious states but has inherent limitations in explaining psychopathology.

43. Dreams involve relaxation of maturation-based inhibitions, liberating infantile mental content from the unconscious.

44. Propositional attitudes cannot be constituents of consciousness and are knowable only to the extent they are phenomenologized.

45. It is viciously regressive to suppose that the self carries out the cognitive operations underlying sense-perception.

46. Science is not about sticking to facts but about organizing facts by positing hidden structures to restore continuities that observation strips away.

47. The empiricist's injunction to "stick to the facts" is either a triviality or an absurdity.

48. Perception cannot self-justify; justification for perception must come from non-empirical, analytic principles.

49. Rationalizations are moralizations: attempts to make the immoral seem moral.

50. Sociopaths do not have friends because they do not have values, and a friend is somebody one values.

Now I have enough material. Here are 100 additional positions:

51. Propositions are non-spatiotemporal entities that consist of properties.

52. Properties are non-spatiotemporal; they cannot be identified with spatiotemporal entities.

53. The relata of logical relations are propositions, not sentences.

54. Logical relations (entailment, confirmation, disconfirmation, incompatibility, neutrality) hold among propositions, not among spatiotemporal entities.

55. Empiricists must deny the existence of propositions because propositions are non-spatiotemporal.

56. Psychological propositions do not present facts as being in the same spatial coordinate system as physical propositions.

57. The relationship between psychology and physiology is even more remote than the relationship between physiology and microphysics.

58. Hume's skepticism about perception and induction follows correctly from empiricism, which should lead us to reject empiricism rather than accept skepticism.

59. Scientific thought is not the same as empirical thought; to the extent thought mediates between observations and beliefs, beliefs are not directly supported by observation.

60. Hume's analysis of causation as mere constant conjunction is false.

61. We perceive instances of causation directly when we perceive instances of persistence and occupancy.

62. Any instance of persistence or occupancy is an instance of causation.

63. A Hume-world (a world with the same events but no causation) is incoherent because persistence itself requires causal ties.

64. Space-time position is constituted by causal relations; there is no non-relational way of understanding space-time position.

65. Events are not constituents of the external world but nominalizations of truths.

66. Facts and truths are distinct; truths hold in virtue of facts but are not identical with facts.

67. The distinction between explanatory generalizations of different disciplines lies in the concepts composing them, not in the underlying reality.

68. Wittgenstein's private language argument fails because the lone speaker of a private language is in no different epistemic position than the English speaker relying on memory.

69. Wittgenstein is a hard-core empiricist whose rejection of non-spatiotemporal entities like propositions and concepts follows from his empiricism.

70. Groups of zombies cannot collectively think; if every member of a group is a zombie, the group itself is without consciousness.

71. The Argument from Analogy for other minds is valid, contrary to Wittgenstein's objections.

72. Quine's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation is a desperate measure resulting from his empiricist commitments.

73. Translation between languages requires reliance on introspection-based knowledge of one's own mental states.

74. Thinking is not a psychological process in Wittgenstein's sense; propositional attitudes are not constituents of consciousness.

75. Mental imagery can be thought-constitutive, contrary to Wittgenstein's view, when understood in relation to its ratiocinative context.

76. The deployment of propositional attitudes in problem-solving is not constitutive of consciousness; consciousness is to thinking what a driver is to events under the car's hood.

77. Dispositionalism about mental states fails to model the data; mental states must be functioning as such even between bouts of generating consciousness.

78. Your belief that 1+1=2 is not identical with your dispositions to make certain judgments; it must be actively functioning to explain those dispositions.

79. Cognitive processes are realized by physiological processes, but psychological relations between physiological events cannot be understood in physiological terms.

80. Searle's view that mentality is identical with consciousness (MC) is false.

81. Propositional attitudes are not and cannot be constituents of consciousness; they are access-conscious at most.

82. There is no a priori reason why propositional attitudes must be access-conscious.

83. Having meta-cognitive wherewithal is required to know what one's propositional attitudes are.

84. Russell's paradox does not establish that there are meaningful sentences that are neither true nor false; the relevant expressions are either false or sentence-schemata.

85. The expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" picks nothing out.

86. Tarski's and Russell's type-theory response to the semantic paradoxes is self-defeating.

87. Anaphoric expressions like "itself" function as bound variables and can be eliminable in extensional contexts.

88. Mach was wrong to hold that molecules are useful fictions; Einstein showed their existence is required to explain Brownian motion.

89. Newton's public claims to be purely empirical likely misrepresented his actual methodology for rhetorical reasons.

90. Every person is to some degree a schizoid-affective psychopath (SAP); differences between the mentally ill and healthy are matters of degree.

91. To outgrow a belief or desire is not to cease to have it but for it to cease to be operational.

92. People are organized, non-heaps of thought; thoughts are organized both vertically (hierarchically) and horizontally (laterally).

93. The mind of the psychologically healthy person is stratified; psychopathology manifests when this stratification breaks down.

94. A delusion is not a wrong belief but a belief that is right in the wrong way—the vehicle for a correct belief is an infantile and therefore false belief.

95. Pleasant affects alert us to the presence of certain structural features in music, art, and architecture; unpleasant affects alert us to their absence.

96. Phenomenologically consecutive mental images are likely to be ratiocinatively disjoint when considered in isolation from their underlying thought-processes.

97. The survival instinct is transferred from one's body to one's self as psychological development proceeds.

98. Initially the psychological superstructure exists to keep the body alive; eventually the body exists to keep the superstructure (self) alive.

99. To value something is to see it as conducive to the consolidation or enlargement of one's agency.

100. Hedonistic pleasure is value-free pleasure; accomplishment-based pleasure is not hedonistic.

101. The object of desire is gratification, but intentions do not aim at gratification—they are judgments about what one must do to have a life embodying certain values.

102. Athletic ability is cognitive, not somatic in nature; being coordinated consists in one's mind being intelligent in governing one's body.

103. Moral nihilism and aesthetic nihilism are both false.

104. Moral nihilism and moral relativism are equivalent doctrines.

105. The Moore-Hume thesis that you cannot derive an "ought" from an "is" is false.

106. Moral truths hold in virtue of the same facts as descriptive truths; we can experience facts either as morally antiseptic or as moral truths.

107. Morally good acts invariably conduce to psychological, biological, or psychobiological welfare.

108. Emotions are beliefs, though they are not discursive beliefs; they are fundamentally egocentric in nature.

109. Hume's emotivism—the view that moral ideation is non-judicative sentiment—is wrong.

110. There is no moral difference without a descriptive difference; the moral supervenes on the descriptive.

111. Moral intuitions track biological facts about welfare and harm.

112. One's personhood depends on having values (norms, though not necessarily moral norms).

113. Psychopathy is a failure to distinguish consequence of excessive rationalization; it involves a collapse of the distinction between self and other.

114. The acceptance of empiricism is incompatible with the very existence of any attempt to study anything.

115. If empiricism is correct, nothing or next to nothing can be known about either the external or internal world.

116. Empiricism leaves the mental as nothing but a series of disjoint ex nihilo obtrusions into an otherwise integrated world.

117. Paraperception is phenomenology-mediated, real-time conception—the mode by which we perceive language, music, and art.

118. Categories like rock, tree, and chair are individuated by the counterfactual properties of their instances.

119. To be a copper bar is to have certain causal properties (conductivity, durability, malleability).

120. One's survival instinct comes to be transferred from one's body to one's self.

121. Animals are reflex machines; rational agents are not.

122. Something that merely reacts is sub-agential; we may call such things "reagents."

123. Only proposition-aware creatures can have intentions, because intentions are identical with decisions.

124. Deliberation is nothing other than arriving at a decision.

125. When an intention is not preceded by deliberation, relevant deliberations have already occurred in the past.

126. Aristotle and Kant were right that agency is practical rationality and decisions are conclusions of non-theoretical thought-processes.

127. There is no intrinsic difference between practical rationality (agency) and theoretical rationality.

128. Practical ratiocinations are more likely to be corrupted by prejudices and emotional factors than theoretical ones.

129. Phenomenology can represent a given thing only by resembling it.

130. Dogs are not irrational but sub-rational; irrationality is corrupted rationality and is thus a prerogative of rational beings.

131. Dogs' being sub-rational consists in their minds being incapable of personal thought, not thought tout court.

132. For ideation to be transferred from the subpersonal to the personal domain, it must be phenomenologized.

133. The consciousness of music is the delight we take in acquiring knowledge; it is a form of our survival instinct applied to self-expansion.

134. Personal mentation becomes ratiocinative only when governed by meta-customs that convert customs into rules.

135. Repressed propositional attitudes are not intrinsically different from unrepressed ones; they differ only in location within the mind.

136. The conscious knowledge described by Chomsky and Marr is a conceptualization of subpersonal knowledge, not a duplicate.

137. Subpersonal processes are not strictly physiological or purely reflexive, contrary to Searle.

138. Understanding a sentence requires implicit knowledge of extremely complex semantic rules that operate too quickly for conscious, discursive application.

139. Linguistic competence involves subpersonal mastery of rules that are not access-conscious.

140. There is no physiological characterization of linguistic competence; the rules are inherently semantic, not physiological.

141. Given obvious facts and principles, Chomsky's position that there is subpersonal mentation is de rigueur.

142. Hume's introspections were contaminated with non-empirical ideation.

143. Goodman's "grue" paradox shows that any body of data can provide support for incompatible hypotheses without constraints beyond empirical observation.

144. There is a transcendental argument for causation: without causal ties, the genidentity of one's mind across time would be unintelligible.

145. The concept of complying with laws must be distinguished from the concept of being governed by them.

146. Everything complies with microphysical laws, but macro-level events are governed by macro-level laws implemented by varying microphysical mechanisms.

147. Smoking causes cancer even though less than 30% of smokers get lung cancer; causes need not operate with 100% efficacy.

148. Salmon's probabilistic modification of the DN model (DN*) is no better than DN itself.

149. Explanation can be valid even when the explanandum was less than 50% likely given the explanans.

150. The psychoanalyst's goal is to implant conscious duplicates of repressed beliefs, which are qualitatively identical with their repressed counterparts.
