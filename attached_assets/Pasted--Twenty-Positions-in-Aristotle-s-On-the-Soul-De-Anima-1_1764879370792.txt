**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *On the Soul* (De Anima)**

1. **Soul (psyche) is the form of a natural body having life potentially**—it is the first actuality of an organized living body.

2. Soul and body are **not two separate substances** but related as form to matter—the soul is the actuality of which the body is the potentiality.

3. Asking whether soul and body are one is therefore **like asking whether the wax and its shape are one**—the question dissolves once hylomorphism is understood.

4. **Soul is not itself a body** but cannot exist apart from a body (with one possible exception)—it is not independently subsistent.

5. There are **three grades of soul**: nutritive (plants), sensitive (animals), and rational (humans)—each higher grade presupposes the lower.

6. The **nutritive soul** is the most basic principle of life, responsible for nutrition, growth, and reproduction.

7. The **sensitive soul** adds perception, desire, and locomotion—these capacities require bodily organs.

8. **Perception is the reception of sensible form without the matter**—the eye receives the form of redness without receiving red paint.

9. Each sense has its **proper object** (color for sight, sound for hearing); error concerning proper objects is minimal.

10. There are also **common sensibles** (motion, rest, number, shape, magnitude) perceived by multiple senses, and **incidental sensibles** perceived through association.

11. The **common sense (koinē aisthēsis)** integrates deliverances of the five senses and enables awareness of perceiving.

12. **Imagination (phantasia)** is distinct from both perception and thought—it is a movement resulting from actual perception that enables images to persist in the soul.

13. The **rational soul** adds the capacity for thought (nous)—grasping universals, engaging in reasoning, contemplating truth.

14. **Thinking differs from perceiving**: perception requires bodily organs and is of particulars; thought requires no organ and grasps universals.

15. The intellect is **potentially all intelligibles**—it becomes what it thinks by receiving intelligible forms.

16. Aristotle distinguishes **agent intellect and patient intellect**—one is like light that makes colors visible; the other is like a tablet on which nothing is written.

17. The **agent intellect is separable, impassible, unmixed, and eternal**—this notoriously obscure passage has generated centuries of controversy.

18. The object of thought in act **is identical with the thinking intellect**—in thinking a form, the intellect becomes that form.

19. **Desire (orexis)** is the source of animal locomotion—movement requires both a cognitive apprehension of a goal and an appetitive striving toward it.

20. The soul is ultimately defined by its **characteristic activities**, not its material substrate—to understand what soul is, study what living things distinctively do.
