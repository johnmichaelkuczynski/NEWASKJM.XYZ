"According to Rawls, a just society is one that one would choose to belong to if one knew nothing as to what one's position in that society would be and if one knew nothing as to one's gender, ethnicity, intelligence-level, or other such status-relevant parameters. Such a society would be a squalid bureaucratic wasteland, similar to the Soviet Union, and its entire structure would be a weapon for the mediocre to hold back the gifted, with the result that people as a whole, including the mediocre, would be prevented from flourishing. There is obviously a sense in which the social contract described by Rawls is "fair", but there is no meaningful sense in which the resulting society would be just. Moreover, since a Rawlsian society would quickly degenerate into a condition of bureaucratic tyranny, in which everybody oppressed everybody, it would be irrelevant that its inception occurred in a "fair" way. Several vigorous attempts to create and run societies along Rawlsian lines have been implemented, and they all failed utterly, showing how wrong Rawls' analysis is."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Case #2847: Social Equity Violation**

Dr. James Kensington stood before the three-member tribunal in the windowless room. Director Chen opened his file without looking up.

"Dr. Kensington. Quantum physicist. Published seventeen papers in the last three years." She paused. "Do you know why you're here?"

"No."

"Your work creates hierarchical knowledge structures. In January, you published findings that fewer than sixty people globally can comprehend. In March, you declined collaboration with Regional Collective #7, stating they 'lacked mathematical foundations' for your research. In April, you solved in two days what your assigned team had worked on for six months."

"I was trying to help—"

"You demonstrated superiority," Administrator Voss interrupted from Chen's left. "Superiority creates inequality. Inequality creates suffering. You've been reported by fourteen colleagues for 'making them feel inadequate.'"

Kensington's pulse accelerated. "Should I have pretended not to understand?"

"You should have raised the collective capacity rather than highlighting individual excellence," Chen said. "The Fairness Accords of 2028 established that capability differences cause social harm. Your abilities harm others by comparison."

"This is insane."

Commissioner Park, on Chen's right, spoke for the first time. "Dr. Kensington, why do you believe your individual achievements matter more than collective wellbeing?"

"Because individual excellence lifts everyone. My research could—"

"Could create more inequality. More feelings of inadequacy. More social destabilization." Park shook her head. "We learned from the failures of hierarchical societies. Excellence was simply another word for oppression."

Chen closed the folder. "You have two options. Cognitive Realignment: twelve months where you'll learn to operate within community median capabilities. Or Settlement #7—permanent relocation with other equity resisters. No technology above 1950s level. No communication with fairness zones."

"And if I refuse both?"

"Refusal isn't available to you."

Kensington looked at the three faces. Calm. Certain. The logic was perfect within their system: eliminate capability differences, eliminate suffering caused by comparison. They weren't evil. They'd simply built a society where excellence was a crime.

"Settlement #7," he said.

"Expected," Voss noted. "Resisters prefer isolation. This confirms the psychological profile."

Chen pressed a button. Two attendants entered. "Process for transfer. Remove research credentials. Reassign his publications to Collective Archive under general authorship."

As they led him out, Park added: "This isn't punishment, Dr. Kensington. We're protecting society from the harm your gifts would cause."

He turned. "What about the harm your system causes?"

"We've eliminated comparison," Chen replied. "Without comparison, there's no suffering. Without suffering, there's justice."

The door closed.

---

Four months later, Kensington sat in the Settlement #7 compound watching rain through a plastic window. Fifty-three exiles—scientists, artists, two concert pianists whose hands now worked farming equipment. They'd tried to continue their work at first. But without resources, equipment, or even basic paper beyond rations, their gifts atrophied.

Last week, Dr. Elena Vasquez—Fields Medal winner—stopped speaking. She spent her days arranging rocks by size. Some defense mechanism, Kensington thought. Or just final recognition that this was permanent.

The compound radio announced the Equity Board had exceeded targets. Social destabilization incidents down forty percent. Citizen satisfaction—carefully adjusted for removal of destabilizing elements—at record highs.

Kensington looked at his hands. Still capable, technically. But capable of nothing. The system didn't need to kill excellence. It only needed to remove conditions in which excellence could exist.

This wasn't punishment, Chen had said.

It was extinction through perfect administration.

"In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell's minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the "Myth of the Mental." I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content."

STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE ANXIETY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Anxiety Statement:**
"Author fears being exposed at dissertation defense as having spent years demolishing the very position he claims to defend, with the committee recognizing the contradiction between his analysis (everything is problematic/dubious/undermined) and his conclusion (but it's attractive anyway)."

**Template Selected: "The Tell-Tale Heart" (Poe)**

Structure: Paranoid first-person narrator insisting on soundness while elaborately revealing guilt through defensive over-explanation. The very thoroughness of the defense becomes proof of the crime.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STEP 3: THE STORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Defense**

True!—I am nervous—very nervous, but why will you say that I am unsound? The dissertation is rigorous. Four years of systematic analysis. Two hundred and eighty-seven pages. Every objection examined. Can you call a man unsound whose methodology is so thorough?

Listen. Let me show you how carefully I proceeded.

First: seventy-three pages establishing McDowell's minimal empiricism in exhaustive detail. Professor Harkins wrote "masterful" in the margin of page forty-seven. I still have that draft. I look at it sometimes when the doubt comes.

Second: forty-one pages demonstrating that Gaskin's critiques are faulty. His minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Very dubious! I proved this through twelve distinct arguments. Twelve! Can you imagine such thoroughness proceeding from an unsound mind?

Third—and here is where lesser scholars would have stopped—I scrutinized McDowell's own credentials. I showed his linguistic idealism is problematic. I engaged Dreyfus's phenomenological critique. I demonstrated—conclusively—that Dreyfus's accusation of "Myth of the Mental" is correct. Correct! This means McDowell's direct realism is problematic.

Fourth: one hundred and seventeen pages on Burge's critique of disjunctivism. I proved Burge successfully undermines it. And disjunctivism—as I carefully documented—is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Crucial!

Now. Having established all this—you see how methodically I worked—I concluded that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content.

There. Perfectly sound.

My defense is April 15th. Three weeks. I've prepared seventeen versions of my opening statement. Professor Harkins will be there. Professor Chen. And the external examiner from MIT, Professor Brennan—she published that paper on disjunctivism I cited. The one that... but I've prepared for every question.

At night I rehearse. I face the empty chairs. "First, I establish McDowell's framework." But my hands shake. Why should they shake? Two hundred and eighty-seven pages cannot be unsound.

Last week I reread the conclusion. The final paragraph: "While minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content, and while McDowell's direct realism is problematic, and while Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious, and while Burge successfully undermines disjunctivism which is crucial for transcendental empiricism, nevertheless transcendental empiricism remains an attractive alternative."

I sat in my office for an hour. The building was empty. I could hear the fluorescent lights humming. A sound like a heartbeat. Steady. Relentless.

Professor Harkins emailed yesterday. "Looking forward to your defense. I'm sure the committee will have questions about your conclusion." Questions about my conclusion! The conclusion follows necessarily from the analysis. Necessarily!

My colleague Marcus read it two weeks ago. His face was strange when he returned it. "Very thorough," he said. "Really comprehensive demolition of the position." Demolition! Why that word? "Did Harkins approve this version of the conclusion?"

Why wouldn't he approve? The conclusion is perfectly consistent with—but it is! Because attractive does not mean correct. I explain this in footnote 347. Page 281. Eleven hundred words distinguishing eight senses of "attractive." Eight senses! This is thoroughness, not—

Not what?

I wake at 3 AM now. Last night I opened the file. The cursor blinked at the end. In the dark I heard it again—that sound. Like the lights. Like a heartbeat. The sound of something that knows.

I added another paragraph. Eight hundred words explaining "attractive" means systematic elegance rather than truth-functional adequacy. Now the conclusion is six pages. Surely that demonstrates seriousness.

Professor Brennan emailed this morning. "Excellent scholarship. I have questions for the defense regarding the relationship between your analysis in chapters 2-5 and your conclusions in chapter 6."

The relationship! There is a relationship! After analyzing, one concludes. After examining evidence, one judges. Basic philosophical methodology!

I wrote back immediately. Attached a seventeen-page addendum clarifying "attractive alternative." I can provide additional argumentation during defense. Additional! As though two hundred and eighty-seven pages were insufficient!

The sound is louder now. I hear it in my office. In the library. In the hallways. That steady rhythm. The sound of two hundred and eighty-seven pages of careful argumentation proving exactly what I claim it doesn't prove.

I've timed how long I can explain the conclusion without my voice wavering. This morning: four minutes thirty-seven seconds. Yesterday: five minutes twelve seconds. I'm getting worse.

Last night I dreamed I was at the defense. Harkins asked me to explain the conclusion. I opened my mouth and what came out was not words but that sound. That heartbeat. Louder and louder. And everyone could hear it. They had always heard it. The sound coming from the dissertation itself, from the space between the analysis and the conclusion, from where the contradiction lived and breathed and waited.

I woke at 3 AM standing at my desk. The dissertation open. I don't remember getting out of bed.

Today is April 14th. Tomorrow is the defense. Navy suit laid out. Blue tie. Professional. Sound.

All seventeen opening statements memorized. I'll choose based on the committee's demeanor. This is good planning, not panic. Why would anyone say panic?

But who would say it? Why am I defending against accusations no one has made?

11 PM. Defense in ten hours. I should sleep. Instead I'm adding footnote 348 to page 281. It will explain the methodological distinction between systematic analysis and final evaluation. It will make everything clear.

The sound is so loud now. Like it's coming from inside the laptop. From the heart of the argument. Two hundred and eighty-seven pages of demolition cannot be followed by "nevertheless attractive alternative." Cannot be. The words contradict in their structure. And tomorrow they will all see it.

2 AM. I write to Harkins: "I need to withdraw. I need to revise the conclusion. I need—" But I don't send it. Withdrawal means admitting four years built on a contradiction I couldn't acknowledge even to myself.

4 AM. Standing in my apartment facing empty chairs. "First, I establish McDowell's framework. Second, I critique Gaskin. Third, I scrutinize McDowell. Fourth—" But there is no fourth. There is only the sound now, filling the room, two hundred and eighty-seven pages screaming their own contradiction.

9 AM. I walk into the conference room. The committee is seated. Five faces. Professor Harkins says: "Whenever you're ready."

I open my mouth to begin Version 17.

What comes out is:

"The conclusion contradicts the analysis. I spent four years proving transcendental empiricism doesn't work, then claimed it was attractive anyway because I couldn't admit my dissertation destroyed the position I was supposed to defend. I've known since I wrote chapter six. The whole conclusion is an elaborate lie. I'm a fraud."

Silence.

Professor Brennan speaks first. "Yes," she says quietly. "We know."
