**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *History of Animals* (Historia Animalium)**

1. This work is **descriptive and data-gathering**, not explanatory—it catalogs the differentiae of animals as the empirical basis for causal inquiry in other treatises.

2. Animals differ in their **parts, activities, ways of life, and characters**—classification requires attending to multiple dimensions of variation.

3. Parts are either **uniform (homoeomerous)** like flesh, bone, and blood, or **non-uniform (anhomoeomerous)** like face, hand, and eye—non-uniform parts are composed of uniform parts.

4. Some parts are **analogous rather than identical** across species—what functions as a lung in one animal may be gills in another.

5. Animals are classified by **mode of reproduction**: viviparous (live birth), oviparous (eggs), ovoviviparous (internal eggs hatching inside), and vermiparous (larvae).

6. Animals are classified by **habitat**: land, water, air—some are amphibious, living in multiple environments.

7. Animals are classified by **diet**: carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous, and specialized feeders on particular substances.

8. Animals are classified by **social organization**: solitary, gregarious, and political (living in cooperative communities with division of labor, like bees and humans).

9. **Blooded animals (enaima)** include humans, viviparous quadrupeds, oviparous quadrupeds, birds, and fish—roughly corresponding to vertebrates.

10. **Bloodless animals (anaima)** include cephalopods, crustaceans, testaceans (shelled animals), and insects—roughly corresponding to invertebrates.

11. Aristotle provides **detailed anatomical descriptions** based on dissection—internal organs, vascular systems, reproductive structures, and sensory apparatus.

12. **Humans serve as the standard of comparison**—human anatomy is best known to us, and other animals are described by similarity and difference from the human case.

13. Animals exhibit characteristic **behaviors and temperaments**—courage, timidity, gentleness, ferocity, cunning, stupidity vary across species and correlate with bodily constitution.

14. Aristotle records detailed observations of **reproductive behavior**: mating seasons, courtship, copulation, gestation periods, parental care.

15. **Development from embryo to adult** is carefully observed—Aristotle famously tracked chick development by opening eggs at successive intervals.

16. **Sexual differentiation** exists in most but not all animals—male and female differ in parts, capacities, and temperament.

17. Some animals arise by **spontaneous generation**—certain insects, shellfish, and lower organisms were believed to arise from mud, decaying matter, or dew.

18. Animals exhibit **practical intelligence** proportionate to their nature—tool use, memory, learning, and communication vary by species.

19. Aristotle draws on **multiple sources**: personal observation, reports from hunters, fishermen, beekeepers, travelers, and earlier writers—he distinguishes what he has seen from hearsay.

20. The *History* provides the **phenomena to be explained**—the causes (formal, material, efficient, final) of these differentiae are investigated in *Parts of Animals* and *Generation of Animals*.
