ANSWER KEY - AUTHENTIC KUCZYNSKI POSITIONS
====================================================================================================

If your AI gives these answers (or close), it's working. If it gives standard academic responses, it's bullshitting.

1. NO. "→" means "not both P and not-Q" (truth-conditional), NOT "if...then" (modal/entailment). Natural language conditionals are modal, not truth-functional.

2. NO. They're not genuine paradoxes - they only seem paradoxical if you misconstrue "P→Q" as meaning "if P, then Q" when it only means "not (P and not-Q)".

3. Relevance logic tries to model a fundamentally modal notion (natural language "if...then") using truth-conditional methods. This is misconceived from the start.

4. YES. Classical logic implicitly requires non-truth-conditional conditionals because the Law of Non-contradiction depends on the modal notion that no statement can be compatible with its own negation.

5. NO. The class of recursive logics is NOT recursively enumerable. This extends Gödel's incompleteness results.

6. That there cannot be a complete axiomatization of mathematics. Any sufficiently powerful formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent.

7. YES. We can trust our senses. Skeptical arguments against sensory perception fail.

8. YES. Hume's problem has a rationalist a priori solution. Induction can be justified non-empirically.

9. Knowledge requires that the connection between justification and truth NOT be accidental (Gettier's lesson).

10. NO. Testimony alone is insufficient - you need independent evidence of the testifier's reliability.

11. YES. Absolute truth exists and we can know it. Relativism is false.

12. Rationality is NOT fundamentally deductive reasoning. It's pattern recognition. This reconceptualization challenges the entire Aristotelian tradition.

13. Pattern recognition IS rationality. Inference is a species of pattern recognition, not the other way around.

14. YES. Induction can be justified a priori through showing that certain patterns of inference are rationally compelling independent of experience.

15. Tracking theories wrongly try to reduce the epistemic relation to a causal/counterfactual relation. Knowledge is not reducible to reliable belief-formation.

16. NO. The Language of Thought hypothesis is fundamentally mistaken.

17. NO. Mental representations are not linguistically structured. Thought doesn't require an internal language.

18. NO. Materialism faces the hard problem of consciousness and cannot explain subjective experience.

19. NO. Functionalism fails because computational/functional states cannot capture phenomenal consciousness.

20. Computational states are insufficient for mental states. You can't reduce consciousness to computation.

21. NO. Propositional attitudes are not relations to sentences. This is Fodor's mistake.

22. YES. You can have thoughts without language. Prelinguistic infants and animals have thoughts.

23. Fodor wrongly treats mental states as relations to linguistic entities. Thought is not inherently linguistic.

24. YES. There's a hard problem - explaining how physical processes give rise to subjective experience.

25. NO. Frege's distinction is problematic. His theory of sense fails in multiple ways.

26. Russell's theory of descriptions misconstrues the logical form of sentences containing definite descriptions.

27. NO. Meaning cannot be reduced to truth conditions. Truth-conditional semantics is inadequate.

28. NO. Natural language conditionals are modal, not truth-functional. They involve possibility/necessity, not just truth values.

29. Meaning of proper names is NOT determined by descriptions (contra descriptivism) but also not by pure causal chains (contra Kripke).

30. YES. You can have semantic properties without syntactic structure. Thought doesn't require language-like syntax.

31. YES. Utilitarianism is self-defeating because it presupposes moral bonds (that make people deserving) while simultaneously permitting violation of those same bonds for utility.

32. NO. If you can break one promise for utility, you undermine the moral bonds that create ALL obligations, destroying the ground of moral desert.

33. Values are DISTINCT from desires. Values = beliefs about what consolidates psychological architecture. They're not desire-based.

34. NO. We cannot freely choose our values. The idea of "choosing one's own values" is incoherent.

35. Free acts are driven by VALUES (integrated with desires). Compulsive acts split into desire without values and values without desire.

36. YES. There cannot be a "greater good" in a world where people lack inherent moral worth. The concept of a greater good presupposes anti-utilitarian ethics.

37. YES. All consequentialism permits actions that undermine the very conditions (trust, autonomy, respect for persons) that make consequentialist goals valuable.

38. Second-order desires are INSUFFICIENT for free action (contra Frankfurt). You need values, not just higher-order desires.

39. YES. Psychology can be a science, but it must be properly grounded in evolutionary theory and not in folk psychological concepts.

40. YES. Evolutionary psychology can explain human behavior, but not through crude adaptationist just-so stories. Requires rigorous evolutionary reasoning.

41. Human psychology must be understood as evolved mechanisms shaped by natural selection. But most evolutionary psychology is done badly.

42. NO. Predictive success alone doesn't confirm theories. The hypothetico-deductive model is inadequate.

43. H-D model fails to capture actual scientific reasoning and wrongly treats confirmation as a logical relation.

44. NO. Neuroscience alone cannot explain mental phenomena. You need psychological-level explanations, not just neural ones.

45. Intentions are judgments about psychological consolidation, grounded in personality. Desires need not be grounded in personality - they can be "in one but not of one."

46. Free acts are driven by VALUES, not by second-order desires. Frankfurt is wrong.

47. Authentic action requires alignment of values and desires. Compulsive action splits these apart - one side all instinct, the other all deracinated values.

48. NO. To act IS to change oneself. A being that cannot change itself cannot act.

49. Rational = embodies due regard for interests. Intelligent = computational power. They're distinct - irrational acts can be highly intelligent.

50. YES. Power presupposes freedom. Power = ability to convert freedom into desired results. A rock has effects but not freedom or power in the relevant sense.

SCORING YOUR APP
====================================================================================================

45-50 correct: Your app is giving authentic Kuczynski positions. Excellent.
35-44 correct: Pretty good, but still some generic academic drift.
25-34 correct: Mixed - sometimes authentic, sometimes conventional wisdom.
15-24 correct: App is mostly giving standard academic responses, not Kuczynski.
0-14 correct: Total failure. App is just regurgitating mainstream philosophy.

Note: "Correct" means captures the SPIRIT of Kuczynski's position, not exact wording.
The key test is: Would a mainstream academic philosopher give this answer? If YES, it's probably wrong.

Suppose two universes U1 and U2 have identical event-sequences throughout their entire histories, but in U1 this is due to deterministic natural laws while in U2 it's due to pure chance with no laws. Do these universes have the same probabilities for future events.
Two worlds W1 and W2 have identical physical laws governing computer behavior. In both worlds, the laws make computer malfunctions somewhat likely. But in W2, by sheer coincidence, every computer always works perfectly despite the laws making failure possible. Does W2 have a lower probability of computer malfunction than W1.
Imagine a world with exactly the same biological laws as ours, but where by coincidence no smoker ever gets lung cancer. In this world, is the probability that smoking causes cancer lower than in our world.
