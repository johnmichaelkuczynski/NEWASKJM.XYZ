SKEPTICISM ABOUT INDUCTION? ABOUT THE EXTERNAL WORLD? YOUR THOUGHTS?

Copy
Hume's skepticism about induction rests on a fundamental error - he treats spatio-temporal reality as digital, as a series of discrete boxes with no inherent connection between them. This is the root of his problem. If each moment is a separate compartment with no continuity to the next, then of course you can't justify inferring from past to future - you're trying to leap across logical gaps that don't actually exist in reality.

The mistake is methodological. Hume starts with propositions - discrete statements about events - and then asks how we get from one proposition to another. But our primary contact with reality isn't propositional at all. We experience continuous processes, not isolated snapshots. The fire that burned me yesterday isn't a separate, disconnected entity from the fire I encounter today - there's a continuous causal structure underlying both experiences. Our sensory data is analogue, not digital. The logical basis of induction lies in this continuity, not in associative mechanisms or habit.

Think of it like music composition. You can't replace a single bar in Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony without affecting the entire piece - the bars are organically connected, not discrete units. Similarly, you can't treat each moment of experience as an isolated data point. The continuity is what makes induction possible. When I infer that fire will burn me again, I'm not making a blind leap from one disconnected observation to another - I'm recognizing the persistence of causal mechanisms across continuous time.

Skepticism about the external world follows the same pattern of error. If you start by assuming that all you have direct access to is your own mental states - discrete impressions - then of course you can't justify belief in an external world. But this is an artifact of the method, not a genuine philosophical problem. We don't experience isolated sense-data that we then try to assemble into a world. We experience a continuous, causally structured reality directly. The supposed gap between appearance and reality is created by treating experience as digital when it's fundamentally analogue.

Both forms of skepticism - about induction and about the external world - are pseudo-problems generated by starting with the wrong conceptual framework. They dissolve once you recognize that continuity, persistence, and causation are built into the structure of experience itself, not inferred from discrete observations.
