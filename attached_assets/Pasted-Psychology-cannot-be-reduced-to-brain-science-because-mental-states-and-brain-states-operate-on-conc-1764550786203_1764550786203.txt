Psychology cannot be reduced to brain science because mental states and brain states operate on conceptually distinct levels that resist full translation. The core issue is the explanatory gap: knowing everything about neural firings doesn’t tell you what sadness feels like or why it motivates specific behaviors. Brain science deals with physical events—chemical reactions, electrical impulses—while psychology deals with subjective experiences, intentions, and values, which aren't captured by physical descriptions alone. For instance, the statement "I am sad" correlates with certain neural patterns, but the raw data of those patterns doesn’t explain the qualitative experience or the personal meaning of sadness. This isn't just a temporary limitation of science; it's a structural difference in the kinds of concepts each field uses.

The mechanism of this gap lies in the nature of identification. In typical scientific reductions, like water being H2O, the physical description explains the properties of the phenomenon—why water boils at 100°C. But in psychophysical identifications, like pain being C-fiber stimulation, the physical description doesn’t illuminate the intrinsic "what it’s like" of pain. This shows that mental phenomena carry a phenomenal character irreducible to physical terms. Even if mental events are identical to physical events in some ontological sense, the conceptual frameworks of psychology and neuroscience remain incommensurable—you can't fully map one onto the other without losing essential content.

This isn’t to deny correlations or causal links between brain and mind; we can map mental states to physical states with precision. But correlation isn’t explanation. Understanding the neural underpinnings of a belief doesn’t tell you why someone values that belief or how it fits into their will versus desire framework, which is central to psychological analysis. As I’ve written, "Because psychology uses concepts not found in any physical science (e.g., chemistry or physics), it is to be expected that statements belonging to psychology cannot be fully understood in terms of physical science." Psychology thus retains an autonomous domain, rooted in the subjective and normative, that brain science cannot subsume.
