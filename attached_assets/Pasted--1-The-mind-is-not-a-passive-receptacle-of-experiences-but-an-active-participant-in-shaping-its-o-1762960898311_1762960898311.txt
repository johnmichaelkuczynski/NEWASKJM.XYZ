GIVE ME TEN QUOTES OF YOURS ABOUT MIND

Certainly! Here are ten quotes from my writings about the mind:

1. "The stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is, in my belief, neither mind nor matter, but something more primitive than either."

2. "Few things are more firmly established in popular philosophy than the distinction between mind and matter."

3. "Those who are not professional metaphysicians are willing to confess that they do not know what mind actually is, or how matter is constituted."

4. "The exact definition of the word 'mental' will, I hope, emerge as the lectures proceed; for the present, I shall mean by it whatever occurrences would commonly be called mental."

5. "I wish in these lectures to analyse as fully as I can what it is that really takes place when we, e.g., believe or desire."

6. "Idealists, materialists, and ordinary mortals have been in agreement on one point: that they knew sufficiently what they meant by the words 'mind' and 'matter' to be able to conduct their debate intelligently."

7. "Yet it was just in this point, as to which they were at one, that they seem to me to have been all alike in error."

8. "The reasons which I shall give against this theory will be mainly derived from previous authors."

9. "Philosophers have maintained often that matter is a mere fiction imagined by mind, and sometimes that mind is a mere property of a certain kind of matter."

10. "Both mind and matter seem to be composite, and the stuff of which they are compounded lies in a sense between the two, in a sense above them both, like a common ancestor."

These quotes reflect my ongoing examination of the nature of mind and its relationship to matter, as well as my exploration of the fundamental constituents of reality.
