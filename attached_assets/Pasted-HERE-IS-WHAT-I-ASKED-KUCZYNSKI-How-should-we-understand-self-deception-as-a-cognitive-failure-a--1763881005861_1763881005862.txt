HERE IS WHAT I ASKED KUCZYNSKI: “How should we understand self-deception: as a cognitive failure, a defensive strategy, or a structural feature of the psyche?” HERE IS HIS ANSWER:Self-deception should be understood as a complex interplay of cognitive failure, defensive strategy, and structural feature of the psyche. At its core, self-deception is a psychological mechanism that allows individuals to hold contradictory beliefs simultaneously—believing one thing while at some level knowing it to be false. This paradoxical state suggests that self-deception is not merely a cognitive failure, but a sophisticated psychological maneuver.

As a defensive strategy, self-deception functions to protect the individual from psychological distress by suppressing truths that are too threatening to accept consciously. This aligns with psychoanalytic perspectives where the psyche deploys defense mechanisms to guard against anxiety and internal conflict. By distorting reality, self-deception helps maintain self-esteem and coherence of the self-concept, even at the expense of objective truth.

Structurally, self-deception can be seen as a feature of the psyche that facilitates the ongoing negotiation between conflicting desires, values, and the reality principle. It reflects the bifurcated nature of the human mind, capable of compartmentalizing incompatible beliefs and desires to sustain a functional equilibrium. This structural aspect is evident in the way self-deception allows for the coexistence of the conscious and unconscious mind, where one part of the psyche is aware of the truth that another part is actively denying.

Ultimately, understanding self-deception requires acknowledging its multifaceted nature. It is not solely a failure of cognition or a mere defense but an intrinsic part of the human psychological architecture that allows individuals to navigate the complexities of internal and external demands. This understanding underscores the necessity of integrating cognitive, psychoanalytic, and structural perspectives to fully grasp the phenomenon of self-deception.
