              In 1827 Gauss presented to the Royal Society of Göttingen his important paper

        on the theory of surfaces, which seventy-three years afterward the eminent French

      geometer, who has done more than any one else to propagate these principles,

      characterizes as one of Gauss’s chief titles to fame, and as still the most  nished
                                                               
        and useful introduction to the study of in nitesimal geometry.This memoir may

      be called: General Investigations of Curved Surfaces, or the Paper of 1827, to

      distinguish it from the original draft written out in 1825, but not published

      until 1900. A list of the editions and translations of the Paper of 1827 follows.

      There are three editions in Latin, two translations into French, and two into

          German. The paper was originally published in Latin under the title:

        Ia. Disquisitiones generales circa super cies curvas

              auctore Carolo Friderico Gauss.

                  Societati regiæ oblatæ D. 8. Octob. 1827,

        and was printed in: Commentationes societatis regiæ scientiarum Gottingensis

        recentiores, Commentationes classis mathematicæ. Tom. VI. (ad a. 1823–1827).

      Gottingæ, 1828, pages 99–146. This sixth volume is rare; so much so, indeed,

        that the British Museum Catalogue indicates that it is missing in that collection.

      With the signatures changed, and the paging changed to pages 1–50, Ia also

    appears with the title page added:

      Ib. Disquisitiones generales circa super cies curvas

              auctore Carolo Friderico Gauss.

            II. In Monge’s Application de l’analyse à la géométrie,  fth edition, edited

      by Liouville, Paris, 1850, on pages 505–546, is a reprint, added by the Editor,

        in Latin under the title: Recherches sur la théorie générale des surfaces courbes;

  Par M. C.-F. Gauss.

                    The English translation of the Paper of 1827 here given is from a copy of

                  the original paper, Ia; but in the preparation of the translation and the notes

                  all the other editions, except Va, were at hand, and were used. The excellent

              edition of Professor Wangerin, VII, has been used throughout most freely for the

                text and notes, even when special notice of this is not made. It has been the

              endeavor of the translators to retain as far as possible the notation, the form and

            punctuation of the formulæ, and the general style of the original papers. Some

            changes have been made in order to conform to more recent notations, and the

          most important of those are mentioned in the notes.

                    The second paper, the translation of which is here given, is the abstract

              (Anzeige) which Gauss presented in German to the Royal Society of Göttingen,

                  and which was published in the Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen. Stück 177.

            Pages 1761–1768. 1827. November 5. It has been translated into English from

                  pages 341–347 of the fourth volume of Gauss’s Works. This abstract is in the

                nature of a note on the Paper of 1827, and is printed before the notes on that

        paper.

                  Recently the eighth volume of Gauss’s Works has appeared. This contains on

                  pages 408–442 the paper which Gauss wrote out, but did not publish, in 1825.

              This paper may be called the New General Investigations of Curved Surfaces, or

                  the Paper of 1825, to distinguish it from the Paper of 1827. The Paper of 1825

              shows the manner in which many of the ideas were evolved, and while incomplete

              and in some cases inconsistent, nevertheless, when taken in connection with the

                  Paper of 1827, shows the development of these ideas in the mind of Gauss. In

              both papers are found the method of the spherical representation, and, as types,

              the three important theorems: The measure of curvature is equal to the product

            of the reciprocals of the principal radii of curvature of the surface, The measure

                  of curvature remains unchanged by a mere bending of the surface, The excess

                of the sum of the angles of a geodesic triangle is measured by the area of the

              corresponding triangle on the auxiliary sphere. But in the Paper of 1825 the  rst

              six sections, more than one- fth of the whole paper, take up the consideration of

              theorems on curvature in a plane, as an introduction, before the ideas are used in                                  introduction.v


        space; whereas the Paper of 1827 takes up these ideas for space only. Moreover,

      while Gauss introduces the geodesic polar coordinates in the Paper of 1825, in

      the Paper of 1827 he uses the general coordinates, p, q, thus introducing a new

    method, as well as employing the principles used by Monge and others.

            The publication of this translation has been made possible by the liberality of

        the Princeton Library Publishing Association and of the Alumni of the University

    who founded the Mathematical Seminary.

                          KARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS

                    PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY, OCTOBER 8, 1827




                                        1.

            Investigations, in which the directions of various straight lines in space are

      to be considered, attain a high degree of clearness and simplicity if we employ,

        as an auxiliary, a sphere of unit radius described about an arbitrary centre, and

        suppose the di erent points of the sphere to represent the directions of straight

      lines parallel to the radii ending at these points. As the position of every point

      in space is determined by three coordinates, that is to say, the distances of the

        point from three mutually perpendicular  xed planes, it is necessary to consider,

       rst of all, the directions of the axes perpendicular to these planes. The points

      on the sphere, which represent these directions, we shall denote by (1), (2), (3).

      The distance of any one of these points from either of the other two will be a

        quadrant; and we shall suppose that the directions of the axes are those in which

      the corresponding coordinates increase.


                                        2.

            It will be advantageous to bring together here some propositions which are

    frequently used in questions of this kind.


            I. The angle between two intersecting straight lines is measured by the arc

        between the points on the sphere which correspond to the directions of the lines.


          II. The orientation of any plane whatever can be represented by the great

        circle on the sphere, the plane of which is parallel to the given plane.


          III. The angle between two planes is equal to the spherical angle between

        the great circles representing them, and, consequently, is also measured by the

        arc intercepted between the poles of these great circles. And, in like manner, the

      angle of inclination of a straight line to a plane is measured by the arc drawn

      from the point which corresponds to the direction of the line, perpendicular to

      the great circle which represents the orientation of the plane.          4karl friedrich gauss


                                    000
                  IV. Letting x, y, z; x, y, zdenote the coordinates of two points, r the

                  distance between them, and L the point on the sphere which represents the

                direction of the line drawn from the  rst point to the second, we shall have

                                        0
                                        x= x + rcos(1)L;
                                        0
                                        y= y + rcos(2)L;
                                        0
                                        z= z + rcos(3)L:


              V. From this it follows at once that, generally,

                                  222
                                  cos(1)L + cos(2)L + cos(3)L = 1;

                    0
              and also, if Ldenote any other point on the sphere,

                              0000
                  cos(1)L   cos(1)L+ cos(2)L   cos(2)L+ cos(3)L   cos(3)L= cosLL:

                                    000000
                    VI. Theorem. If L, L, L, Ldenote four points on the sphere, and A the
                                000000
                  angle which the arcs LL, LLmake at their point of intersection, then we shall

        have

                  cosLL  cosLL cosLL  cosLL= sinLL  sinLL  cosA:


                Demonstration. Let A denote also the point of intersection itself, and set

                            AL = t; AL= t; AL= t; AL= t:

          Then we shall have

                                  000000
                              cosLL= cost cost+ sint sintcosA;
                                000000000000

                                000000000
                              cosLL= costcost+ sintsintcosA;

          and consequently,

                                              000000000000
                                                                                      y
                                  = cosA(costsint sintcost)(costsint sintcost)
                                          000000
                              = cosA   sin(t t)   sin(t t)
                                            000000
                              = cosA   sinLL  sinLL:

                  But as there are for each great circle two branches going out from the point A,
                                                                               
                these two branches form at this point two angles whose sum is 180. But our

                  analysis shows that those branches are to be taken whose directions are in the                      general investigations of curved surfaces5


                              000000
        sense from the point L to L, and from the point Lto L; and since great

      circles intersect in two points, it is clear that either of the two points can be

      chosen arbitrarily. Also, instead of the angle A, we can take the arc between
                                                    000000
          the poles of the great circles of which the arcs LL, LLare parts. But it is

        evident that those poles are to be chosen which are similarly placed with respect
                                                      000000
    to these arcs; that is to say, when we go from L to Land from Lto L, both

    of the two poles are to be on the right, or both on the left.


                  000
        VII. Let L, L, Lbe the three points on the sphere and set, for brevity,

                    cos(1)L = x; cos(2)L = y; cos(3)L = z;
                        000000
                    cos(1)L= x; cos(2)L= y; cos(3)L= z;
                          000000000000
                    cos(1)L= x; cos(2)L= y; cos(3)L= z;



and also
                  000000000000000000
                  xyz+ xyz + xyz xyz xyz xyz =  :

                                                      0
      Let   denote the pole of the great circle of which LLis a part, this pole being

    the one that is placed in the same position with respect to this arc as the

      point (1) is with respect to the arc (2)(3). Then we shall have, by the preceding

theorem,
                        000
                        yz yz = cos(1)    sin(2)(3)   sinLL;

                       
or, because (2)(3) = 90,

                            000
                            yz yz = cos(1)    sinLL;


and similarly,

                            000
                            zx zx = cos(2)    sinLL;
                            000
                            xy xy = cos(3)    sinLL:

                                  000000
      Multiplying these equations by x, y, zrespectively, and adding, we obtain,

    by means of the second of the theorems deduced in V,

                                          000
                                  = cos L  sinLL:

                                                              00
      Now there are three cases to be distinguished. First, when Llies on the great
                          000 
      circle of which the arc LLis a part, we shall have  L= 90, and consequently,
            0000
      = 0. If Ldoes not lie on that great circle, the second case will be when Lis

      on the same side as  ; the third case when they are on opposite sides. In the last
                          000
      two cases the points L, L, Lwill form a spherical triangle, and in the second

      case these points will lie in the same order as the points (1), (2), (3), and in the

      opposite order in the third case. Denoting the angles of this triangle simply by          6karl friedrich gauss


            00000
                L, L, Land the perpendicular drawn on the sphere from the point Lto the
              0
          side LLby p, we shall have

                                                  000000
                                sinp = sinL   sinLL= sinL  sinLL;

        and
                                            00 
                                           L= 90  p;

                  the upper sign being taken for the second case, the lower for the third. From

          this it follows that

                                        00000000
                             = sinL   sinLL  sinLL= sinL  sinLL  sinLL
                                0000000
                            = sinL  sinLL  sinLL:

                  Moreover, it is evident that the  rst case can be regarded as contained in the

              second or third, and it is easily seen that the expression    represents six times
                                                              000
                  the volume of the pyramid formed by the points L, L, Land the centre of the
                                                                  1
                                                                        expresses generally
            sphere. Whence,  nally, it is clear that the expression  
                                                                  6
              the volume of any pyramid contained between the origin of coordinates and the
                                                      000000000
            three points whose coordinates are x, y, z; x, y, z; x, y, z.


                                                3.

                  A curved surface is said to possess continuous curvature at one of its points A,

                  if the directions of all the straight lines drawn from A to points of the surface

              at an in nitely small distance from A are de ected in nitely little from one and

                the same plane passing through A. This plane is said to touch the surface at

                  the point A. If this condition is not satis ed for any point, the continuity of the

                  curvature is here interrupted, as happens, for example, at the vertex of a cone.

              The following investigations will be restricted to such surfaces, or to such parts

              of surfaces, as have the continuity of their curvature nowhere interrupted. We

                  shall only observe now that the methods used to determine the position of the

            tangent plane lose their meaning at singular points, in which the continuity of

                the curvature is interrupted, and must lead to indeterminate solutions.


                                                4.

                  The orientation of the tangent plane is most conveniently studied by means

                  of the direction of the straight line normal to the plane at the point A, which is

                  also called the normal to the curved surface at the point A. We shall represent

                  the direction of this normal by the point L on the auxiliary sphere, and we shall

        set

                              cos(1)L = X; cos(2)L = Y; cos(3)L = Z;

                and denote the coordinates of the point A by x, y, z. Also let x + dx, y + dy,
                                                        0
                z + dz be the coordinates of another point Aon the curved surface; ds its                      general investigations of curved surfaces7


      distance from A, which is in nitely small; and  nally, let   be the point on the
                                                    0
      sphere representing the direction of the element AA. Then we shall have

                  dx = ds   cos(1) ; dy = ds   cos(2) ; dz = ds   cos(3) 

                                   
    and, since  L must be equal to 90,

                        X cos(1)  + Y cos(2)  + Z cos(3)  = 0:

    By combining these equations we obtain

                              X dx + Y dy + Z dz = 0:

            There are two general methods for de ning the nature of a curved surface.

        The  rst uses the equation between the coordinates x, y, z, which we may suppose

      reduced to the form W = 0, where W will be a function of the indeterminates

    x, y, z. Let the complete di erential of the function W be

                              dW = P dx + Q dy + R dz

    and on the curved surface we shall have

                              P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0;

and consequently,

                        P cos(1)  + Qcos(2)  + Rcos(3)  = 0:

      Since this equation, as well as the one we have established above, must be true

      for the directions of all elements ds on the curved surface, we easily see that

      X, Y , Z must be proportional to P, Q, R respectively, and consequently, since

                                222
                                                  y
                                X+ Y+ Z= 1;

  we shall have either

                                          QR
                P
          p;p;p
    X =
                               Y = Z =
              222222222

or

                  PQR
        p;p;p:
    X = Y = Z =
              222222222
              P+ Q+ RP+ Q+ RP+ Q+ R

            The second method expresses the coordinates in the form of functions of two

        variables, p, q. Suppose that di erentiation of these functions gives

                                              0
                                dx = a dp + a
                                              dq;
                                              0
                                  dy = b dp + bdq;
                                              0
                                dz = c dp + cdq:          8karl friedrich gauss


            Substituting these values in the formula given above, we obtain

                                                000
                              (aX + bY + cZ)dp + (aX + bY + cZ)dq = 0:

                  Since this equation must hold independently of the values of the di erentials

          dp, dq, we evidently shall have

                                                  000
                              aX + bY + cZ = 0; aX + bY + cZ = 0:

              From this we see that X, Y , Z will be proportioned to the quantities

                                  000000
                                  bc cb; ca ac; ab ba:

          Hence, on setting, for brevity,

                        p
                              002002002
                              (bc cb)+ (ca ac)+ (ab ba)=  ;

        we shall have either

                        000000
                        bc cbca acab ba

        or

                        cb bcac caba ab
                  X =; Y =; Z =:
                           

                With these two general methods is associated a third, in which one of the

                  coordinates, z, say, is expressed in the form of a function of the other two, x, y.

                  This method is evidently only a particular case either of the  rst method, or of

        the second. If we set

                                          dz = t dx + u dy

        we shall have either

                  The two solutions found in the preceding article evidently refer to opposite

                  points of the sphere, or to opposite directions, as one would expect, since the

                  normal may be drawn toward either of the two sides of the curved surface. If we

              wish to distinguish between the two regions bordering upon the surface, and call

                  one the exterior region and the other the interior region, we can then assign to                      general investigations of curved surfaces9


      each of the two normals its appropriate solution by aid of the theorem derived

      in Art. 2 (VII), and at the same time establish a criterion for distinguishing the

one region from the other.

        In the  rst method, such a criterion is to be drawn from the sign of the

        quantity W. Indeed, generally speaking, the curved surface divides those regions

      of space in which W keeps a positive value from those in which the value of W

      becomes negative. In fact, it is easily seen from this theorem that, if W takes

      a positive value toward the exterior region, and if the normal is supposed to be

      drawn outwardly, the  rst solution is to be taken. Moreover, it will be easy to

      decide in any case whether the same rule for the sign of W is to hold throughout

      the entire surface, or whether for di erent parts there will be di erent rules. As

      long as the coe cients P, Q, R have  nite values and do not all vanish at the

    same time, the law of continuity will prevent any change.

            If we follow the second method, we can imagine two systems of curved lines

      on the curved surface, one system for which p is variable, q constant; the other

      for which q is variable, p constant. The respective positions of these lines with

      reference to the exterior region will decide which of the two solutions must be

      taken. In fact, whenever the three lines, namely, the branch of the line of the

      former system going out from the point A as p increases, the branch of the

    line of the latter system going out from the point A as q increases, and the

      normal drawn toward the exterior region, are similarly placed as the x, y, z

      axes respectively from the origin of abscissas (e. g., if, both for the former three

      lines and for the latter three, we can conceive the  rst directed to the left, the

      second to the right, and the third upward), the  rst solution is to be taken.

      But whenever the relative position of the three lines is opposite to the relative

    position of the x, y, z axes, the second solution will hold.

          In the third method, it is to be seen whether, when z receives a positive

        increment, x and y remaining constant, the point crosses toward the exterior or

      the interior region. In the former case, for the normal drawn outward, the  rst

    solution holds; in the latter case, the second.


                                        6.

          Just as each de nite point on the curved surface is made to correspond to a

        de nite point on the sphere, by the direction of the normal to the curved surface

      which is transferred to the surface of the sphere, so also any line whatever, or

      any  gure whatever, on the latter will be represented by a corresponding line

      or  gure on the former. In the comparison of two  gures corresponding to one

      another in this way, one of which will be as the map of the other, two important

      points are to be considered, one when quantity alone is considered, the other

      when, disregarding quantitative relations, position alone is considered.

          The  rst of these important points will be the basis of some ideas which

      it seems judicious to introduce into the theory of curved surfaces. Thus, to

      each part of a curved surface inclosed within de nite limits we assign a total or

      integral curvature, which is represented by the area of the  gure on the sphere          10karl friedrich gauss


                  corresponding to it. From this integral curvature must be distinguished the

              somewhat more speci c curvature which we shall call the measure of curvature.

              The latter refers to a point of the surface, and shall denote the quotient obtained

                  when the integral curvature of the surface element about a point is divided by

              the area of the element itself; and hence it denotes the ratio of the in nitely small

              areas which correspond to one another on the curved surface and on the sphere.

                  The use of these innovations will be abundantly justi ed, as we hope, by what

                  we shall explain below. As for the terminology, we have thought it especially

                  desirable that all ambiguity be avoided. For this reason we have not thought

                  it advantageous to follow strictly the analogy of the terminology commonly

              adopted (though not approved by all) in the theory of plane curves, according to

              which the measure of curvature should be called simply curvature, but the total

            curvature, the amplitude. But why not be free in the choice of words, provided

                they are not meaningless and not liable to a misleading interpretation?

                      The position of a  gure on the sphere can be either similar to the position

                  of the corresponding  gure on the curved surface, or opposite (inverse). The

                  former is the case when two lines going out on the curved surface from the same

              point in di erent, but not opposite directions, are represented on the sphere by

                lines similarly placed, that is, when the map of the line to the right is also to

                  the right; the latter is the case when the contrary holds. We shall distinguish

                  these two cases by the positive or negative sign of the measure of curvature.

                  But evidently this distinction can hold only when on each surface we choose a

                  de nite face on which we suppose the  gure to lie. On the auxiliary sphere we

                  shall use always the exterior face, that is, that turned away from the centre; on

                  the curved surface also there may be taken for the exterior face the one already

            considered, or rather that face from which the normal is supposed to be drawn.

                  For, evidently, there is no change in regard to the similitude of the  gures, if on

              the curved surface both the  gure and the normal be transferred to the opposite

                side, so long as the image itself is represented on the same side of the sphere.

                The positive or negative sign, which we assign to the measure of curvature

                  according to the position of the in nitely small  gure, we extend also to the

                  integral curvature of a  nite  gure on the curved surface. However, if we wish

                  to discuss the general case, some explanations will be necessary, which we can

                only touch here brie y. So long as the  gure on the curved surface is such

                  that to distinct points on itself there correspond distinct points on the sphere,

              the de nition needs no further explanation. But whenever this condition is not

            satis ed, it will be necessary to take into account twice or several times certain

                parts of the  gure on the sphere. Whence for a similar, or inverse position,

              may arise an accumulation of areas, or the areas may partially or wholly destroy

                each other. In such a case, the simplest way is to suppose the curved surface

              divided into parts, such that each part, considered separately, satis es the above

              condition; to assign to each of the parts its integral curvature, determining this

              magnitude by the area of the corresponding  gure on the sphere, and the sign by

                  the position of this  gure; and,  nally, to assign to the total  gure the integral

              curvature arising from the addition of the integral curvatures which correspond to                      general investigations of curved surfaces11

                                                                          R
      the single parts. So, generally, the integral curvature of a  gure is equal tok d ,

      d  denoting the element of area of the  gure, and k the measure of curvature at

        any point. The principal points concerning the geometric representation of this

      integral reduce to the following. To the perimeter of the  gure on the curved

      surface (under the restriction of Art. 3) will correspond always a closed line on

      the sphere. If the latter nowhere intersect itself, it will divide the whole surface

      of the sphere into two parts, one of which will correspond to the  gure on the

      curved surface; and its area (taken as positive or negative according as, with

      respect to its perimeter, its position is similar, or inverse, to the position of the

       gure on the curved surface) will represent the integral curvature of the  gure

      on the curved surface. But whenever this line intersects itself once or several

        times, it will give a complicated  gure, to which, however, it is possible to assign

    a de nite area as legitimately as in the case of a  gure without nodes; and

      this area, properly interpreted, will give always an exact value for the integral

      curvature. However, we must reserve for another occasion the more extended

        exposition of the theory of these  gures viewed from this very general standpoint.


                                        7.

            We shall now  nd a formula which will express the measure of curvature for

    any point of a curved surface. Let d  denote the area of an element of this

      surface; then Z d  will be the area of the projection of this element on the plane

      of the coordinates x, y; and consequently, if d  is the area of the corresponding

      element on the sphere, Z d  will be the area of its projection on the same plane.

      The positive or negative sign of Z will, in fact, indicate that the position of

      the projection is similar or inverse to that of the projected element. Evidently

      these projections have the same ratio as to quantity and the same relation as to

        position as the elements themselves. Let us consider now a triangular element on

      the curved surface, and let us suppose that the coordinates of the three points

  which form its projection are

                                x; y;

                                  x + dx; y + dy;

                                  x +  x; y +  y:

        The double area of this triangle will be expressed by the formula

                                  dx    y dy    x;

      and this will be in a positive or negative form according as the position of the

      side from the  rst point to the third, with respect to the side from the  rst point

      to the second, is similar or opposite to the position of the y-axis of coordinates

    with respect to the x-axis of coordinates.

            In like manner, if the coordinates of the three points which form the projection

      of the corresponding element on the sphere, from the centre of the sphere as          12karl friedrich gauss


        origin, are

                                      X; Y;

                                        X + dX; Y + dY;

                                        X +  X; Y +  Y;

            the double area of this projection will be expressed by

                                        dX    Y dY    X;

                and the sign of this expression is determined in the same manner as above.

                  Wherefore the measure of curvature at this point of the curved surface will be

                                          dX    Y dY    X
                                    k =:
                                            dx    y dy    x

                  If now we suppose the nature of the curved surface to be de ned according to

                  the third method considered in Art. 4, X and Y will be in the form of functions

            of the quantities x, y. We shall have, therefore,

      Substituting these values in the above expression, it becomes

          By a suitable choice of origin and axes of coordinates, we can easily make

      the values of the quantities t, u, U vanish for a de nite point A. Indeed, the

       rst two conditions will be ful lled at once if the tangent plane at this point be

      taken for the xy-plane. If, further, the origin is placed at the point A itself, the

    expression for the coordinate z evidently takes the form

      it is easily seen that there must result an equation of the form

                                      22

          the coordinates z are positive.

        y-axis and the z-axis.


                III. Setting z = rcos , y = rsin , the equation becomes

                                            222

                from which we see that if the section is made by a plane through the normal

                  at A and making an angle   with the x-axis, we shall have a plane curve whose

          radius of curvature at the point A will be

                                                1
                                                          :

                    IV. Therefore, whenever we have T = V , the radii of curvature in all the

                  normal planes will be equal. But if T and V are not equal, it is evident that, since
                                                              2
                                                    2
                for any value whatever of the angle  , T cos +V sin  falls between T and V ,

                  the radii of curvature in the principal sections considered in I. and II. refer to

                  the extreme curvatures; that is to say, the one to the maximum curvature, the

                other to the minimum, if T and V have the same sign. On the other hand,

              one has the greatest convex curvature, the other the greatest concave curvature,

                  if T and V have opposite signs. These conclusions contain almost all that the

                illustrious Euler was the  rst to prove on the curvature of curved surfaces.


                V. The measure of curvature at the point A on the curved surface takes the

          very simple form

                                            k = T V;

        whence we have the

                Theorem. The measure of curvature at any point whatever of the surface

                  is equal to a fraction whose numerator is unity, and whose denominator is the

                  product of the two extreme radii of curvature of the sections by normal planes.

                    At the same time it is clear that the measure of curvature is positive for

              concavo-concave or convexo-convex surfaces (which distinction is not essential),

              but negative for concavo-convex surfaces. If the surface consists of parts of each

              kind, then on the lines separating the two kinds the measure of curvature ought

            to vanish. Later we shall make a detailed study of the nature of curved surfaces

              for which the measure of curvature everywhere vanishes.                      general investigations of curved surfaces15

          The general formula for the measure of curvature given at the end of Art. 7

      is the most simple of all, since it involves only  ve elements. We shall arrive at

      a more complicated formula, indeed, one involving nine elements, if we wish to

      use the  rst method of representing a curved surface. Keeping the notation of

Art. 4, let us set also

    320002000000200
    Rdt = (RP+ 2P RQ PR)dx + (P RP+ QRQ P QR RR)dy:


  In like manner we obtain

    300000200200020
      Rdu = (P RP+ QRQ P QR RR)dx + (RQ+ 2QRP QR)dy:


  From this we conclude that

                      3200020
                      RT = RP+ 2P RQ PR;

                      RV = RQ+ 2QRP QR:


      Substituting these values in the formula of Art. 7, we obtain for the measure of

      curvature k the following symmetric expression:

                We obtain a still more complicated formula, indeed, one involving  fteen

                elements, if we follow the second general method of de ning the nature of a

              curved surface. It is, however, very important that we develop this formula also.

            Thus, inasmuch as z may be regarded as a function of x, y, we have

              is done by multiplying them by bc cb, bC cB, cB bC respectively and

          adding. In this way we obtain

          an equation which is easily transformed into

          Multiplying these three equations by

                                              000
      and after these equations are multiplied by  , , respectively, addition gives

                is the general expression for the linear element on the curved surface. The

                  analysis developed in the preceding article thus shows us that for  nding the

                measure of curvature there is no need of  nite formulæ, which express the

                  coordinates x, y, z as functions of the indeterminates p, q; but that the general

            expression for the magnitude of any linear element is su cient. Let us proceed

            to some applications of this very important theorem.

                  Suppose that our surface can be developed upon another surface, curved or

              plane, so that to each point of the former surface, determined by the coordinates

                  x, y, z, will correspond a de nite point of the latter surface, whose coordinates
              000000
            are x, y, z. Evidently x, y, zcan also be regarded as functions of the
                                                            p
                                                                  020202
                                                                      + dy+ dzwe shall
            indeterminates p, q, and therefore for the elementdx

          have an expression of the form

                                p
                                      02002

                000
              where E, F, Galso denote functions of p, q. But from the very notion

                of the development of one surface upon another it is clear that the elements

              corresponding to one another on the two surfaces are necessarily equal. Therefore

          we shall have identically

                                        000
                                    E = E; F = F; G = G:

                Thus the formula of the preceding article leads of itself to the remarkable

                  Theorem. If a curved surface is developed upon any other surface whatever,

              the measure of curvature in each point remains unchanged.

                  Also it is evident that any  nite part whatever of the curved surface will retain

              the same integral curvature after development upon another surface.

                Surfaces developable upon a plane constitute the particular case to which

              geometers have heretofore restricted their attention. Our theory shows at once

                  that the measure of curvature at every point of such surfaces is equal to zero.

                  Consequently, if the nature of these surfaces is de ned according to the third

          method, we shall have at every point

                  a criterion which, though indeed known a short time ago, has not, at least to

              our knowledge, commonly been demonstrated with as much rigor as is desirable.                      general investigations of curved surfaces21

            What we have explained in the preceding article is connected with a particular

      method of studying surfaces, a very worthy method which may be thoroughly

      developed by geometers. When a surface is regarded, not as the boundary of a

      solid, but as a  exible, though not extensible solid, one dimension of which is

      supposed to vanish, then the properties of the surface depend in part upon the

      form to which we can suppose it reduced, and in part are absolute and remain

      invariable, whatever may be the form into which the surface is bent. To these

      latter properties, the study of which opens to geometry a new and fertile  eld,

      belong the measure of curvature and the integral curvature, in the sense which

      we have given to these expressions. To these belong also the theory of shortest

      lines, and a great part of what we reserve to be treated later. From this point

      of view, a plane surface and a surface developable on a plane, e. g., cylindrical

      surfaces, conical surfaces, etc., are to be regarded as essentially identical; and

      the generic method of de ning in a general manner the nature of the surfaces

      thus considered is always based upon the formula
                          p
                                22
                                E dp+ 2F dp   dq + G dq;

        which connects the linear element with the two indeterminates p, q. But before

      following this study further, we must introduce the principles of the theory of

    shortest lines on a given curved surface.


                                        14.

            The nature of a curved line in space is generally given in such a way that the

      coordinates x, y, z corresponding to the di erent points of it are given in the

      form of functions of a single variable, which we shall call w. The length of such

      a line from an arbitrary initial point to the point whose coordinates are x, y, z,

  is expressed by the integral
                            s
                                      
                    Z
                                      222
                                  dxdydz

                                  dwdwdw

        If we suppose that the position of the line undergoes an in nitely small variation,

      so that the coordinates of the di erent points receive the variations  x,  y,  z,

  the variation of the whole length becomes
                        Z
                              dx   d  x + dy   d  y + dz   d  z

                  We know that, in case the line is to be the shortest between its end points, all

                  that stands under the integral sign must vanish. Since the line must lie on the

            given surface, whose nature is de ned by the equation

                                      P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0;

            the variations  x,  y,  z also must satisfy the equation

                                      P  x + Q  y + R  z = 0;

                  and from this it follows at once, according to well-known rules, that the di er-

        entials

                          dxdydz

                must be proportional to the quantities P, Q, R respectively. Let dr be the

            element of the curved line;   the point on the sphere representing the direction

              of this element; L the point on the sphere representing the direction of the normal

                to the curved surface;  nally, let  ,  ,   be the coordinates of the point  , and

                X, Y , Z be those of the point L with reference to the centre of the sphere. We

        shall then have

                                dx =   dr; dy =   dr; dz =   dr;

                  from which we see that the above di erentials become d , d , d . And since the

                  quantities P, Q, R are proportional to X, Y , Z, the character of shortest lines

          is expressed by the equations

                                                d d 
                                        d 
                                            ==:
                                          XYZ

          Moreover, it is easily seen that

                                        p
                                            222
                                          d + d + d 

                  is equal to the small arc on the sphere which measures the angle between the

                directions of the tangents at the beginning and at the end of the element dr,
                            dr
        and is thus equal to, if  
                                             denotes the radius of curvature of the shortest line
                               
          at this point. Thus we shall have

                                d  = X dr;   d  = Y dr;   d  = Z dr:


                                              15.

                  Suppose that an in nite number of shortest lines go out from a given point A

                  on the curved surface, and suppose that we distinguish these lines from one

                  another by the angle that the  rst element of each of them makes with the  rst

                element of one of them which we take for the  rst. Let   be that angle, or,                      general investigations of curved surfaces23


      more generally, a function of that angle, and r the length of such a shortest line

      from the point A to the point whose coordinates are x, y, z. Since to de nite

      values of the variables r,   there correspond de nite points of the surface, the

      coordinates x, y, z can be regarded as functions of r,  . We shall retain for the

    notation  , L,  ,  ,  , X, Y , Z the same meaning as in the preceding article,

      this notation referring to any point whatever on any one of the shortest lines.

          All the shortest lines that are of the same length r will end on another line

      whose length, measured from an arbitrary initial point, we shall denote by v.
                                                                        0
      Thus v can be regarded as a function of the indeterminates r,  , and if  denotes

      the point on the sphere corresponding to the direction of the element dv, and
    000
      also  ,  ,  denote the coordinates of this point with reference to the centre of

                  length be drawn from the same initial point, the lines joining their extremities

          will be normal to each of the lines.

                  We have thought it worth while to deduce this theorem from the fundamental

                  property of shortest lines; but the truth of the theorem can be made apparent
                                                                                      0
                  without any calculation by means of the following reasoning. Let AB, ABbe

                  two shortest lines of the same length including at A an in nitely small angle,
                                                                                0
                and let us suppose that one of the angles made by the element BBwith the
                    0
                  lines BA, BA di ers from a right angle by a  nite quantity. Then, by the law

                  of continuity, one will be greater and the other less than a right angle. Suppose
                                     
                the angle at B is equal to 90!, and take on the line AB a point C, such that

                                                0
                                        BC = BB  cosec!:

                                                      0
                  Then, since the in nitely small triangle BBC may be regarded as plane, we

        shall have
                                          0
                                        CB= BC   cos!;

        and consequently

                  00
            AC +CB= AC +BC  cos! = AB BC  (1cos!) = ABBC  (1cos!);

                                    0
                i. e., the path from A to Bthrough the point C is shorter than the shortest

        line, Q. E. A.


                                              16.

                With the theorem of the preceding article we associate another, which we

                  state as follows: If on a curved surface we imagine any line whatever, from the

                  di erent points of which are drawn at right angles and toward the same side an

                  in nite number of shortest lines of the same length, the curve which joins their

              other extremities will cut each of the lines at right angles. For the demonstration

                  of this theorem no change need be made in the preceding analysis, except that

                    must denote the length of the given curve measured from an arbitrary point;

                  or rather, a function of this length. Thus all of the reasoning will hold here also,

                with this modi cation, that S = 0 for r = 0 is now implied in the hypothesis

                  itself. Moreover, this theorem is more general than the preceding one, for we

                  can regard it as including the  rst one if we take for the given line the in nitely

                  small circle described about the centre A. Finally, we may say that here also

              geometric considerations may take the place of the analysis, which, however, we

                shall not take the time to consider here, since they are su ciently obvious.                      general investigations of curved surfaces25


                                        17.

      We return to the formula

                          p
                                22
                                E dp+ 2F dp   dq + G dq;


        which expresses generally the magnitude of a linear element on the curved surface,

      and investigate,  rst of all, the geometric meaning of the coe cients E, F, G.

      We have already said in Art. 5 that two systems of lines may be supposed to

      lie on the curved surface, p being variable, q constant along each of the lines of

      the one system; and q variable, p constant along each of the lines of the other

      system. Any point whatever on the surface can be regarded as the intersection

    of a line of the  rst system with a line of the second; and then the element

      of the  rst line adjacent to this point and corresponding to a variation dp will
            p
                           dp, and the element of the second line corresponding to the
be equal toE
                              p
                                         dq. Finally, denoting by ! the angle between
    variation dq will be equal toG

      these elements, it is easily seen that we shall have

                                            F
                                          p
                                                :
                                  cos! =

      Furthermore, the area of the surface element in the form of a parallelogram

      between the two lines of the  rst system, to which correspond q, q +dq, and the

        two lines of the second system, to which correspond p, p + dp, will be

                              p

          Any line whatever on the curved surface belonging to neither of the two

    systems is determined when p and q are supposed to be functions of a new

      variable, or one of them is supposed to be a function of the other. Let s be the

      length of such a curve, measured from an arbitrary initial point, and in either

    direction chosen as positive. Let   denote the angle which the element

                            p
                                    22

      makes with the line of the  rst system drawn through the initial point of the

      element, and, in order that no ambiguity may arise, let us suppose that this

      angle is measured from that branch of the  rst line on which the values of p

      increase, and is taken as positive toward that side toward which the values of q

      increase. These conventions being made, it is easily seen that

                  We shall now investigate the condition that this line be a shortest line. Since

            its length s is expressed by the integral
                                  Z
                                      p

                              s =


            the condition for a minimum requires that the variation of this integral arising

                from an in nitely small change in the position become equal to zero. The

                calculation, for our purpose, is more simply made in this case, if we regard

              p as a function of q. When this is done, if the variation is denoted by the

          characteristic  , we have

      it is also possible to eliminate the angle  , and to derive a di erential equation

      of the second order between p and q, which, however, would become more

        complicated and less useful for applications than the preceding.

            The general formulæ, which we have derived in Arts. 11, 18 for the measure

      of curvature and the variation in the direction of a shortest line, become much

      simpler if the quantities p, q are so chosen that the lines of the  rst system cut

      everywhere orthogonally the lines of the second system; i. e., in such a way that
                           
          we have generally ! = 90, or F = 0. Then the formula for the measure of

  curvature becomes

            Among the various cases in which we have this condition of orthogonality,

      the most important is that in which all the lines of one of the two systems, e. g.,

      the  rst, are shortest lines. Here for a constant value of q the angle   becomes

      equal to zero, and therefore the equation for the variation of   just given shows
                    @E
                               0, or that the coe cient E must be independent of q;
  that we must have=
                    @q
      i. e., E must be either a constant or a function of p alone. It will be simplest to

      take for p the length of each line of the  rst system, which length, when all the

      lines of the  rst system meet in a point, is to be measured from this point, or, if

      there is no common intersection, from any line whatever of the second system.

      Having made these conventions, it is evident that p and q denote now the same

      quantities that were expressed in Arts. 15, 16 by r and  , and that E = 1. Thus

  the two preceding formulæ become:

                Generally speaking, m will be a function of p, q, and m dq the expression for

                  the element of any line whatever of the second system. But in the particular

                  case where all the lines p go out from the same point, evidently we must have

                  m = 0 for p = 0. Furthermore, in the case under discussion we will take for q the

              angle itself which the  rst element of any line whatever of the  rst system makes

                  with the element of any one of the lines chosen arbitrarily. Then, since for an

                  in nitely small value of p the element of a line of the second system (which can

                be regarded as a circle described with radius p) is equal to p dq, we shall have

                for an in nitely small value of p, m = p, and consequently, for p = 0, m = 0 at

                    We pause to investigate the case in which we suppose that p denotes in a

                  general manner the length of the shortest line drawn from a  xed point A to

                  any other point whatever of the surface, and q the angle that the  rst element

                of this line makes with the  rst element of another given shortest line going

                out from A. Let B be a de nite point in the latter line, for which q = 0, and

            C another de nite point of the surface, at which we denote the value of q simply

                by A. Let us suppose the points B, C joined by a shortest line, the parts of

                  which, measured from B, we denote in a general way, as in Art. 18, by s; and,

                  as in the same article, let us denote by   the angle which any element ds makes
                                                           0
                with the element dp;  nally, let us denote by  ,  the values of the angle  

                at the points B, C. We have thus on the curved surface a triangle formed by

                  shortest lines. The angles of this triangle at B and C we shall denote simply by
                                                     0
              the same letters, and B will be equal to 180  , C to  itself. But, since it is

                  easily seen from our analysis that all the angles are supposed to be expressed,
                                                                               000

                  which corresponds an arc equal to the radius, is taken for the unit, we must set

                                       0

                where 2  denotes the circumference of the sphere. Let us now examine the

              integral curvature of this triangle, which is equal to
                                            Z

                  d  denoting a surface element of the triangle. Wherefore, since this element is

              expressed by m dp   dq, we must extend the integral

                                  @q

      whence our expression is changed into dq + d . Now by a second integration,

      taken from q = 0 to q = A, we obtain for the integral curvature

                                        0

or

                                  A + B + C  :

          The integral curvature is equal to the area of that part of the sphere which

      corresponds to the triangle, taken with the positive or negative sign according

      as the curved surface on which the triangle lies is concavo-concave or concavo-

      convex. For unit area will be taken the square whose side is equal to unity (the

      radius of the sphere), and then the whole surface of the sphere becomes equal

      to 4 . Thus the part of the surface of the sphere corresponding to the triangle is

      to the whole surface of the sphere as  (A + B + C  ) is to 4 . This theorem,

      which, if we mistake not, ought to be counted among the most elegant in the

    theory of curved surfaces, may also be stated as follows:
                       
          The excess over 180of the sum of the angles of a triangle formed by shortest
                                                                     
      lines on a concavo-concave curved surface, or the de cit from 180of the sum

      of the angles of a triangle formed hy shortest lines on a concavo-convex curved

      surface, is measured by the area of the part of the sphere which corresponds,

      through the directions of the normals, to that triangle, if the whole surface of the

  sphere is set equal to 720 degrees.

            More generally, in any polygon whatever of n sides, each formed by a shortest

      line, the excess of the sum of the angles over (2n4) right angles, or the de cit

      from (2n 4) right angles (according to the nature of the curved surface), is

        equal to the area of the corresponding polygon on the sphere, if the whole surface

      of the sphere is set equal to 720 degrees. This follows at once from the preceding

    theorem by dividing the polygon into triangles.          30karl friedrich gauss

        Then the equation just found can be thrown into the following form:

                                    =E  dp  sinM+G  dq  sin(M+ !);

or

                                    =E  dp  sin(N !) +G  dq  sinN:

      And since the equation evidently must be independent of the initial direction,

      this direction can be chosen arbitrarily. Then, setting in the second formula
  00
      N= 0, or in the  rst M= 0, we obtain the following equations:
                          pp

                here also in such a way that, for any point whatever on the surface, r will be

                  the shortest distance from a  xed point, and   the angle at this point between

            the  rst element of r and a  xed direction. We have thus

            From these equations must be determined the quantities r,  ,   and (if

      need be) m, as functions of p and q. Indeed, integration of equation (5) will

      give r; r being found, integration of equation (6) will give  ; and one or other

  of equations (1), (2) will give   itself. Finally, m is obtained from one or other

  of equations (3), (4).

            The general integration of equations (5), (6) must necessarily introduce two

      arbitrary functions. We shall easily understand what their meaning is, if we

        remember that these equations are not limited to the case we are here considering,

      but are equally valid if r and   are taken in the more general sense of Art. 16, so

        that r is the length of the shortest line drawn normal to a  xed but arbitrary line,

      and   is an arbitrary function of the length of that part of the  xed line which is

        intercepted between any shortest line and an arbitrary  xed point. The general

        solution must embrace all this in a general way, and the arbitrary functions must

      go over into de nite functions only when the arbitrary line and the arbitrary

      functions of its parts, which   must represent, are themselves de ned. In our

      case an in nitely small circle may be taken, having its centre at the point from

      which the distances r are measured, and   will denote the parts themselves of

      this circle, divided by the radius. Whence it is easily seen that the equations

      (5), (6) are quite su cient for our case, provided that the functions which they

      leave unde ned satisfy the condition which r and   satisfy for the initial point

      and for points at an in nitely small distance from this point.

          Moreover, in regard to the integration itself of the equations (5), (6), we

        know that it can be reduced to the integration of ordinary di erential equations,

      which, however, often happen to be so complicated that there is little to be

        gained by the reduction. On the contrary, the development in series, which are

      abundantly su cient for practical requirements, when only a  nite portion of

        the surface is under consideration, presents no di culty; and the formulæ thus

        derived open a fruitful source for the solution of many important problems. But

      here we shall develop only a single example in order to show the nature of the

method.          34karl friedrich gauss


                                              23.

                    We shall now consider the case where all the lines for which p is constant

                  are shortest lines cutting orthogonally the line for which   = 0, which line we

                can regard as the axis of abscissas. Let A be the point for which r = 0, D any

                  point whatever on the axis of abscissas, AD = p, B any point whatever on the

                shortest line normal to AD at D, and BD = q, so that p can be regarded as

            the abscissa, q the ordinate of the point B. The abscissas we assume positive on

                  the branch of the axis of abscissas to which   = 0 corresponds, while we always

                  regard r as positive. We take the ordinates positive in the region in which   is
                                     
          measured between 0 and 180.

                By the theorem of Art. 16 we shall have

                                           
                                    ! = 90; F = 0; G = 1;

        and we shall set also
                                            p
                                              E = n:

                Thus n will be a function of p, q, such that for q = 0 it must become equal to

                  unity. The application of the formula of Art. 18 to our case shows that on any

          shortest line whatever we must have

                                              @n
                                                      y
                                                    dp;
                                          d  =
                                              @q

                  where   denotes the angle between the element of this line and the element of

            the line for which q is constant. Now since the axis of abscissas is itself a shortest

                line, and since, for it, we have everywhere   = 0, we see that for q = 0 we must

        have everywhere
                                            @n
                                                = 0:
                                            @q

                  Therefore we conclude that, if n is developed into a series in ascending powers

              of q, this series must have the following form:

                                            234
                                  n = 1 + f q+ gq+ hq+ etc.;

            where f, g, h, etc., will be functions of p, and we set

                                         0002
                                      f = f+ fp + fp+ etc.;

        The equations of Art. 22 give, in our case,

                                @r@ @ 
                @r
                    ; cos  =; ncos  = m  ; sin  = m  ;
      nsin  =

                        @r@ @r@ 
                                @r@r

                      @q@p@q@q@p@p

      By the aid of these equations, the  fth and sixth of which are contained in the

    others, series can be developed for r,  ,  , m, or for any functions whatever of

      these quantities. We are going to establish here those series that are especially

worthy of attention.

          Since for in nitely small values of p, q we must have

                                    222
                                  r= p+ q;

              222
      the series for rwill begin with the terms p+q. We obtain the terms of higher
                                                   
      order by the method of undetermined coe cients,by means of the equation

                            
                                    22
                                2
                                              2
                              @(r)
                                          @(r)
                          1
                                                        2

                          n@p@q

          These formulæ give the angle  . In like manner, for the calculation of the

                  angle  , series for rcos  and rsin  are very elegantly developed by means of

            the partial di erential equations

            From a combination of equations [2], [3], [4], [5] a series for rcos(  +  ), may

            be derived, and from this, dividing by the series [1], a series for cos(  + ), from

          which may be found a series for the angle   +  itself. However, the same series

              can be obtained more elegantly in the following manner. By di erentiating the

                   rst and second of the equations introduced at the beginning of this article, we

          It seems worth while also to develop the area of the triangle ABD into a

      series. For this development we may use the following conditional equation,

        which is easily derived from su ciently obvious geometric considerations, and in

  which S denotes the required area:

          From the formulæ of the preceding article, which refer to a right triangle

      formed by shortest lines, we proceed to the general case. Let C be another point

      on the same shortest line DB, for which point p remains the same as for the
              00000
  point B, and q, r,  ,  , Shave the same meanings as q, r,  ,  , S have for

      the point B. There will thus be a triangle between the points A, B, C, whose

    angles we denote by A, B, C, the sides opposite these angles by a, b, c, and

      the area by  . We represent the measure of curvature at the points A, B, C

      by  , ,  respectively. And then supposing (which is permissible) that the
                    0
  quantities p, q, q qare positive, we shall have

                    We shall  rst express the area   by a series. By changing in [7] each of the

                  quantities that refer to B into those that refer to C, we obtain a formula for S.

          The consideration of the rectilinear triangle whose sides are equal to a, b, c

      is of great advantage. The angles of this triangle, which we shall denote by
     
      A, B, C, di er from the angles of the triangle on the curved surface, namely,

      from A, B, C, by quantities of the second order; and it will be worth while to

      develop these di erences accurately. However, it will be su cient to show the

       rst steps in these more tedious than di cult calculations.

            Replacing in formulæ [1], [4], [5] the quantities that refer to B by those that
                                  020000
    refer to C, we get formulæ for r, rcos , rsin . Then the development of

      combined with the development of the expression

          Thus to the angles A, B, C on a non-spherical surface, unequal reductions

      must be applied, so that the sines of the changed angles become proportional

      to the sides opposite. The inequality, generally speaking, will be of the third

      order; but if the surface di ers little from a sphere, the inequality will be of a

        higher order. Even in the greatest triangles on the earth’s surface, whose angles

      it is possible to measure, the di erence can always be regarded as insensible.

      Thus, e. g., in the greatest of the triangles which we have measured in recent

        years, namely, that between the points Hohehagen, Brocken, Inselberg, where the
                                      00
      excess of the sum of the angles was 14:85348, the calculation gave the following

    reductions to be applied to the angles:

      surface with the area of the rectilinear triangle whose sides are a, b, c. We shall

                  It is easily veri ed that, with the same precision, the following formula may be

              If this formula is applied to triangles on non-spherical curved surfaces, the error,

              generally speaking, will be of the  fth order, but will be insensible in all triangles

            such as may be measured on the earth’s surface.              GAUSS’S ABSTRACT OF THE DISQUISITIONES GENERALES CIRCA
                  SUPERFICIES CURVAS, PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL
                              SOCIETY OF GÖTTINGEN.


          Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen. No. 177. Pages 1761–1768. 1827. November 5.


          On the 8th of October, Hofrath Gauss presented to the Royal Society a

paper:

                      Disquisitiones generales circa super cies curvas.

            Although geometers have given much attention to general investigations of

      curved surfaces and their results cover a signi cant portion of the domain of

      higher geometry, this subject is still so far from being exhausted, that it can

      well be said that, up to this time, but a small portion of an exceedingly fruitful

       eld has been cultivated. Through the solution of the problem, to  nd all

        representations of a given surface upon another in which the smallest elements

      remain unchanged, the author sought some years ago to give a new phase to

      this study. The purpose of the present discussion is further to open up other

      new points of view and to develop some of the new truths which thus become

      accessible. We shall here give an account of those things which can be made

      intelligible in a few words. But we wish to remark at the outset that the new

        theorems as well as the presentations of new ideas, if the greatest generality is to

        be attained, are still partly in need of some limitations or closer determinations,

  which must be omitted here.

          In researches in which an in nity of directions of straight lines in space is

      concerned, it is advantageous to represent these directions by means of those

      points upon a  xed sphere, which are the end points of the radii drawn parallel

      to the lines. The centre and the radius of this auxiliary sphere are here quite

      arbitrary. The radius may be taken equal to unity. This procedure agrees

        fundamentally with that which is constantly employed in astronomy, where all

        directions are referred to a  ctitious celestial sphere of in nite radius. Spherical

        trigonometry and certain other theorems, to which the author has added a new

      one of frequent application, then serve for the solution of the problems which

        the comparison of the various directions involved can present.

            If we represent the direction of the normal at each point of the curved surface

        by the corresponding point of the sphere, determined as above indicated, namely,

      in this way, to every point on the surface, let a point on the sphere correspond;

      then, generally speaking, to every line on the curved surface will correspond a

      line on the sphere, and to every part of the former surface will correspond a

      part of the latter. The less this part di ers from a plane, the smaller will be

      the corresponding part on the sphere. It is, therefore, a very natural idea to use

      as the measure of the total curvature, which is to be assigned to a part of the

        curved surface, the area of the corresponding part of the sphere. For this reason

        the author calls this area the integral curvature of the corresponding part of the          44gauss’s abstract.


              curved surface. Besides the magnitude of the part, there is also at the same time

                  its position to be considered. And this position may be in the two parts similar

              or inverse, quite independently of the relation of their magnitudes. The two cases

              can be distinguished by the positive or negative sign of the total curvature. This

              distinction has, however, a de nite meaning only when the  gures are regarded as

            upon de nite sides of the two surfaces. The author regards the  gure in the case

                  of the sphere on the outside, and in the case of the curved surface on that side

                  upon which we consider the normals erected. It follows then that the positive

              sign is taken in the case of convexo-convex or concavo-concave surfaces (which

                  are not essentially di erent), and the negative in the case of concavo-convex

                  surfaces. If the part of the curved surface in question consists of parts of these

            di erent sorts, still closer de nition is necessary, which must be omitted here.

                  The comparison of the areas of two corresponding parts of the curved surface

              and of the sphere leads now (in the same manner as, e. g., from the comparison of

              volume and mass springs the idea of density) to a new idea. The author designates

            as measure of curvature at a point of the curved surface the value of the fraction

                  whose denominator is the area of the in nitely small part of the curved surface

                  at this point and whose numerator is the area of the corresponding part of the

                  surface of the auxiliary sphere, or the integral curvature of that element. It is

            clear that, according to the idea of the author, integral curvature and measure

                  of curvature in the case of curved surfaces are analogous to what, in the case of

              curved lines, are called respectively amplitude and curvature simply. He hesitates

              to apply to curved surfaces the latter expressions, which have been accepted more

              from custom than on account of  tness. Moreover, less depends upon the choice

                  of words than upon this, that their introduction shall be justi ed by pregnant

        theorems.

                  The solution of the problem, to  nd the measure of curvature at any point of

              a curved surface, appears in di erent forms according to the manner in which the

                  nature of the curved surface is given. When the points in space, in general, are

              distinguished by three rectangular coordinates, the simplest method is to express

            one coordinate as a function of the other two. In this way we obtain the simplest

                  expression for the measure of curvature. But, at the same time, there arises a

              remarkable relation between this measure of curvature and the curvatures of the

            curves formed by the intersections of the curved surface with planes normal to

            it. Euler, as is well known,  rst showed that two of these cutting planes which

                  intersect each other at right angles have this property, that in one is found the

                  greatest and in the other the smallest radius of curvature; or, more correctly,

                  that in them the two extreme curvatures are found. It will follow then from the

              above mentioned expression for the measure of curvature that this will be equal

              to a fraction whose numerator is unity and whose denominator is the product of

              the extreme radii of curvature. The expression for the measure of curvature will

                  be less simple, if the nature of the curved surface is determined by an equation

                in x, y, z. And it will become still more complex, if the nature of the curved

                  surface is given so that x, y, z are expressed in the form of functions of two new

              variables p, q. In this last case the expression involves  fteen elements, namely,                                gauss’s abstract.45


      the partial di erential coe cients of the  rst and second orders of x, y, z with

      respect to p and q. But it is less important in itself than for the reason that it

        facilitates the transition to another expression, which must be classed with the

      most remarkable theorems of this study. If the nature of the curved surface be

      expressed by this method, the general expression for any linear element upon
          pp
                22222
                      + dy+ dz, has the formE dp+ 2F dp   dq + G dq, where
it, or fordx

      E, F, G are again functions of p and q. The new expression for the measure of

        curvature mentioned above contains merely these magnitudes and their partial

      di erential coe cients of the  rst and second order. Therefore we notice that,

      in order to determine the measure of curvature, it is necessary to know only

      the general expression for a linear element; the expressions for the coordinates

      x, y, z are not required. A direct result from this is the remarkable theorem:

      If a curved surface, or a part of it, can be developed upon another surface, the

        measure of curvature at every point remains unchanged after the development.

      In particular, it follows from this further: Upon a curved surface that can be

      developed upon a plane, the measure of curvature is everywhere equal to zero.

        From this we derive at once the characteristic equation of surfaces developable

  upon a plane, namely,

      when z is regarded as a function of x and y. This equation has been known for

      some time, but according to the author’s judgment it has not been established

  previously with the necessary rigor.

            These theorems lead to the consideration of the theory of curved surfaces from

      a new point of view, where a wide and still wholly uncultivated  eld is open to

        investigation. If we consider surfaces not as boundaries of bodies, but as bodies

      of which one dimension vanishes, and if at the same time we conceive them as

         exible but not extensible, we see that two essentially di erent relations must be

        distinguished, namely, on the one hand, those that presuppose a de nite form of

        the surface in space; on the other hand, those that are independent of the various

        forms which the surface may assume. This discussion is concerned with the latter.

        In accordance with what has been said, the measure of curvature belongs to this

      case. But it is easily seen that the consideration of  gures constructed upon

      the surface, their angles, their areas and their integral curvatures, the joining

      of the points by means of shortest lines, and the like, also belong to this case.

      All such investigations must start from this, that the very nature of the curved

      surface is given by means of the expression of any linear element in the form
p
      22
          E dp+ 2F dp   dq + G dq. The author has embodied in the present treatise a

        portion of his investigations in this  eld, made several years ago, while he limits

      himself to such as are not too remote for an introduction, and may, to some

        extent, be generally helpful in many further investigations. In our abstract, we

      must limit ourselves still more, and be content with citing only a few of them as

      types. The following theorems may serve for this purpose.          46gauss’s abstract.


                If upon a curved surface a system of in nitely many shortest lines of equal

            lengths be drawn from one initial point, then will the line going through the end

                  points of these shortest lines cut each of them at right angles. If at every point

                  of an arbitrary line on a curved surface shortest lines of equal lengths be drawn

              at right angles to this line, then will all these shortest lines be perpendicular also

            to the line which joins their other end points. Both these theorems, of which the

                  latter can be regarded as a generalization of the former, will be demonstrated

            both analytically and by simple geometrical considerations. The excess of the

                  sum of the angles of a triangle formed by shortest lines over two right angles is

            equal to the total curvature of the triangle.

                    It will be assumed here that that angle (571745) to which an arc equal to

                  the radius of the sphere corresponds will be taken as the unit for the angles, and

                  that for the unit of total curvature will be taken a part of the spherical surface,

                the area of which is a square whose side is equal to the radius of the sphere.

              Evidently we can express this important theorem thus also: the excess over two

                  right angles of the angles of a triangle formed by shortest lines is to eight right

                  angles as the part of the surface of the auxiliary sphere, which corresponds to it

                  as its integral curvature, is to the whole surface of the sphere. In general, the

                excess over 2n 4 right angles of the angles of a polygon of n sides, if these are

              shortest lines, will be equal to the integral curvature of the polygon.

                  The general investigations developed in this treatise will, in the conclusion,

              be applied to the theory of triangles of shortest lines, of which we shall introduce

                only a couple of important theorems. If a, b, c be the sides of such a triangle

                (they will be regarded as magnitudes of the  rst order); A, B, C the angles

                  opposite;  , ,  the measures of curvature at the angular points;   the area of
                                                              1
                                                                     + +)  is the excess
            the triangle, then, to magnitudes of the fourth order,(
                                                              3
                  of the sum A + B + C over two right angles. Further, with the same degree of

                  exactness, the angles of a plane rectilinear triangle whose sides are a, b, c, are

        respectively

                  We see immediately that this last theorem is a generalization of the familiar

                  theorem  rst established by Legendre. By means of this theorem we obtain

                  the angles of a plane triangle, correct to magnitudes of the fourth order, if we

              diminish each angle of the corresponding spherical triangle by one-third of the

                  spherical excess. In the case of non-spherical surfaces, we must apply unequal

              reductions to the angles, and this inequality, generally speaking, is a magnitude

                  of the third order. However, even if the whole surface di ers only a little from

                  the spherical form, it will still involve also a factor denoting the degree of the

              deviation from the spherical form. It is unquestionably important for the higher

                  geodesy that we be able to calculate the inequalities of those reductions and

              thereby obtain the thorough conviction that, for all measurable triangles on the                                gauss’s abstract.47


      surface of the earth, they are to be regarded as quite insensible. So it is, for

      example, in the case of the greatest triangle of the triangulation carried out
                                                                                 
      by the author. The greatest side of this triangle is almost  fteen geographical

        miles, and the excess of the sum of its three angles over two right angles amounts

        almost to  fteen seconds. The three reductions of the angles of the plane triangle
    000000
      are 4:95113, 4:95104, 4:95131. Besides, the author also developed the missing

      terms of the fourth order in the above expressions. Those for the sphere possess

      a very simple form. However, in the case of measurable triangles upon the

      earth’s surface, they are quite insensible. And in the example here introduced

      they would have diminished the  rst reduction by only two units in the  fth

      decimal place and increased the third by the same amount.

        the study of curvature and of geodetic lines. The geometrical signi cance of the

      variables p, q is discussed more fully in Art. 17. This method of representation

        forms the source of many new theorems, of which these are particularly worthy

        of mention: the corollary, that the measure of curvature remains unchanged by

        the bending of the surface (Arts. 11, 12); the theorems of Arts. 15, 16 concerning

      geodetic lines; the theorem of Art. 20; and,  nally, the results derived in the

        conclusion, which refer a geodetic triangle to the rectilinear triangle whose sides

  are of the same length.” [Wangerin.]

      found in Art. 4 for X, Y , Z belong to the normal directed outwards, which to

      the normal directed inwards, we need only to apply the theorem of Art. 2 (VII),

      provided we use the second method of representing the surface. If, on the

        contrary, the surface is de ned by the equation between the coordinates W = 0,

        then the following simpler considerations lead to the answer. We draw the line d 

      from the point A towards the outer side, then, if dx, dy, dz are the projections

of d , we have

                              P dx + Q dy + R dz > 0:

        This condition, since d  is positive, must be combined with the preceding, if the

       rst solution is taken for X, Y , Z. This result is obtained in a similar way, if

          the surface is analytically de ned by the third method.” [Wangerin.]

      at that point, or double the so-called mean curvature. Cf. Crelle’s Journ. für

      the squares of the reciprocals of the principal radii of curvature at a point of the

      form of a triangle can be used in the calculation of the measure of curvature,

      follows from this fact that, according to the formula developed on page 11, k is

        independent of the magnitudes dx, dy,  x,  y, and that, consequently, k has the

      same value for every in nitely small triangle at the same point of the surface,

      therefore also for surface elements of any form whatever lying at that point.”

                    By writing for B,  , , a in [8], A, ,  , b respectively, we obtain at once

                formula [9]. Likewise by writing for B, , , c in [8], C, , , b respectively, we

                  obtain formula [10]. Formulæ [9] and [10] can, of course, also be derived by the

          method used to derive [8].

            sign. All the editions prior to Wangerin’s have the incorrect sign.

        Art. 26, p. 40. Derivation of formula [14].

          This formula is derived at once by adding formulæ [11], [12], [13]. But, as

      Gauss suggests, it may also be derived from [6], page 36. By priming the q’s
                              00
  in [6] we obtain a series for ( + ). Subtracting this series from [6], and noting
          00
that    +   +    = A + B + C, we have, correct to terms of the  fth

      Substituting this value for sinA in [9], page 38, we have, correct to terms of
                                                                               
    the sixth degree, the  rst formula for   given in Art. 29. Since 2bccosA, or

    b+ c a, di ers from 2bccosA only by terms above the second degree, we
                                                                        1

      Hence, if we make these substitutions in the  rst formula for  , we obtain the

      second formula for   with the same exactness. In the case of a sphere, where

          Although the real purpose of this work is the deduction of new theorems

        concerning its subject, nevertheless we shall  rst develop what is already known,

      partly for the sake of consistency and completeness, and partly because our

        method of treatment is di erent from that which has been used heretofore. We

        shall even begin by advancing certain properties concerning plane curves from

  the same principles.


                                        1.

            In order to compare in a convenient manner the di erent directions of straight

      lines in a plane with each other, we imagine a circle with unit radius described

      in the plane about an arbitrary centre. The position of the radius of this circle,

      drawn parallel to a straight line given in advance, represents then the position

    of that line. And the angle which two straight lines make with each other

      is measured by the angle between the two radii representing them, or by the

      arc included between their extremities. Of course, where precise de nition is

      necessary, it is speci ed at the outset, for every straight line, in what sense it is

      regarded as drawn. Without such a distinction the direction of a straight line

    would always correspond to two opposite radii.


                                        2.

            In the auxiliary circle we take an arbitrary radius as the  rst, or its terminal

      point in the circumference as the origin, and determine the positive sense of

      measuring the arcs from this point (whether from left to right or the contrary);

      in the opposite direction the arcs are regarded then as negative. Thus every

      direction of a straight line is expressed in degrees, etc., or also by a number

  which expresses them in parts of the radius.
                                                
        Such lines as di er in direction by 360, or by a multiple of 360, have,

        therefore, precisely the same direction, and may, generally speaking, be regarded

      as the same. However, in such cases where the manner of describing a variable

      angle is taken into consideration, it may be necessary to distinguish carefully
                       
angles di ering by 360.

            If, for example, we have decided to measure the arcs from left to right, and if
                        000
    to two straight lines l, lcorrespond the two directions L, L, then L L is the
                                                                            0
      angle between those two straight lines. And it is easily seen that, since L L          80karl friedrich gauss


                            
                  falls between 180and +180, the positive or negative value indicates at once
            0
                that llies on the right or the left of l, as seen from the point of intersection.
                                                                0
              This will be determined generally by the sign of sin(L L).

                                  0
          called the amplitude of aa.
                                                            0
                The comparison of the amplitude of the arc aawith its length gives us the
                                                              0
                notion of curvature. Let l be any point on the arc aa, and let  ,   be the same
                                              000
                with reference to it that  , A and  , Aare with reference to a and a. If now

                 or   A be proportional to the part al of the arc, then we shall say that
          0
              aais uniformly curved throughout its whole length, and we shall call

                                                A

                                                al

                the measure of curvature, or simply the curvature. We easily see that this
                              0
                  happens only when aais actually the arc of a circle, and that then, according

                                                        if r denotes the radius. Since we
          to our de nition, its curvature will be  
                                                    r
                  always regard r as positive, the upper or the lower sign will hold according as
                                                              0
                the centre lies to the right or to the left of the arc aa(a being regarded as the
                      0
                  initial point, aas the end point, and the directions on the auxiliary circle being

              measured from left to right). Changing one of these conditions changes the sign,

            changing two restores it again.

                  On the contrary, if   A be not proportional to al, then we call the arc

          non-uniformly curved and the quotient

                                                A

                                                al

                  may then be called its mean curvature. Curvature, on the contrary, always

              presupposes that the point is determined, and is de ned as the mean curvature

            of an element at this point; it is therefore equal to

                                              d 
                                                  :
                                              d al

              We see, therefore, that arc, amplitude, and curvature sustain a similar relation

                  to each other as time, motion, and velocity, or as volume, mass, and density.

            The reciprocal of the curvature, namely,

                  is called the radius of curvature at the point l. And, in keeping with the above

              conventions, the curve at this point is called concave toward the right and convex

              toward the left, if the value of the curvature or of the radius of curvature happens

              to be positive; but, if it happens to be negative, the contrary is true.              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]81

          If we refer the position of a point in the plane to two perpendicular axes
                                                             
      of coordinates to which correspond the directions 0 and 90, in such a manner

      that the  rst coordinate represents the distance of the point from the second

      axis, measured in the direction of the  rst axis; whereas the second coordinate

      represents the distance from the  rst axis, measured in the direction of the

      second axis; if, further, the indeterminates x, y represent the coordinates of a

      point on the curved line, s the length of the line measured from an arbitrary

      origin to this point,   the direction of the tangent at this point, and r the radius

  of curvature; then we shall have

                                  dx = cos    ds;

                                  dy = sin    ds;

  a function of x, y, and if we set

                                  dV = p dx + q dy;

  then on the curved line

                                  p dx + q dy = 0:

Hence

                                pcos  + q sin  = 0;

and therefore

We have also

                  cos    dp + sin    dq (psin  q cos )d  = 0:

    If, therefore, we set, according to a well known theorem,

                                  dp = P dx + Q dy;

                                  dq = Q dx + R dy;

then we have

                    The ambiguous sign in the last formula might at  rst seem out of place,

                but upon closer consideration it is found to be quite in order. In fact, since

              this expression depends simply upon the partial di erentials of V , and since the

                function V itself merely de nes the nature of the curve without at the same

                time  xing the sense in which it is supposed to be described, the question,

              whether the curve is convex toward the right or left, must remain undetermined

                  until the sense is determined by some other means. The case is similar in the

              determination of   by means of the tangent, to single values of which correspond
                                     
                  two angles di ering by 180. The sense in which the curve is described can be

          speci ed in the following di erent ways.


                    I. By means of the sign of the change in x. If x increases, then cos  must

                be positive. Hence the upper signs will hold if q has a negative value, and the

                lower signs if q has a positive value. When x decreases, the contrary is true.


                    II. By means of the sign of the change in y. If y increases, the upper signs

                  must be taken when p is positive, the lower when p is negative. The contrary is

        true when y decreases.


                  III. By means of the sign of the value which the function V takes for

                points not on the curve. Let  x,  y be the variations of x, y when we go out

                  from the curve toward the right, at right angles to the tangent, that is, in the
                         
                  direction   + 90; and let the length of this normal be   . Then, evidently, we

        have

                                                           
                                         x =      cos(  + 90);
                                                         
                                         y =      sin(  + 90);

        or

                                           x =      sin ;

                                           y = +     cos :

            Since now, when    is in nitely small,

                                     V = p  x + q  y

                                        = (psin  + q cos )  
                                            p
                                                22
                                                p+ q;
                                      =    

              and since on the curve itself V vanishes, the upper signs will hold if V , on

              passing through the curve from left to right, changes from positive to negative,

                and the contrary. If we combine this with what is said at the end of Art. 2, it              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]83


        follows that the curve is always convex toward that side on which V receives the

same sign as
                                  22
                                P q 2Qpq + Rp:

        For example, if the curve is a circle, and if we set

                                      222
                                V = x+ y a;

then we have

                                p = 2x; q = 2y;

                            P = 2; Q = 0; R = 2;
                        22222
                        P q 2Qpq + Rp= 8y+ 8x= 8a;

                                  223=23
                                (p+ q)= 8a;

                                      r =  a;

    and the curve will be convex toward that side for which

                                    222
                                  x+ y> a;

as it should be.

          The side toward which the curve is convex, or, what is the same thing, the

      signs in the above formulæ, will remain unchanged by moving along the curve,

so long as
                                         V

                                          

        does not change its sign. Since V is a continuous function, such a change can take

      place only when this ratio passes through the value zero. But this necessarily

      presupposes that p and q become zero at the same time. At such a point the

        radius of curvature becomes in nite or the curvature vanishes. Then, generally

  speaking, since here

                                    psin  + q cos 

      will change its sign, we have here a point of in exion.


                                        5.

          The case where the nature of the curve is expressed by setting y equal to a

    given function of x, namely, y = X, is included in the foregoing, if we set

                                    V = X y:

If we put
                                  0000
                            dX = Xdx; dX= Xdx;

then we have

                                    0
                              p = X
                                      ; q = 1;
                                00
                          P = X; Q = 0; R = 0;          84karl friedrich gauss


        therefore
                                                    00
                                                  X
                                        1
                                          =
                                       :
                                                    023=2
                                          r(1 + X)

                Since q is negative here, the upper sign holds for increasing values of x. We
                                                        00
                  can therefore say, brie y, that for a positive Xthe curve is concave toward the

                  same side toward which the y-axis lies with reference to the x-axis; while for a
                  00
            negative Xthe curve is convex toward this side.


                                                6.

                If we regard x, y as functions of s, these formulæ become still more elegant.

        Let us set

                                                    0
                                                  dx
                                      dx
                                            000
                                          = x;= x;
                                      dsds
                                                    0

                                            000
                                          = y;= y:
                                      dsds

          Then we shall have

                                    00
                                    x= cos ; y= sin ;

                                           sin cos 
                                    0000

                                            rr

        or

                                    000000
                                    y= rx; x= ry;

        or also
                                              000000
                                        1 = r(xy yx);

        so that
                                            000000
                                            xy yx

          represents the curvature, and
                                                1
                                            000000
                                            xy yx

        the radius of curvature.


                                                7.

                    We shall now proceed to the consideration of curved surfaces. In order

                to represent the directions of straight lines in space considered in its three

                  dimensions, we imagine a sphere of unit radius described about an arbitrary

                  centre. Accordingly, a point on this sphere will represent the direction of all

                straight lines parallel to the radius whose extremity is at this point. As the

                  positions of all points in space are determined by the perpendicular distances              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]85


      x, y, z from three mutually perpendicular planes, the directions of the three

        principal axes, which are normal to these principal planes, shall be represented on

        the auxiliary sphere by the three points (1), (2), (3). These points are, therefore,
           
      always 90apart, and at once indicate the sense in which the coordinates are

        supposed to increase. We shall here state several well known theorems, of which

  constant use will be made.


          1) The angle between two intersecting straight lines is measured by the

      arc [of the great circle] between the points on the sphere which represent their

directions.


            2) The orientation of every plane can be represented on the sphere by means

      of the great circle in which the sphere is cut by the plane through the centre

  parallel to the  rst plane.


          3) The angle between two planes is equal to the angle between the great

        circles which represent their orientations, and is therefore also measured by the

  angle between the poles of the great circles.

                    000
            4) If x, y, z; x, y, zare the coordinates of two points, r the distance

      between them, and L the point on the sphere which represents the direction of

      the straight line drawn from the  rst point to the second, then

                                0
                                x= x + rcos(1)L;
                                0
                                  y= y + rcos(2)L;
                                0
                                2= z + rcos(3)L:


        5) It follows immediately from this that we always have

                          222
                          cos(1)L + cos(2)L + cos(3)L = 1

              0
    [and] also, if Lis any other point on the sphere,

                      0000
              cos(1)L   cos(1)L+ cos(2)L   cos(2)L+ cos(3)L   cos(3)L= cosLL:

            We shall add here another theorem, which has appeared nowhere else, as far

    as we know, and which can often be used with advantage.
            000000000
        Let L, L, L, Lbe four points on the sphere, and A the angle which LL
      000
      and LLmake at their point of intersection. [Then we have]

              000000000000000000
          cosLL  cosLL cosLL  cosLL= sinLL  sinLL  cosA:

        The proof is easily obtained in the following way. Let

                              000000000000
              AL = t; AL
                                  = t; AL= t; AL= t;          86karl friedrich gauss


        we have then

                                  000
                              cosLL= cost cost+ sint sintcosA;
                                000000000000000
                              cosLL= costcost+ sintsintcosA;
                                  000000
                              cosLL= cost cost+ sint sintcosA;
                                000000000000
                              cosLL= costcost+ sintsintcosA:

        Therefore

                00000000000
            cosLLcosLL cosLLcosLL
                                                000000000000
                                  = cosAfcostcostsintsint+ costcostsintsint
                                                  000000000000

                                                000000000000
                                  = cosA(costsint costsint)(costsint costsint)
                                          000000
                              = cosAsin(t t) sin(t t)
                                            000000
                              = cosAsinLLsinLL:

                  Since each of the two great circles goes out from A in two opposite directions,

                two supplementary angles are formed at this point. But it is seen from our

            analysis that those branches must be chosen, which go in the same sense from L
                000000
            toward Land from Ltoward L.

                Instead of the angle A, we can take also the distance of the pole of the great
                000000
                circle LLfrom the pole of the great circle LL. However, since every great

              circle has two poles, we see that we must join those about which the great circles
                                                000000
                run in the same sense from L toward Land from Ltoward L, respectively.

                  The development of the special case, where one or both of the arcs
          000000 
          LLand LLare 90, we leave to the reader.


                    6) Another useful theorem is obtained from the following analysis. Let
            000
            L, L, Lbe three points upon the sphere and put

                          cosL (1) = x;cosL (2) = y;cosL (3) = z;
                            000000
                          cosL(1) = x; cosL(2) = y; cosL(3) = z;
                            000000000000
                          cosL(1) = x; cosL(2) = y; cosL(3) = z:


                  We assume that the points are so arranged that they run around the triangle

                  included by them in the same sense as the points (1), (2), (3). Further, let   be
                                        000
              that pole of the great circle LLwhich lies on the same side as L. We then

          have, from the above lemma,

      Therefore, if we multiply these equations by x, y, z respectively, and add the

  products, we obtain

      we easily see that this value is one-sixth of the pyramid whose angular points

          The nature of a curved surface is de ned by an equation between the coor-

  dinates of its points, which we represent by

                                              y
                                  f(x; y; z) = 0:

    Let the total di erential of f(x; y; z) be

                                P dx + Q dy + R dz;

      where P, Q, R are functions of x, y, z. We shall always distinguish two sides

      of the surface, one of which we shall call the upper, and the other the lower.

      Generally speaking, on passing through the surface the value of f changes its

      sign, so that, as long as the continuity is not interrupted, the values are positive

  on one side and negative on the other.

            The direction of the normal to the surface toward that side which we regard

      as the upper side is represented upon the auxiliary sphere by the point L. Let

                  cosL(1) = X;cosL(2) = Y;cosL(3) = Z:

      Also let ds denote an in nitely small line upon the surface; and, as its direction

      is denoted by the point   on the sphere, let

                  cos (1) =  ;cos (2) =  ;cos (3) =  :

We then have

                      dx =   ds; dy =   ds; dz =   ds;

therefore

                                P   + Q  + R  = 0;          88karl friedrich gauss


                                           
          and, since  L must be equal to 90, we have also

                                        X  + Y   + Z  = 0:

                Since P, Q, R, X, Y , Z depend only on the position of the surface on which

                  we take the element, and since these equations hold for every direction of the

                element on the surface, it is easily seen that P, Q, R must be proportional to

          X, Y , Z. Therefore

                                P = X ; Q = Y  ; R = Z :

        Therefore, since

                                          222
                                        X+ Y+ Z= 1;

                                          = P X + QY + RZ


        and

                                        2222
                                         = P+ Q+ R;


        or

                                            p
                                                222
                                        =  
                                              P+ Q+ R:

                  If we go out from the surface, in the direction of the normal, a distance equal

          to the element   , then we shall have

                                 x = X   ;  y = Y   ;  z = Z   

        and

                                   f = P  x + Q  y + R  z =     :

                  We see, therefore, how the sign of   depends on the change of sign of the value

          of f in passing from the lower to the upper side.


                                                9.

                    Let us cut the curved surface by a plane through the point to which our

                notation refers; then we obtain a plane curve of which ds is an element, in

                  connection with which we shall retain the above notation. We shall regard as

                  the upper side of the plane that one on which the normal to the curved surface

                lies. Upon this plane we erect a normal whose direction is expressed by the

                  point L of the auxiliary sphere. By moving along the curved line,   and L will

            therefore change their positions, while L remains constant, and  L and  L are
                           
                  always equal to 90. Therefore   describes the great circle one of whose poles
                                                              ds
                                                                           denotes the radius
            is L. The element of this great circle will be equal to, if r
                                                                r
                  of curvature of the curve. And again, if we denote the direction of this element              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]89


                      00
      upon the sphere by  , then  will evidently lie in the same great circle and be
   
    90from   as well as from L. If we now set

                    000000
                  cos (1) =  ;cos (2) =  ;cos (3) =  ;

  then we shall have

                                            dsds
                          ds

                    d  =  
                            rrr

      since, in fact,  ,  ,   are merely the coordinates of the point   referred to the

  centre of the sphere.

          Since by the solution of the equation f(x; y; z) = 0 the coordinate z may

      be expressed in the form of a function of x, y, we shall, for greater simplicity,

    assume that this has been done and that we have found

                                  z = F(x; y):

    We can then write as the equation of the surface

                                  z F(x; y) = 0;

or

                              f(x; y; z) = z F(x; y):

      From this follows, if we set

                              dF(x; y) = t dx + u dy;

                          P = t; Q = u; R = 1;

      where t, u are merely functions of x and y. We set also

                        dt = T dx + U dy; du = U dx + V dy:

      Therefore upon the whole surface we have

                                  dz = t dx + u dy

  and therefore, on the curve,

                                      = t  + u :

      Hence di erentiation gives, on substituting the above values for d , d , d ,

                Before we further transform the expression just found, we will make a few

        remarks about it.

                    A normal to a curve in its plane corresponds to two directions upon the

                sphere, according as we draw it on the one or the other side of the curve. The
                                                                              0
                  one direction, toward which the curve is concave, is denoted by  , the other

                by the opposite point on the sphere. Both these points, like L and L, are
            
                90from  , and therefore lie in a great circle. And since L is also 90from  ,
                 00 
            LL = 90 L , or = L  90. Therefore

                                            0
                                        cosL =  sinLL;

                where sinLL is necessarily positive. Since r is regarded as positive in our
                                  0
              analysis, the sign of cosL will be the same as that of

                                        22
                                      Z( T + 2  U +  V ):

                                                                                  0
                And therefore a positive value of this last expression means that L is less
                 
              than 90, or that the curve is concave toward the side on which lies the

            projection of the normal to the surface upon the plane. A negative value, on the

              contrary, shows that the curve is convex toward this side. Therefore, in general,

        we may set also
                                            22
                                          Z( T + 2  U +  V )
                                  1
                                    =;
                                  rsinLL

                  if we regard the radius of curvature as positive in the  rst case, and negative in

                  the second. LL is here the angle which our cutting plane makes with the plane

                  tangent to the curved surface, and we see that in the di erent cutting planes

            passed through the same point and the same tangent the radii of curvature are

                  proportional to the sine of the inclination. Because of this simple relation, we

                  shall limit ourselves hereafter to the case where this angle is a right angle, and

                  where the cutting plane, therefore, is passed through the normal of the curved

              surface. Hence we have for the radius of curvature the simple formula

                                  1
                                            22
                                      = Z( T + 2  U +  V ):
                                  r

                                              11.

                    Since an in nite number of planes may be passed through this normal,

                it follows that there may be in nitely many di erent values of the radius of

                curvature. In this case T, U, V , Z are regarded as constant,  ,  ,   as variable.

                In order to make the latter depend upon a single variable, we take two  xed
                    0 
                  points M, M90apart on the great circle whose pole is L. Let their coordinates
                                                          000
            referred to the centre of the sphere be  , , ;  , , . We have then

                                                    00
                  cos (1) = cos M   cosM(1) + cos M  cosM(1) + cos L   cosL(1):              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]91


If we set

                                     M =  ;

then we have
                                        0
                                  cos M= sin ;

  and the formula becomes

                                              0
                                  =  cos  +  sin ;

                  Just as to each point on the curved surface corresponds a particular point L

                  on the auxiliary sphere, by means of the normal erected at this point and the

                  radius of the auxiliary sphere parallel to the normal, so the aggregate of the

                  points on the auxiliary sphere, which correspond to all the points of a line on

                  the curved surface, forms a line which will correspond to the line on the curved

              surface. And, likewise, to every  nite  gure on the curved surface will correspond

                  a  nite  gure on the auxiliary sphere, the area of which upon the latter shall be

                  regarded as the measure of the amplitude of the former. We shall either regard

                this area as a number, in which case the square of the radius of the auxiliary

                sphere is the unit, or else express it in degrees, etc., setting the area of the
                                 
          hemisphere equal to 360.

                  The comparison of the area upon the curved surface with the corresponding

                amplitude leads to the idea of what we call the measure of curvature of the

                surface. If the former is proportional to the latter, the curvature is called

                uniform; and the quotient, when we divide the amplitude by the surface, is

                  called the measure of curvature. This is the case when the curved surface is a

              sphere, and the measure of curvature is then a fraction whose numerator is unity

              and whose denominator is the square of the radius.

                We shall regard the measure of curvature as positive, if the boundaries of

                  the  gures upon the curved surface and upon the auxiliary sphere run in the

              same sense; as negative, if the boundaries enclose the  gures in contrary senses.              new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]93


      If they are not proportional, the surface is non-uniformly curved. And at each

      point there exists a particular measure of curvature, which is obtained from

        the comparison of corresponding in nitesimal parts upon the curved surface and

      the auxiliary sphere. Let d  be a surface element on the former, and d  the

    corresponding element upon the auxiliary sphere, then

                                        d 

                                        d 

    will be the measure of curvature at this point.

          In order to determine their boundaries, we  rst project both upon the xy-

      plane. The magnitudes of these projections are Z d , Z d . The sign of Z will

        show whether the boundaries run in the same sense or in contrary senses around

      the surfaces and their projections. We will suppose that the  gure is a triangle;

    the projection upon the xy-plane has the coordinates

                    x; y;x + dx; y + dy;x +  x; y +  y:

  Hence its double area will be

                              2Z d  = dx    y dy    x:

        To the projection of the corresponding element upon the sphere will correspond

  the coordinates:

                                                      Y;
                        X;

                    @x@y@x@y

    From this the double area of the element is found to be

                We will now investigate the nature of shortest lines upon curved surfaces.

                The nature of a curved line in space is determined, in general, in such a way

                  that the coordinates x, y, z of each point are regarded as functions of a single

                variable, which we shall call w. The length of the curve, measured from an

              arbitrary origin to this point, is then equal to

                                s

                  If we allow the curve to change its position by an in nitely small variation, the

        The expression under the integral sign must vanish in the case of a minimum, as

      we know. Since the curved line lies upon a given curved surface whose equation

is

                              P dx + Q dy + R dz = 0;

    the equation between the variations  x,  y,  z


                              P  z + Q  y + R  z = 0


        must also hold. From this, by means of well known principles, we easily conclude

that the di erentials

        must be proportional to the quantities P, Q, R respectively. If ds is an element of

        the curve;   the point upon the auxiliary sphere, which represents the direction

      of this element; L the point giving the direction of the normal as above; and

                Therefore we see that the above di erentials will be equal to d , d , d . And

                since P, Q, R are proportional to the quantities X, Y , Z, the character of the

        shortest line is such that

                To every point of a curved line upon a curved surface there correspond two

            points on the sphere, according to our point of view; namely, the point  , which

              represents the direction of the linear element, and the point L, which represents
                                                                               
                  the direction of the normal to the surface. The two are evidently 90apart. In

                  our former investigation (Art. 9), where [we] supposed the curved line to lie in

                  a plane, we had two other points upon the sphere; namely, L, which represents
                                                        0
                  the direction of the normal to the plane, and  , which represents the direction

                  of the normal to the element of the curve in the plane. In this case, therefore,
                                    0
                L was a  xed point and  ,  were always in a great circle whose pole was L. In
                                                                          0
              generalizing these considerations, we shall retain the notation L,  , but we must

                  de ne the meaning of these symbols from a more general point of view. When

                the curve s is described, the points L,   also describe curved lines upon the

              auxiliary sphere, which, generally speaking, are no longer great circles. Parallel

                to the element of the second line, we draw a radius of the auxiliary sphere to
                    00
                the point  , but instead of this point we take the point opposite when  is
                     
                  more than 90from L. In the  rst case, we regard the element at   as positive,

                  and in the other as negative. Finally, let L be the point on the auxiliary sphere,
                   00
              which is 90from both   and  , and which is so taken that  ,  , L lie in the

          same order as (1), (2), (3).

                    The coordinates of the four points of the auxiliary sphere, referred to its

        centre, are for

                                        L X Y Z

                  Hence each of these 4 points describes a line upon the auxiliary sphere, whose
                                                0
            elements we shall express by dL, d , d , dL. We have, therefore,

                                                  0
                                            d  =  d ;

    quantities X, Y , Z. But, since at the same time

  and since, further,

                      0000
                         X +  Y +  Z = cos L

                                        0
    and since we always choose the point  so that

                                    0 
                                     L < 90;

  then for the shortest line

                                     L = 0;

  or  and L must coincide. Therefore

                                    d  = X ds;

                                      d  = Y ds;

                                    d  = Z ds;

      and we have here, instead of 4 curved lines upon the auxiliary sphere, only 3 to

      consider. Every element of the second line is therefore to be regarded as lying

    in the great circle L . And the positive or negative value of   refers to the

          concavity or the convexity of the curve in the direction of the normal.


                                        14.

            We shall now investigate the spherical angle upon the auxiliary sphere, which

      the great circle going from L toward   makes with that one going from L toward

      one of the  xed points (1), (2), (3); e. g., toward (3). In order to have something          98karl friedrich gauss


                  de nite here, we shall consider the sense from L(3) to L  the same as that in

              which (1), (2), and (3) lie. If we call this angle  , then it follows from the

          theorem of Art. 7 that

                                                                  y

            The form of the proof will require some modi cation and explanation, if the

      point (3) falls within the triangle. But, in general, we conclude

          The sum of the three angles of a triangle, which is formed of shortest lines
                                                                 
    upon an arbitrary curved surface, is equal to the sum of 180and the area of

      the triangle upon the auxiliary sphere, the boundary of which is formed by the

      points L, corresponding to the points in the boundary of the original triangle,

      and in such a manner that the area of the triangle may be regarded as positive

      or negative according as it is inclosed by its boundary in the same sense as the

  original  gure or the contrary.

            Wherefore we easily conclude also that the sum of all the angles of a polygon

      of n sides, which are shortest lines upon the curved surface, is [equal to] the sum
             
    of (n 2)180+ the area of the polygon upon the sphere etc.


                                        16.

            If one curved surface can be completely developed upon another surface, then

      all lines upon the  rst surface will evidently retain their magnitudes after the

      development upon the other surface; likewise the angles which are formed by

        the intersection of two lines. Evidently, therefore, such lines also as are shortest

      lines upon one surface remain shortest lines after the development. Whence,

      if to any arbitrary polygon formed of shortest lines, while it is upon the  rst

      surface, there corresponds the  gure of the zeniths upon the auxiliary sphere,

      the area of which is A, and if, on the other hand, there corresponds to the same

        polygon, after its development upon another surface, a  gure of the zeniths upon
                                            0
      the auxiliary sphere, the area of which is A, it follows at once that in every case

                                            0
                                      A = A:          102karl friedrich gauss


                  Although this proof originally presupposes the boundaries of the  gures to be

              shortest lines, still it is easily seen that it holds generally, whatever the boundary

              may be. For, in fact, if the theorem is independent of the number of sides, nothing

              will prevent us from imagining for every polygon, of which some or all of its sides

                  are not shortest lines, another of in nitely many sides all of which are shortest

        lines.

                Further, it is clear that every  gure retains also its area after the transfor-

          mation by development.

              We shall here consider 4  gures:


                1) an arbitrary  gure upon the  rst surface,


                2) the  gure on the auxiliary sphere, which corresponds to the zeniths of

        the previous  gure,


                  3) the  gure upon the second surface, which No. 1 forms by the development,


                  4) the  gure upon the auxiliary sphere, which corresponds to the zeniths of

        No. 3.

                Therefore, according to what we have proved, 2 and 4 have equal areas, as

              also 1 and 3. Since we assume these  gures in nitely small, the quotient obtained

                  by dividing 2 by 1 is the measure of curvature of the  rst curved surface at this

                  point, and likewise the quotient obtained by dividing 4 by 3, that of the second

              surface. From this follows the important theorem:

                  In the transformation of surfaces by development the measure of curvature at

          every point remains unchanged.

                This is true, therefore, of the product of the greatest and smallest radii of

        curvature.

                In the case of the plane, the measure of curvature is evidently everywhere

              zero. Whence follows therefore the important theorem:

                  For all surfaces developable upon a plane the measure of curvature everywhere

        vanishes,

          or

              which criterion is elsewhere derived from other principles, though, as it seems to

                  us, not with the desired rigor. It is clear that in all such surfaces the zeniths of

                all points can not  ll out any space, and therefore they must all lie in a line.

                    From a given point on a curved surface we shall let an in nite number of

              shortest lines go out, which shall be distinguished from one another by the angle                new general investigations of curved surfaces [1825]103


        which their  rst elements make with the  rst element of a de nite shortest line.

      This angle we shall call  . Further, let s be the length [measured from the given

      point] of a part of such a shortest line, and let its extremity have the coordinates

    x, y, z. Since   and s, therefore, belong to a perfectly de nite point on the

      curved surface, we can regard x, y, z as functions of   and s. The direction of

      the element of s corresponds to the point   on the sphere, whose coordinates

  are  ,  ,  . Thus we shall have

            The extremities of all shortest lines of equal lengths s correspond to a curved

      line whose length we may call t. We can evidently consider t as a function of

      s and  , and if the direction of the element of t corresponds upon the sphere to

            From this follows the beautiful theorem:

                    If all lines drawn from a point on the curved surface are shortest lines of

              equal lengths, they meet the line which joins their extremities everywhere at right

                  We can show in a similar manner that, if upon the curved surface any curved

                line whatever is given, and if we suppose drawn from every point of this line

                  toward the same side of it and at right angles to it only shortest lines of equal

                lengths, the extremities of which are joined by a line, this line will be cut at

                right angles by those lines in all its points. We need only let   in the above

                  development represent the length of the given curved line from an arbitrary

                  point, and then the above calculations retain their validity, except that u = 0

            for s = 0 is now contained in the hypothesis.

                    “The foregoing fragment, Neue allgemeine Untersuchungen über die krummen

              Flächen, di ers from the Disquisitiones not only in the more limited scope of the

              matter, but also in the method of treatment and the arrangement of the theorems.

                  There [paper of 1827] Gauss assumes that the rectangular coordinates x, y, z

                  of a point of the surface can be expressed as functions of any two independent

                variables p and q, while here [paper of 1825] he chooses as new variables the

                geodesic coordinates s and  . Here [paper of 1825] he begins by proving the

                theorem, that the sum of the three angles of a triangle, which is formed by
                                                                           
                  shortest lines upon an arbitrary curved surface, di ers from 180by the area of

            the triangle, which corresponds to it in the representation by means of parallel

              normals upon the auxiliary sphere of unit radius. From this, by means of simple

            geometrical considerations, he derives the fundamental theorem, that ‘in the

              transformation of surfaces by bending, the measure of curvature at every point

              remains unchanged.’ But there [paper of 1827] he  rst shows, in Art. 11, that the

            measure of curvature can be expressed simply by means of the three quantities

                E, F, G, and their derivatives with respect to p and q, from which follows

              the theorem concerning the invariant property of the measure of curvature as a

                  corollary; and only much later, in Art. 20, quite independently of this, does he

                prove the theorem concerning the sum of the angles of a geodesic triangle.”

                  therefore, the algebraic sign of the expression for the volume of this pyramid
                                    000
                  depends upon that of sinLL. Hence it is positive, zero, or negative according

            according to well known principles of spherical trigonometry,

                  measured from the arc LLto LL, and so for the other angles. At the same time

                  we easily see that this value is one-sixth of the pyramid whose angular points

          The sum of all the angles of a polygon of n sides, which are shortest lines
                                                             
    upon the curved surface, is equal to the sum of (n 2)180and the area of the

      polygon upon the auxiliary sphere whose boundary is formed by the points L

      which correspond to the points of the boundary of the given polygon, and in

        such a manner that the area of this polygon may be regarded positive or negative

      according as it is enclosed by its boundary in the same sense as the given  gure

or the contrary.

          Art. 16, p. 101. The zenith of a point on the surface is the corresponding

      point on the auxiliary sphere. It is the spherical representation of the point.

          Art. 18, p. 107. The normal to the surface is here taken in the direction

  opposite to that given by [9] page 104.BIBLIOGRAPHY                                  BIBLIOGRAPHY.

          This bibliography is limited to books, memoirs, etc., which use Gauss’s

      method and which treat, more or less generally, one or more of the following

      subjects: curvilinear coordinates, geodesic and isometric lines, curvature of

        surfaces, deformation of surfaces, orthogonal systems, and the general theory

        of surfaces. Several papers which lie beyond these limitations have been added

      because of their importance or historic interest. For want of space, generally,

        papers on minimal surfaces, congruences, and other subjects not mentioned above

have been excluded.

            Generally, the numbers following the volume number give the pages on which

  the paper is found.

      (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
        permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
      set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
        copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
      protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project
    Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
        charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you

      rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
      such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
        research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
        practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is

      THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
        PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

      To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
        distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
      (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
        Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
    Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
      http://gutenberg.net/license).


          Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
  electronic works

    1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
        electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
      and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
        (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
        the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
          all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
          If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
      Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
      terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
    entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.        IIlicense.



                  1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
            used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
                agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
              things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
                  even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
            paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
                Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
                and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
            works. See paragraph 1.E below.

                1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
              or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
              Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
                collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
              individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
              located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
                copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
              works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
                  are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
              Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
                freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
                this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
                  the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
                  keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
            Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

              1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
              what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
              a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
                  the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
                before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
                  creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
                Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning
                  the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
        States.

                  1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

                1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
                access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
              whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
              phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
                Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
          copied or distributed:

                This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
                  almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
            re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
            with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

                1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
              from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
              posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
              and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
                  or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
                with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
              work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
                  through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the                                    license.III


      Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

        1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
        with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
        must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
        terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
      to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
        permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

        1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
    work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

        1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
    electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
        prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
      active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
  Gutenberg-tm License.

      1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
          compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
        word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
        distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
      "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
          posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
      you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
      copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
      request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
        form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
        performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
    unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

      1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
          access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

      - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
            the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
          you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is
          owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
        has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
            Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments
        must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
          prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
          returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
            sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
            address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
            the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

          does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
        License. You must require such a user to return or
          destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

            forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

        1.F.

                1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
                effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
              public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
              collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
                works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
                  "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
                corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
              property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
                  computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
          your equipment.

              1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
              of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

              Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
                  Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
                  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
                  fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
                  LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
                  PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
              TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
                LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
              INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGE.

                  1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
              defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
                receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
            written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
              received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
              your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
              the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
              refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
                  providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
              receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
              is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
          opportunities to fix the problem.

              1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
              in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER                                      license.V


        WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

      1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
        warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
        If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
        law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
        interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
        the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
        provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

        1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
      trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
          providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
          with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
        promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
        harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
        that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
        or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
        work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
        Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


      Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

      Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
      including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
      because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
  people in all walks of life.

      Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
      goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
        remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
        and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

                  Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
            Literary Archive Foundation

            Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
                spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
              freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
                array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
              ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
          status with the IRS.

                  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
                  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
                States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
              considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
                  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
                  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
                SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
              particular state visit http://pglaf.org

              While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
                against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
          approach us with offers to donate.

              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
              any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
                  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

                  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
                  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
                  ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
                  donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


                Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
        works.

                Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
            concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
            with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
              Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


              Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
                  editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
                  unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
                keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.                                    license.VII
