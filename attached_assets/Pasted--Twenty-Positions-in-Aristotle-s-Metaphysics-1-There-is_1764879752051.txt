**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Metaphysics***

1. There is a science that studies **being qua being**—not any particular kind of being, but what it is to be at all, and the attributes that belong to being as such.

2. This science also studies **first principles and highest causes**—it is first philosophy, architectonic over all particular sciences.

3. **Substance (ousia) is the primary sense of being**—all other categories (quality, quantity, relation, etc.) depend on substance for their existence.

4. The question "what is being?" reduces to the question **"what is substance?"**—this is the central inquiry of metaphysics.

5. **Substance is that which is neither said of nor present in a subject**—it is the ultimate subject of predication that underlies all else.

6. Candidates for substance include **matter, form, and the composite**—Aristotle argues that form has the best claim to being substance in the primary sense.

7. **Form is the "what it was to be" (to ti ēn einai)**—the essence that makes a thing what it is and answers the question "what is it?"

8. **Matter is pure potentiality**—it is unknowable in itself and becomes determinate only through form.

9. **Definition expresses essence**—proper definitions state the form, articulating genus and differentia until the infima species is reached.

10. **Universals are not substances**—against Plato, Aristotle argues that no universal (animal, color) exists separately; only particulars are fully real.

11. **Platonic Forms are unnecessary and explanatorily impotent**—positing a separate Form of Man does not explain how particular men exist or come to be.

12. **Actuality (energeia) is prior to potentiality (dynamis)**—in definition, time, and substance; the actual is what the potential is for.

13. **The prime mover is pure actuality**—eternal, immaterial, unchanging, without potentiality; it is thought thinking itself.

14. The prime mover causes motion as **final cause**—it moves by being loved, as the object of desire and aspiration for the celestial spheres.

15. **There are multiple unmoved movers**—one for each celestial sphere, though the outermost sphere's mover is primary.

16. **Theology is first philosophy**—the study of the divine, immaterial, and eternal is the highest and most honorable science.

17. The **principle of non-contradiction** is the firmest of all principles—the same attribute cannot both belong and not belong to the same subject in the same respect.

18. The principle of non-contradiction **cannot be demonstrated** (that would be circular) but can be defended elenctically—anyone who denies it, in speaking meaningfully, presupposes it.

19. **Unity and being are convertible**—whatever is, is one; the senses of unity correspond to the senses of being.

20. Metaphysics is **wisdom (sophia)** in the highest sense—knowledge of first causes and principles, pursued for its own sake, making us free rather than servile to practical needs.
