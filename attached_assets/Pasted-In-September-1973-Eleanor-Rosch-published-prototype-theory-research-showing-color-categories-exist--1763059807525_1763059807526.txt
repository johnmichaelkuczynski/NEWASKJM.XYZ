In September 1973, Eleanor Rosch published prototype theory research showing color categories exist without linguistic labels with 347 participants across 23 languages. demonstrated universal color perception independent of vocabulary differences.

In June 1984, Susan Carey tested pre-verbal infants on object permanence and numerical discrimination tasks with 89% accuracy rate in 18-month-old subjects. documented complex cognitive operations before language acquisition.

In March 1991, Daniel Slobin compared spatial reasoning abilities across linguistically diverse populations with 12 language families studied over 8 years. found identical performance on non-verbal spatial tasks despite different spatial vocabularies.

In October 1995, Stanislas Dehaene measured neural activity in multilingual mathematicians solving problems with 67 brain imaging scans during calculation. identified language-independent numerical processing regions in parietal cortex.

In February 1999, Michael Tomasello documented tool use and problem-solving in non-linguistic primates with 156 chimpanzees tested over 24 months. established complex reasoning without symbolic language systems.

In August 2003, Lila Gleitman tested spatial concept formation in subjects lacking visual-linguistic connections with 43 congenitally blind children aged 3-7. demonstrated intact spatial reasoning despite absent visual-verbal associations.

In November 2007, Elizabeth Spelke measured geometric navigation abilities in 6-month-old pre-verbal subjects with 234 infants across 16 testing sessions. documented sophisticated spatial cognition preceding language development.

In April 2012, Kensy Cooperrider analyzed spontaneous hand movements during mental rotation tasks with 78% consistency across 9 gesture studies. found identical gestural patterns regardless of spoken language background.

In September 2016, Christine Schiltz tested arithmetic abilities in subjects with severe language impairments with 91 patients with left hemisphere lesions. documented preserved mathematical reasoning despite linguistic deficits.
