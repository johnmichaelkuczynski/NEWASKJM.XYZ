 THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA




_ Nicolo Machiavelli, born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. From 1494 to
1512 held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic
missions to various European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512;
later exiled and returned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd
June 1527._




INTRODUCTION


Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the
second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,
and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were
members of the old Florentine nobility.

His life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly
enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of
Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an
Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de’ Medici, Il Magnifico.
The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year
Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career
Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted
until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his
office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they
were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s
literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few
weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his
fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.




YOUTH — Æt. 1-25—1469-94


Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the
Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of
this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been
described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by
the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving
Lorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have
been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the
fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a
gibe in _The Prince_, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed
prophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean
rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli
strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to
Lorenzo’s grandson that he dedicates _The Prince_.

Machiavelli, in his “History of Florence,” gives us a picture of the
young men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: “They were freer
than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other
kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,
and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with
wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly
was thought the wisest.” In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli
shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and
leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:
“I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,
especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than
which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to
me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your
share.” Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: “This will turn
out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,
you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters
and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I
have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success
and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help
you if you help yourself.”




OFFICE — Æt. 25-43—1494-1512


The second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service of the
free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the
expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After
serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed
Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and
Peace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of
Machiavelli’s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the
affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and
dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere
recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and
soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and
supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters
which illustrate _The Prince_.

His first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, “my lady of Forli”
of _The Prince_, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it
is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on
fortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is
urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.

In 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for
continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct
of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft
summarized in _The Prince_, and was consequently driven out. He, also,
it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support
to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge
that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the
faith of princes.

Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out
of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the
Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of _The
Prince_. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke
for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have
seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the
pattern of Cesare Borgia’s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed
by some critics as the “hero” of _The Prince_. Yet in _The Prince_ the
duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the
fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that
might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save
him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens;
and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims
that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen
fatality.

On the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to
watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia
cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano
delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most
reason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election,
says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to
forget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had
ruined Cesare.

It was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that
pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought
to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing
chiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius
that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and
women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man
that will win and hold them both.

It is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian
states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,
with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those
events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they
impinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with
Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch’s character has
already been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as
the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but
who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,
had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have
been ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men
of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but
Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the
secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man,
without force of character—ignoring the human agencies necessary to
carry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of
his wishes.

The remaining years of Machiavelli’s official career were filled with
events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the
three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the
object of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in
the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won
in eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during
these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out
between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had
dictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II
finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance
of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy
of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the
Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st
September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal
for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end
to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining
office.




LITERATURE AND DEATH — Æt. 43-58—1512-27


On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had
vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence,
was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he
was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,
imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,
Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at
San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In
a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a
very interesting description of his life at this period, which
elucidates his methods and his motives in writing _The Prince_. After
describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he
writes: “The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at
the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,
and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass
into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly
received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I
do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their
actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I
feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,
death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.
And because Dante says:

Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,
Unfruitful else,

I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have
composed a small work on ‘Principalities,’ where I pour myself out as
fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a
principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how
they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever
pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,
especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it
to his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will
be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had
with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.”

The “little book” suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form
in which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work
during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some
unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de’ Medici. Although
Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or
presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo
ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any
employment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli’s lifetime,
_The Prince_ was never published by him, and its text is still
disputable.

Machiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: “And as to this
little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that
during the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have
neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by
one who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my
loyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not
now learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as
I have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my
honesty.”

Before Machiavelli had got _The Prince_ off his hands he commenced his
“Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,” which should be read
concurrently with _The Prince_. These and several minor works occupied
him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look
after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the
Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her
citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new
constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on
one pretext or another it was not promulgated.

In 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to
settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly
remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he
was much sought after, and also for the production of his “Art of War.”
It was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance
of Cardinal de’ Medici to write the “History of Florence,” a task which
occupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have
determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer
observes that “an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will
endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play
with.”

When the “History of Florence” was finished, Machiavelli took it to
Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de’ Medici, who had in
the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is
somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written _The
Prince_ for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained
power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the “History of Florence”
to the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year
the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left
Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This
was followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular
party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more
banished.

Machiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his
return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the “Ten of
Liberty and Peace.” Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached
Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.




THE MAN AND HIS WORKS


No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence
has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her
most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have
found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the
germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle
to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,
it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which
this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that
the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more
reasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an “unholy
necromancer,” which so long haunted men’s vision, has begun to fade.

Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and
industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and
with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced
retirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he
depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the
successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only
moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political
employments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,
overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren
of results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery
that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct
of his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear
by the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of
compromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to
suspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when
he set him to write the “History of Florence,” rather than employ him
in the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and
there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.

Although the light of almost four centuries has been focused on _The
Prince_, its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they
are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as
they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli’s contemporaries; yet
they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of
Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical
incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which
Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and
conduct.

Leaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish
some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, _The
Prince_ is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men
are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the
days of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices
which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.
Men will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them
to be—and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;
prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then—to pass to
a higher plane—Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an
empire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the
arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to
fight.

It is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli’s that government
should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the
people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of
society; to this “high argument” _The Prince_ contributes but little.
Machiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments
otherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and
insight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests _The
Prince_ with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the
incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which
still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other
and their neighbours.

In translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an
exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent
paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression.
Machiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he
wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his
substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. _Quis eo fuit
unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?_
In _The Prince_, it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not
only for every word, but for the position of every word. To an
Englishman of Shakespeare’s time the translation of such a treatise was
in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius
of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to
the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example:
the word _intrattenere_, employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy
adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would
by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered “entertain,” and every
contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that
“Rome _entertained_ the Ætolians and the Achaeans without augmenting
their power.” But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and
ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that “_Rome
maintained friendly relations with the Ætolians_,” etc., using four
words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity
of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to
the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that
the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author’s meaning, may
overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.

DEDICATION


To the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De’ Medici

Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed
to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in
which they see him take most delight; whence one often sees horses,
arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments presented
to princes, worthy of their greatness.

Desiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with some
testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among my
possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so much as,
the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by long experience
in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of antiquity; which,
having reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence, I now
send, digested into a little volume, to your Magnificence.

And although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance,
nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it may be acceptable,
seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to
offer you the opportunity of understanding in the shortest time all
that I have learnt in so many years, and with so many troubles and
dangers; which work I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent
words, nor stuffed with rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic
allurements or adornments whatever, with which so many are accustomed
to embellish their works; for I have wished either that no honour
should be given it, or else that the truth of the matter and the
weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable.

Nor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man of low
and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the concerns of
princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes place themselves
below in the plain to contemplate the nature of the mountains and of
lofty places, and in order to contemplate the plains place themselves
upon high mountains, even so to understand the nature of the people it
needs to be a prince, and to understand that of princes it needs to be
of the people.

Take then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in which I
send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered by you, you
will learn my extreme desire that you should attain that greatness
which fortune and your other attributes promise. And if your
Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your
eyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a
great and continued malignity of fortune.




THE PRINCE




CHAPTER I.
HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE
ACQUIRED


All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been
and are either republics or principalities.

Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long
established; or they are new.

The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or
they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the
prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of
the King of Spain.

Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a
prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of
the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.




CHAPTER II.
CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES


I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another
place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to
principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,
and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.

I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary
states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than
new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of
his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise,
for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless
he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if
he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to
the usurper, he will regain it.

We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have
withstood the attacks of the Venetians in ’84, nor those of Pope Julius
in ’10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the
hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it
happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices
cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects
will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and
duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are
lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.




CHAPTER III.
CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES


But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be
not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken
collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from
an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for
men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and
this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein
they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have
gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common
necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have
submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships
which he must put upon his new acquisition.

In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in
seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends
who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the
way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,
feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed
forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill
of the natives.

For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied
Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it
only needed Lodovico’s own forces; because those who had opened the
gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future
benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is
very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,
they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with
little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the
delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in
the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time
it was enough for the Duke Lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the
borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to
bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be
defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above
mentioned.

 [1] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who
 married Beatrice d’Este. He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and
 died in 1510.

Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second
time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains
to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and
what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself
more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.

Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an
ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country
and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold
them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government;
and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of
the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in
other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will
live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony,
and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,
although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the
customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst
themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has
only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of
their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws
nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will
become entirely one body with the old principality.

But when states are acquired in a country differing in language,
customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great
energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real
helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside
there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has
made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other
measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled
there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the
spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy
them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are
great, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the
country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied
by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have
more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He
who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost
caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested
from him with the greatest difficulty.

The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,
which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do
this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A
prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense
he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority
only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them
to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and
scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being
uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not
to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have
been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not
costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as
has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one
has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,
because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious
ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man
ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.

But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much
more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,
so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are
exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting
of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and
all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their
own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such
guards are as useless as a colony is useful.

Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects
ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful
neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care
that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a
footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be
introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of
ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were
brought into Greece by the Ætolians; and in every other country where
they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And
the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner
enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the
hatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to
those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over
to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he
has acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold
of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,
and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of
them, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does
not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,
and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and
troubles.

The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these
measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]
the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the
greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.
Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and
Ætolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was
humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and
Ætolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor
did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends
without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make
them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because
the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,
who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for
which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it
is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the
medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;
for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic
fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but
difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either
detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but
difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the
evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise
man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not
having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that
every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the
Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to
avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war
is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of
others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in
Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided
both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which
is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the
benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and
prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring
with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.

 [2] See remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”

But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the
things mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as
the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held
possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he
has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain
a state composed of divers elements.

 [3] Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People,” born 1462,
 died 1515.

 [4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.

King Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who
desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I
will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a
foothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every
door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to
accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have
succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not
made some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,
regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;
the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of
Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of
Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans,
the Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then
could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,
which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made
the king master of two-thirds of Italy.

Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could
have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above
laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although
they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the
Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been
forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have
made himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no
sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to
occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was
weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had
thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by
adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater
authority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to
follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of
Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was
himself forced to come into Italy.

And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and
deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,
divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter
in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country
and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and
whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he
drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out
in turn.

The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always
do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but
when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is
folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with
her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she
ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with
the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she
got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had
not the excuse of that necessity.

Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,
he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he
brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did
not send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to
injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from
the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought
Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to
humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have
consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have
kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would
never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also
because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order
to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not
have had the courage.

And if any one should say: “King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander
and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,” I answer for the reasons given
above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war,
because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your
disadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king
had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in
exchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to
Rouen,[6] to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the
faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.

 [5] Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and
 married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to
 retain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.

 [6] The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d’Amboise, created a
 cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.

Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the
conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and
wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that
is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes
with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope
Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal
Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I
replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning
that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such
greatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the
Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin
may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which
never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming
powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about
either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him
who has been raised to power.




CHAPTER IV.
WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL
AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH


Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly
acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great
became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was
scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole
empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained
themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose
among themselves from their own ambitions.

I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to
be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of
servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his
favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity
by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons
have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and
hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a
prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration,
because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as
superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as
to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular
affection.

The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the
King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one
lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into
sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and
changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the
midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects,
and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king
take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both
of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state
of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The
causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that
the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can
he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the
lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his
ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with
great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when
they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them,
for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in
mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his
own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has
been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot
replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this
prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the
others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not
rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.

The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because
one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,
for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,
for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the
victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with
infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from
those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated
the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves
the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either
to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings
the opportunity.

Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of
Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and
therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him
in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which
victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander,
for the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would
have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults
raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.

But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted
like that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the
Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities
there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them
endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the
power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed
away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting
afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself
his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed
there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other
than the Romans were acknowledged.

When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with
which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which
others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;
this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the
conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.




CHAPTER V.
CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER
THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED


Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been
accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three
courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the
next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live
under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an
oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a
government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand
without his friendship and interest, and does its utmost to support
him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will
hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other
way.

There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held
Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy: nevertheless they
lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,
dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as
the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did
not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities
in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them
otherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city
accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be
destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of
liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither
time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do
or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges
unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they
immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been
held in bondage by the Florentines.

But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and
his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to
obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in
making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern
themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a
prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But
in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire
for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of
their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them
or to reside there.




CHAPTER VI.
CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE’S OWN ARMS AND
ABILITY


Let no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities
as I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of
state; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others,
and following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely
to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A
wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to
imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not
equal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the
clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far
distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow
attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their
strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of
so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.

I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a
new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,
accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired
the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station
presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of
these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.
Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the
strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no
other state, is compelled to reside there in person.

But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,
have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,
and such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not
discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet
he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy
to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have
acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their
particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be
found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.
And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed
anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material
to mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that
opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and
without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.

It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of
Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that
they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of
bondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and
that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should
become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary
that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of
the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.
Theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians
dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,
and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity
whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.

Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a
principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The
difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules
and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their
government and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there
is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or
more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the
introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for
enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and
lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This
coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on
their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily
believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.
Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the
opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others
defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along
with them.

It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter
thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves
or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate
their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In
the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass
anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they
are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have
conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the
reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it
is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that
persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when
they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by
force.

If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not
have enforced their constitutions for long—as happened in our time to
Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things
immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no
means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the
unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties
in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the
ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are
overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated,
they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards
powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.

To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some
resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like
kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.[1] This man rose from a private
station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to
fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him
for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their
prince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one
who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.
This man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old
alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on
such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had
endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.

CHAPTER VII.
CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF
OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE


Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private
citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they
have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they
have many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state
is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as
happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the
Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might
hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those
emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens
came to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the
fortune of him who has elevated them—two most inconstant and unstable
things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;
because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not
reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having
always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it
because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.

States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature
which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and
correspondencies[1] fixed in such a way that the first storm will not
overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become
princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be
prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,
and that those foundations, which others have laid _before_ they became
princes, they must lay _afterwards_.

 [1] “Le radici e corrispondenze,” their roots (i.e. foundations) and
 correspondencies or relations with other states—a common meaning of
 “correspondence” and “correspondency” in the sixteenth and seventeenth
 centuries.

Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or
fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and
these are Francesco Sforza[2] and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper
means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be
Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties
he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called
by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy
of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he
had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise
and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and
fortunes of others had bestowed on him.

 [2] Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married Bianca Maria
 Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan,
 on whose death he procured his own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli
 was the accredited agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia
 (1478-1507) during the transactions which led up to the assassinations
 of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and along with his letters to
 his chiefs in Florence he has left an account, written ten years
 before _The Prince_, of the proceedings of the duke in his
 “Descritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare
 Vitellozzo Vitelli,” etc., a translation of which is appended to the
 present work.

Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations
may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be
laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,
therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be
seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not
consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what
better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;
and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but
the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.

Alexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had
many immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see
his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the
Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke
of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini
were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he
saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been
assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope,
namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved
him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers,
so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was
easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other
reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not
only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving
the former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy
with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He
was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the
attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the
king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the
Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was
hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to
him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that
the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him,
that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might
themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the
same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and
attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And
as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the
Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from
that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the
arms and the luck of others.

For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in
Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,
making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to
their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that
in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned
entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the
Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came
to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length
that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them,
called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the
rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless
dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the
French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by
trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse
to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the
mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with
all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the
Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his
power at Sinigalia.[3] Having exterminated the leaders, and turned
their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good
foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of
Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he
gained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice,
and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.

 [3] Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.

When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak
masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave
them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was
full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing
to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it
necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer
Ramiro d’Orco,[4] a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest
power. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the
greatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not
advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but
that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the
country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their
advocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some
hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the
people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if
any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in
the natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took
Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the
piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The
barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied
and dismayed.

 [4] Ramiro d’Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.

But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding
himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate
dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great
measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if
he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France,
for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would
not support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and
to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards
the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.
It was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would
have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.

Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future
he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church
might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which
Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by
exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as
to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to
himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope
with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the
college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before
the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first
shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had
accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords
as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the
Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And
as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany,
for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his
protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French
were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and
in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down
upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through
hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines
would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was
prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much
power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer
have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his
own power and ability.

But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He
left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the
rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick
unto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and
he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the
foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not
had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he
would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his
foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a
month. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst
the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they
could not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope
him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not
have been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of
Alexander,[5] everything would have been different to him. On the day
that Julius the Second[6] was elected, he told me that he had thought
of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had
provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that,
when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.

 [5] Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.

 [6] Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad
 Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.

When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to
blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to
offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of
others, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and
far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and
only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness
frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to
secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome
either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the
people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate
those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of
things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to
destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship
with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal
and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the
actions of this man.

Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he
made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope
to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected
Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any
cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they
became pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom
he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna,
San Giorgio, and Ascanio.[7] The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear
him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their
relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the
kingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above
everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and,
failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad
Vincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages
to forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his
choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.

CHAPTER VIII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS


Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither
of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is
manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be
more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are
when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the
principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private
person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first
method, it will be illustrated by two examples—one ancient, the other
modern—and without entering further into the subject, I consider these
two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.

Agathocles, the Sicilian,[1] became King of Syracuse not only from a
private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a
potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous
life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of
mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,
he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established
in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself
prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that
which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding
for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army,
was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the
senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating
to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the
senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held
the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he
was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not
only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for
its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time
raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme
necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and,
leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.

 [1] Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.

Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will
see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as
he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any
one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were
gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly
held by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent
to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,
without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not
glory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and
extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his
greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be
seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.
Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite
wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent
men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.

In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da
Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by
his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his
youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his
discipline, he might attain some high position in the military
profession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,
and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body
and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a
paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some
citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than
its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So
he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many
years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look
upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire
anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he
had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would
be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and
he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably
by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also
to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.

Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,
and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he
lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having
arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a
solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of
Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual
in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave
discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son
Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and
others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to
be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a
chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after
him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places
and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,
mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief
magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to
obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the
prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and
strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a
way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only
was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all
his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as
that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by
Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia,
as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this
parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made
his leader in valour and wickedness.

Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after
infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his
country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be
conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by
means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold
the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this
follows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be
called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are
applied at one blow and are necessary to one’s security, and that are
not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage
of the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding
they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than
decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God
or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is
impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.

 [2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern
 equivalent of Machiavelli’s thought when he speaks of “crudelta” than
 the more obvious “cruelties.”

Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought
to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for
him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to
repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to
reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does
otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to
keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor
can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and
repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so
that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given
little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.

And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such
a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall
make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled
times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help
you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be
under any obligation to you for them.




CHAPTER IX.
CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY


But coming to the other point—where a leading citizen becomes the
prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,
but by the favour of his fellow citizens—this may be called a civil
principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain
to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a
principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the
favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties
are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be
ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and
oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in
cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or
anarchy.

A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,
accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the
nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the
reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that
under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people,
finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of
one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his
authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles
maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the
aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around
him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can
neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches
sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around
him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.

Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,
satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is
more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,
while the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added
also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people,
because of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure
himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect
from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile
nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will
rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and
astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain
favours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is
compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well
without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and
to give or take away authority when it pleases him.

Therefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to
be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape
their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or
they do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought
to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt
with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a
natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,
especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in
prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.
But when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it
is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,
and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they
were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.

Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people
ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only
ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the
people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above
everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may
easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they
receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more
closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more
devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their
favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as
these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules,
so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the
people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.

Nabis,[1] Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,
and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his
country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was
only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this
would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not
let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that “He who
builds on the people, builds on the mud,” for this is true when a
private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that
the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the
magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as
happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali[2] in
Florence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above,
who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who
does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and
energy, keeps the whole people encouraged—such a one will never find
himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his
foundations well.

These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from
the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either
rule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their
government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on
the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and
who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with
great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not
the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the
citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates,
are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will
always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For
such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when
citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with
him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to
die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its
citizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this
experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore
a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will
always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state
and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.




CHAPTER X.
CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO
BE MEASURED


It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of
these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in
case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether
he has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite
clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by
their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise
a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack
them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot
show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to
defend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been
discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second
case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision
and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.
And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the
other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often
repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are
always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it
will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town
well fortified, and is not hated by his people.

The cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country
around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits
them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,
because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the
taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they
have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they
always keep in public depots enough for one year’s eating, drinking,
and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss
to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the
community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city,
and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold
military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to
uphold them.

Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself
odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only
be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this
world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a
whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever
should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it
burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and
self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that
a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by
giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for
long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving
himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.

Further, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin
the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot
and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the
prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the
damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer
any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with
their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that
their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his
defence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they
confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is
well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the
minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not
fail to support and defend them.




CHAPTER XI.
CONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES


It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching
which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they
are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held
without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of
religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the
principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.
These princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have
subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are
not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,
and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate
themselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being
upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak
no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would
be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.

Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church
has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from
Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have
been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)
have valued the temporal power very slightly—yet now a king of France
trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and
to ruin the Venetians—although this may be very manifest, it does not
appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.

Before Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,[1] this country was
under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the
Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal
anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms;
the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those
about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.
To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as
it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made
use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini
and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with
arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate
weak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a
courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could
rid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a
cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a
pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to
speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would
arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet
would not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the
temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.

 [1] Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.

Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have
ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to
prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by
reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things
which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although
his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,
nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,
which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all
his labours.

Pope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all
the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the
chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the
way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been
practised before Alexander’s time. Such things Julius not only
followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin
the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these
enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,
inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any
private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within
the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them
some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm:
the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and
the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused
the disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their
cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster
the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to
support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders
and tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope
Leo[2] found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that,
if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more
venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.

 [2] Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de’ Medici.




CHAPTER XII.
HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES


Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such
principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having
considered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and
having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and
to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of
offence and defence which belong to each of them.

We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his
foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to
ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or
composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good
laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are
well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the
discussion and shall speak of the arms.

I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state
are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.
Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds
his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for
they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,
valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the
fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so
long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war
by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for
keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to
make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your
soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take
themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble
to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by
resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they
formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet
when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that
Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in
hand;[1] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the
truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have
related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who
have also suffered the penalty.

 [1] “With chalk in hand,” “col gesso.” This is one of the _bons mots_
 of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized
 Italy, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his
 quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the
 country. _Cf_. “The History of Henry VII,” by Lord Bacon: “King
 Charles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a
 kind of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy
 without resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont
 to say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands,
 to mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.”

I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The
mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,
you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own
greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others
contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are
ruined in the usual way.

And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,
whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted
to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in
person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its
citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it
ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so
that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes
and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and
mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to
bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its
citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and
Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely
armed and quite free.

Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who
were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the
Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.
After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of
their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their
liberty.

Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against
the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,[2]
allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His
father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna[3] of Naples, left
her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms
of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the
Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these
arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have
defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been
favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have
stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and
others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer
was Giovanni Acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot
be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the
Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the
Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco
turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the
kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while
ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most
prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest
renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have
been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became
the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if
they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their
achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and
gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed
gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned
to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they
forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the
beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much
territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to
fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under
Carmignuola,[5] they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him
a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),
and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they
feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they
were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to
lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order
to secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their
captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of
Pitigliano,[6] and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not
gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,[7] where in one battle they lost
that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much
trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed
and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.

 [3] Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of Naples.

 [4] Giovanni Acuto. An English knight whose name was Sir John
 Hawkwood. He fought in the English wars in France, and was knighted by
 Edward III; afterwards he collected a body of troops and went into
 Italy. These became the famous “White Company.” He took part in many
 wars, and died in Florence in 1394. He was born about 1320 at Sible
 Hedingham, a village in Essex. He married Domnia, a daughter of
 Bernabo Visconti.

 [5] Carmignuola. Francesco Bussone, born at Carmagnola about 1390,
 executed at Venice, 5th May 1432.

 [6] Bartolomeo Colleoni of Bergamo; died 1457. Roberto of San
 Severino; died fighting for Venice against Sigismund, Duke of Austria,
 in 1487. “Primo capitano in Italia.”—Machiavelli. Count of Pitigliano;
 Nicolo Orsini, born 1442, died 1510.

 [7] Battle of Vaila in 1509.

And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled
for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,
in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better
prepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has
recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired
more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more
states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms
against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were
oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain
authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became
princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the
hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of
priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both
commenced to enlist foreigners.

The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,[8]
the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others,
Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After
these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms
of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been
overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted
by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to
lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.
They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory,
they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not
give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a
moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs
were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand
soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They
had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to
themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking
prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at
night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night;
they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did
they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their
military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both
fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and
contempt.

 Romagna. He was the leader of the famous “Company of St George,”
 composed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in 1409.




CHAPTER XIII.
CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE’S OWN


Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a
prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by
Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise
against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to
auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,[1] for his
assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in
themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always
disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their
captive.

 [1] Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples),
 surnamed “The Catholic,” born 1452, died 1516.

And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish
to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which
cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw
himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune
brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his
rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the
Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all
expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not
become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his
auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.

The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand
Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other
time of their troubles.

The Emperor of Constantinople,[2] to oppose his neighbours, sent ten
thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not
willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to
the infidels.

 [2] Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.

Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,
for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them
the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to
others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and
better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one
community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you
have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough
authority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most
dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has
always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing
rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming
that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.

I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke
entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French
soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards,
such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries,
discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli;
whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and
dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference
between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one
considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when
he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he
relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and
found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when
every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.

I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am
unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I
have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by
the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted
like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him
that he could neither keep them nor let them go, he had them all cut to
pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with
aliens.

I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament
applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with
Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed
him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them
on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to
meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of
others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind
you fast.

Charles the Seventh,[3] the father of King Louis the Eleventh,[4]
having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English,
recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he
established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and
infantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and
began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as
is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised
the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of
his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his
men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so
accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they
can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot
stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come
off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become
mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms
together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone,
but much inferior to one’s own forces. And this example proves it, for
the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of
Charles had been enlarged or maintained.

 [3] Charles VII of France, surnamed “The Victorious,” born 1403, died
 1461.

 [4] Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.

But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks
well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I
have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a
principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not
truly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster
to the Roman Empire[5] should be examined, it will be found to have
commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time
the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour
which had raised it passed away to others.

 [5] “Many speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the
 reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of
 the conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence.
 When Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank
 under the weight of its military obligations, he said that this was
 ‘wholly unhistorical.’ He might well have added that the Roman power
 was at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to
 fight for the State, but that it began to decline as soon as this
 obligation was no longer recognised.”—_Pall Mall Gazette_, 15th May
 1906.

I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having
its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good
fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And
it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing
can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own
strength. And one’s own forces are those which are composed either of
subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or
auxiliaries. And the way to make ready one’s own forces will be easily
found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one
will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many
republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which
rules I entirely commit myself.




CHAPTER XIV.
THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR


A prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything
else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is
the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force
that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often
enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the
contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than
of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing
it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is
to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from
a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding
the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.
For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to
be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince
ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing
proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not
reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him
who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed
servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other
suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And
therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and
above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by
his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to
have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should
addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two
ways, the one by action, the other by study.

As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well
organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he
accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of
localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the
valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of
rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which
knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his
country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by
means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands
with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study
hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and
marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance
to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of
one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the
prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable
that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his
enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to
besiege towns to advantage.

Philopoemen,[1] Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which
writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he
never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in
the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If
the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here
with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best
advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,
how ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went,
all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their
opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these
continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any
unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.

 [1] Philopoemen, “the last of the Greeks,” born 252 B.C., died 183
 B.C.

But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and
study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne
themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,
so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as
an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been
praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he
always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated
Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of
Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of
Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity,
affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things
which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to
observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but
increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be
available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find
him prepared to resist her blows.




CHAPTER XV.
CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR
BLAMED


It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a
prince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have
written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in
mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from
the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a
thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me
more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the
imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities
which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is
so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is
done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his
preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his
professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much
that is evil.

Hence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how
to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.
Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince,
and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are
spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are
remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or
praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly,
using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is
still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly
who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed
generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless,
another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave;
one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one
sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another
frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know
that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a
prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but
because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human
conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently
prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which
would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,
from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he
may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need
not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without
which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is
considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like
virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which
looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.




CHAPTER XVI.
CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS


Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I
say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless,
liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation
for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should
be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the
reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among
men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of
magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts
all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to
maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax
them, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him
odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by
any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded
few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by
whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing
to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being
miserly.

Therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of
liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if
he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in
time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that
with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself
against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without
burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises
liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless,
and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.

We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have
been considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was
assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he
did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King
of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax
on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his
long thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken
or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A
prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that
he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he
is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a
reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will
enable him to govern.

And if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and
many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,
and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact,
or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is
dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;
and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;
but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his
expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should
reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,
who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends
that which is his own or his subjects’ or else that of others. In the
first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to
neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes
forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion,
handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,
otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is
neither yours nor your subjects’ you can be a ready giver, as were
Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your
reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only
squandering your own that injures you.

And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst
you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor
or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a
prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised
and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to
have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,
than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to
incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.




CHAPTER XVII.
CONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED
THAN FEARED


Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every
prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.
Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare
Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled
the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if
this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more
merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for
cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.[1] Therefore a prince, so
long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the
reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more
merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to
arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to
injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a
prince offend the individual only.

 [1] During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi
 factions in 1502 and 1503.

And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the
imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence
Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign
owing to its being new, saying:

“Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt
Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.”[2]

Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he
himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and
humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and
too much distrust render him intolerable.

 [2] . . . against my will, my fate
A throne unsettled, and an infant state,
Bid me defend my realms with all my pow’rs,
And guard with these severities my shores.

Christopher Pitt.

Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than
feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to
be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it
is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be
dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that
they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as
you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,
property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far
distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince
who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other
precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by
payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be
earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied
upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than
one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation
which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for
their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which
never fails.

Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he
does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well
being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he
abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their
women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of
someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,
but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,
because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss
of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are
never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always
find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for
taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner
lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a
multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard
the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army
united or disposed to its duties.

Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that
having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to
fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or
against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This
arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his
boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his
soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not
sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his
deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal
cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been
sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most
excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,
against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from
nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more
license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was
upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of
the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,
yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate
punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in
the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew
much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This
disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have
destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the
control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed
itself, but contributed to his glory.

Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the
conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing
according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself
on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must
endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.




CHAPTER XVIII.[1]
CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH


 [1] “The present chapter has given greater offence than any other
 portion of Machiavelli’s writings.” Burd, “Il Principe,” p. 297.

Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and
to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience
has been that those princes who have done great things have held good
faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect
of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on
their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one
by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the
second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,
it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is
necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast
and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient
writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were
given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his
discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who
was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know
how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not
durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the
beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot
defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against
wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares
and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do
not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor
ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,
and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If
men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they
are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to
observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince
legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless
modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and
engagements have been made void and of no effect through the
faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the
fox has succeeded best.

 [2] “Contesting,” _i.e_. “striving for mastery.” Mr Burd points out
 that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero’s “De Officiis”:
 “Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum
 per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum
 est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.”

But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,
and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and
so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will
always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent
example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing
else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he
always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power
in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would
observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to
his wishes,[3] because he well understood this side of mankind.

 [3] “Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).” The
 words “ad votum” are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.

Alexander never did what he said,
Cesare never said what he did.

Italian Proverb.

Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities
I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And
I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe
them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear
merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with
a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able
and know how to change to the opposite.

And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,
cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often
forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,[4]
friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him
to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and
variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to
diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then
to know how to set about it.

 [4] “Contrary to fidelity” or “faith,” “contro alla fede,” and “tutto
 fede,” “altogether faithful,” in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy
 that these two phrases, “contro alla fede” and “tutto fede,” were
 omitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction
 of the papal authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the
 word “fede” was “the faith,” _i.e_. the Catholic creed, and not as
 rendered here “fidelity” and “faithful.” Observe that the word
 “religione” was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being
 used to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness “the
 religion,” a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot
 heresy. South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this
 passage as follows: “That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,
 Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political
 scheme: ‘That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but
 the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.’”

For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything
slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five
qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether
merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing
more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as
men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it
belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.
Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and
those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who
have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all
men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge,
one judges by the result.

For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding
his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be
praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a
thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are
only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have
no ground to rest on.

One prince[5] of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never
preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most
hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of
reputation and kingdom many a time.

 would have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand’s name here
 without giving offence.” Burd’s “Il Principe,” p. 308.




CHAPTER XIX.
THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED


Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I
have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss
briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has
been in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him
hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will
have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other
reproaches.

It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,
and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from
both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor
their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has
only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease
in many ways.

It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,
effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince
should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in
his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his
private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are
irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can
hope either to deceive him or to get round him.

That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,
and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,
provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by
his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a
prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his
subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From
the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,
and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will
always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they
should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should
affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations
and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will
resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.

But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has
only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can
easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by
keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for
him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most
efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not
to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a
prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the
conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have
the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a
conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the
conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires
cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he
believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to
a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content
himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so
that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the
other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare
friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith
with you.

And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side
of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of
punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the
majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and
the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the
popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to
conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the
execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to
the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and
thus cannot hope for any escape.

Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content
with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer
Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the
present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had
conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer
Giovanni,[1] who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination
the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the
popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in
Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after
the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese,
having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in
Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a
blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of
their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due
course to the government.

 [1] Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508. He
 ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli’s strong condemnation of
 conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience
 (February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his
 alleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.

For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies
of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is
hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear
everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have
taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep
the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most
important objects a prince can have.

Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France,
and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty
and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its
authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of
the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths
would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the
hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to
protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care
of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be
liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people
for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who
could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the
king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or
a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can
draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs
of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in
their own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish
the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.

It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths
of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to
my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great
qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have
been killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing,
therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of
some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were
not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only
submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who
studies the affairs of those times.

It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to
the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were
Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son
Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.

There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the
ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be
contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to
put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so
beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard
thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the
people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring
prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold,
cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should
exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give
vent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors
were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great
authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the
principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,
were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about
injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes
cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to
avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they
ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the
most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had
need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the
people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,
accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.

From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being
all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,
and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died
honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,
and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,
being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always
kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated
nor despised.

But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,
who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not
endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,
having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt
for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his
administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as
much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a
prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for
when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain
yourself—it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles—you
have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works
will do you harm.

But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,
that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in
the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by
him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who
allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the
army conspired against him, and murdered him.

Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus
Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and
rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to
commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except
Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour
that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed
by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much
admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were
kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and
satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were
great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the
fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a
prince to imitate.

Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in
Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to
Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the
praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to
aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy
before it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the
Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this
there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the
whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the
Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in
the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he
considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided
to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that,
being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that
dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that
the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted
by Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger,
and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the
Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had
received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this
ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him
out in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will,
therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a
most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and
respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be
wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well,
because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which
the people might have conceived against him for his violence.

But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent
qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and
acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of
fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which
caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and
cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single
murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those
of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by
those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the
midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that
such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and
desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who
does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the
less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do
any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the
service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had
contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily
threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was
a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor’s ruin.

But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to
hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and
he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his
people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave
himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he
might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not
maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete
with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the
imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being
hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against
and was killed.

It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike
man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,
of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the
throne. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated
and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought
him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great
indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to
his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the
imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity
by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,
practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at
the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa
rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy
conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,
besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were
disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so
many against him, murdered him.

I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being
thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this
discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this
difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far
less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some
indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that
are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were
the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary
to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more
necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy
the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more
powerful.

From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him
twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend
the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,
putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them
his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in
the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the
people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state
of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that
it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an
hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old
prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by
those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this
being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality,
because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in
new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state
is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its
hereditary lord.

But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will
consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been
fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how
it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in
another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to
unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for
Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was
heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly
destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated
Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in
his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot
imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow
those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which
are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are
proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and
firm.




CHAPTER XX.
ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT,
ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?


1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their
subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;
others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid
themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning
of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown
and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on
all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those
states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as
comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.

2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather
when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by
arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted
become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your
subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be
armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be
handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they
quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,
considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and
service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm
them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either
for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions
breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it
follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character
already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient
to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.
Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has
always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a
prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old
one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those
who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time
and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters
should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state
shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.

3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed
to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by
fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their
tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This
may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way
balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for
to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;
rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided
cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always
assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The
Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the
Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although
they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these
disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their
differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not
afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one
party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,
therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be
permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the
more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but
if war comes this policy proves fallacious.

4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the
difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore
fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who
has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes
enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may
have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher,
as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many
consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with
craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed
it, his renown may rise higher.

5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and
assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were
distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo
Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been
distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak
generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say
this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been
hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support
themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they
will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as
they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad
impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always
extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too
much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands
it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours
has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which
induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural
affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then
he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for
it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons
for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern
affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends
of those men who were contented under the former government, and are
therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it,
were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.

6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states
more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit
to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of
refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been
made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in
our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello
so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on
returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia,
razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and
considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the
Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses,
therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you
good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be
reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than
from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear
from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The
castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make,
more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the
state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by
the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they
will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be
wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.
It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use
to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,[1] when the Count
Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to
withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and
thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that
time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses
were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her,
and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore,
it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have
been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these
things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as
well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them,
cares little about being hated by the people.

 [1] Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia
 Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the Countess of Forli that
 Machiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499. A letter from Fortunati to the
 countess announces the appointment: “I have been with the signori,”
 wrote Fortunati, “to learn whom they would send and when. They tell me
 that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine noble, secretary
 to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me at once.” _Cf_. “Catherine
 Sforza,” by Count Pasolini, translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.




CHAPTER XXI.
HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN


Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and
setting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the
present King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he
has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be
the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds
you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the
beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the
foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without
any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile
occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;
thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power
and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and
of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the
foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.
Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater
schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and
clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable
example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,
he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his
achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the
minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the
issue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of
the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against
him.

Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal
affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da
Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life
doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some
method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.
And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action
to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.

A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a
downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he
declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course
will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two
of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character
that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In
either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare
yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if
you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the
conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been
conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to
protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want
doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who
loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in
hand, court his fate.

Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Ætolians to drive out
the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the
Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the
Romans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed
in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged
them to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: “As for that
which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your
state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous;
because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or
consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.” Thus it will always
happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality,
whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with
arms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally
follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince
declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with
whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful
and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is
established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to
become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all
are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard,
especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you
may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you
become companions on a fortune that may rise again.

In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that
you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it
greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of
one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved
him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with
your assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be
noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with
one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others,
unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers
you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as
possible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with
France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their
ruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as
happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to
attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince
ought to favour one of the parties.

Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe
courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,
because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid
one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in
knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to
take the lesser evil.

A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour
the proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his
citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and
agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not
be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken
away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but
the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things
and designs in any way to honour his city or state.

Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles
at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into
guilds or into societies,[1] he ought to hold such bodies in esteem,
and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of
courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty
of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.

 [1] “Guilds or societies,” “in arti o in tribu.” “Arti” were craft or
 trade guilds, _cf_. Florio: “Arte . . . a whole company of any trade
 in any city or corporation town.” The guilds of Florence are most
 admirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject
 (Methuen, 1906). Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called
 “artel,” exist in Russia to-day, _cf_. Sir Mackenzie Wallace’s
 “Russia,” ed. 1905: “The sons . . . were always during the working
 season members of an artel. In some of the larger towns there are
 artels of a much more complex kind— permanent associations, possessing
 large capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the
 individual members.” The word “artel,” despite its apparent
 similarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with “ars”
 or “arte.” Its root is that of the verb “rotisya,” to bind oneself by
 an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of
 “rota,” which now signifies a “regimental company.” In both words the
 underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. “Tribu”
 were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included
 individuals connected by marriage. Perhaps our words “sects” or
 “clans” would be most appropriate.




CHAPTER XXII.
CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES


The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they
are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the
first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is
by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and
faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to
recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are
otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error
which he made was in choosing them.

There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of
Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to
be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there
are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;
another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which
neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first
is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.
Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the
first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know
good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have
the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his
servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the
servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.

But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one
test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his
own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in
everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you
ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in
his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince,
and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not
concerned.

On the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study
him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with
him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he
cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,
many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him
dread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,
are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,
the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.




CHAPTER XXIII.
HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED


I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it
is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless
they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of
whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own
affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with
difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they
run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way
of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that
to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell
you the truth, respect for you abates.

Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the
wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking
the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,
and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and
listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With
these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry
himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more
freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of
these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be
steadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either
overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions
that he falls into contempt.

I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of
affairs to Maximilian,[1] the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,
said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.
This arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the
above; for the emperor is a secretive man—he does not communicate his
designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in
carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at
once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being
pliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he
does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he
wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.

 [1] Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman
 Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after
 her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in Italian
 politics.

A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he
wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every
one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to
be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning
the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any
consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be
felt.

And if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression
of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good
advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived,
because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not
wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has
yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very
prudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would
not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take
away his state from him.

But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more
than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to
unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests,
and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through
them. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always
prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.
Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they
come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the
prince from good counsels.




CHAPTER XXIV.
WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES


The previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince
to appear well established, and render him at once more secure and
fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the
actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an
hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men
and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more
by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good
they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost
defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will
be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and
adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and
with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a
prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.

And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in
Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and
others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in
regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in
the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the
people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known
how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that
have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.

Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who
was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the
greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a
warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles,
he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the
end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the
kingdom.

Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their
principalities after so many years’ possession, but rather their own
sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a
change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the
calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they
thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that
the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would
recall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very
bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would
never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later
on to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does,
it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no
avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable,
certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.




CHAPTER XXV.
WHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER


It is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the
opinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by
fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and
that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us
believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let
chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times
because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may
still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes
pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.
Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true
that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,[1] but that she
still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.

 [1] Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: “The older one gets the
 more convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does
 three-quarters of the business of this miserable universe.” Sorel’s
 “Eastern Question.”

I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood
overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away
the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to
its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,
though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when
the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences
and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass
away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so
dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour
has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where
she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain
her.

And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and
which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open
country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been
defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either
this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it
would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say
concerning resistance to fortune in general.

But confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be
seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change
of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from
causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the
prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I
believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions
according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not
accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in
affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely,
glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,
another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience,
another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by
a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain
his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different
observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other
impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they
conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from
what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same
effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the
other does not.

Changes in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs
himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a
way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if
times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course
of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to
know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot
deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having
always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it
is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time
to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined;
but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have
changed.

Pope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and
found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of
action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise
against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The
Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he
had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France;
nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his
accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the
Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the
former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand,
he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having
observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as
to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore
Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff
with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome
until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed,
as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.
Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the
others would have raised a thousand fears.

I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they
all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience
the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go
cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have
deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.

I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind
steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are
successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider
that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a
woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and
ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by
the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She
is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they
are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.




CHAPTER XXVI.
AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS


Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and
wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a
new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an
opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of
things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this
country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new
prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.

And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be
captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians
should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the
soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate
the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to
discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy
should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should
be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,
more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,
despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.

Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us
think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was
afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected
him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet
heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of
Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany,
and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she
entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs
and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and
willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.

Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope
than in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and fortune,
favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and
which could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be
difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the
men I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet
they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the
present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier
than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.

 [1] Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal by Leo X.
 In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement VII.

With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is
necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in
them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness
is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those
men to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how
extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:
the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth
water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your
greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do
everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory
which belongs to us.

And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians
have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious
house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many
campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted,
this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and
none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man
more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was
newly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will
make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting
opportunities to bring such into use in every form.

Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.
Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how
superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But
when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs
entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are
capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there
having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by
valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for
so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years,
whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a
poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro,
afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.[2]

 [2] The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501;
 Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.

If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable
men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,
as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own
forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better
soldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be
much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,
honoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is
necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended
against foreigners by Italian valour.

And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very
formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which
a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be
relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry,
and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in
close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the
Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are
overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this
latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at
the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by
German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the
Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in
under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack,
while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed
up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore,
knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one,
which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not
create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are
the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new
prince.

This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for
letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the
love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have
suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for
revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.
What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?
What envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To
all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your
illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with
which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard
our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be
verified that saying of Petrarch:

Virtu contro al Furore
    Prendera l’arme, e fia il combatter corto:
Che l’antico valore
    Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.

Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,
    And it i’ th’ combat soon shall put to flight:
For the old Roman valour is not dead,
    Nor in th’ Italians’ brests extinguished.

Edward Dacre, 1640.




DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING
VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE
DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI

BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI


The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to
clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been
raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of
Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola,
whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against
Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring
that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his
Romagnian duchy.

These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and
their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too
powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek
to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon
this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to
which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,
Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the
tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo
Petrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and
courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which
might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they
decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the
Florentines; and they sent their men to one place and another,
promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite
with them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported
throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke,
among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a
revolution.

Thus it arose that, men’s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by
certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held
for the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The
castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;
so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being
carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from
being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping
upon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being
effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being
encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the
Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.

Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose
the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any
town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and
they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in
destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and
that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.

But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli
and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo
Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the
duke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola,
because, against everybody’s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone
over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.
But recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided
to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to
him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.
This latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France
for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into
cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.

Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached
Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the
aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the
duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with
offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did
not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he
wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough
for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the
principality.

And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to
him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a
standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every
care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such
preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in
separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there
came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found
himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open
war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to
outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of
reconciliation.

And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in
which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand
ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed
an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come
personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the
other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and
other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and
not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his
permission.

This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,
again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his
state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the
fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by
the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.
But the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed
his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of
November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to
Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the
Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of
Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but
nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that
if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were
ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To
this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with
Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was
very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.

It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the
fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give
it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to
come there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being
invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no
suspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French
men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred
lancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena
about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost
cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for
him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance
would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the
reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the
arms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very
stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not
offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by
Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he
agreed to wait.

Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on
30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most
trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor
d’Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as
Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should
arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting
certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they
reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they
came to the duke’s quarters, where they should be seized.

The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which
there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to
assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from
Fano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day
of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of
about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the
infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.

Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of
the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who
goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases
of which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia
is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot
and from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs
a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards
Fano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes
for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river
which passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank
of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge
which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that
leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before
this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which
the bank of the river forms one side.

The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and
to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant
from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men
of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,
which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty
horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters
having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and
when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass
over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and
the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through
which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.

Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a
few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a
cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his
approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the
man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that
when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet
the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He
recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his
nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of
their fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came
before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him
with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were
commissioned to look after them.

But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band
in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square
before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and
drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care
of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that
Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined
Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of
their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;
and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come
himself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice,
came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and
Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.

So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s
quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made
them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that
the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.
Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of
the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment
of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves,
and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and
Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the
country and saved themselves.

But the duke’s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men
of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not
repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have
completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,
the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a
room and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in
keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of
the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the
blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the
Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome
that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of
Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th
January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the
same way.




THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA

WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI

And sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI

CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328


It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who
have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,
who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in
their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and
obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.
They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have
had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to
be sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate
who these persons may have been because they are well known to
everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to
those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly
beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to
the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because
she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in
their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio
Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is
measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was
born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished
in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to
be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such
indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar
to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his
actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.

The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families
of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in
estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a
son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca,
and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He
had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but
Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again
went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the
house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens,
any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning,
shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio
was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather
herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the
leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard
something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards
it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the
leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and
partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it
to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is
customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When
he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised
or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves
what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no
children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for
it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They
baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As
the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of
wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those
lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended
to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his
canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with
this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio
was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached
the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of
Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left
off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,
delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in
running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he
far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at
any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of
wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with
vexation and sorrow.

There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,
named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,
bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had
often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a
Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman
resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most
mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the
top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he
had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street
in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far
excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal
authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer
Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being
informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt
a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one
day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of
a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in
the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the
services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased
Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he
stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer
Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,
nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and
take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and
in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was
driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear
that he would not be able to hold him much longer.

Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to
the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was
astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that
virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true
gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and
could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and
tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,
and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what
enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful
modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to
others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his
equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved,
not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio
had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia
by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist
the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.
Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this
expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and
his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all
Lombardy.

Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he
left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many
friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary
for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son
thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to
be his son’s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died
Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that
goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to
the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the
father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and
tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and
created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the
former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring
tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli
Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of
Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him
that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and
holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;
therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of
his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but
afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able
to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples
and have him driven out of Lucca.

The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,
who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became
their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,
with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting
their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought
into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of
the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio
cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies
and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few
days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon
with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and
Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed
Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the
portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling
the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione
entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer
Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The
governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the
wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found
that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those
who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the
headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most
hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.

As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party
that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they
determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a
large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence
they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into
Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and
with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved
against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the
enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between
Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to
Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight
skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.
Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed
coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing
worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army
in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the
Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain
had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and
allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also
showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the
camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the
more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in
the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently,
deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered
their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a
few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the
certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio
had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre
of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the
army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant
men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he
moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his
lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had
come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre
squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the
wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings
of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained
out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were
separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach
each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s men
were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and the most
efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines
were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or
to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much
difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the
centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to
attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat
was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten
thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party
in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom
were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and
Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did
not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco,
the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the
first onset.

This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that
Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it
appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of
power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only
waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the
death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in
Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.
On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were
driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming
to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him
a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his
son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take
Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,
fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was
entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing
to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,
in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.
Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once
set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the
business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the
Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo
della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard
of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn
back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should
close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what
had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand
the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had
arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private
circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised
a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded
that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse
might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered
his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked
Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away
with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in
poverty.

But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,
and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people
that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having
obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the
recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of
Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded
a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed
a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course
of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained
at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a
short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the
pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and
wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the
lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed
by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any
longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord
of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico,
Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had
corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected
prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of
the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and
Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at
the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in
Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the
people’s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in
great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,
and he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time
the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had
driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.
Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread
of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were
constrained to accept him as their lord.

Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian
affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian
Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio
for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his
country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these
exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi,
and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.
Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all
Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to
gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer
Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces
of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he
divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied
with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he
could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without
those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he
surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer
Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven
out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the
King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the
Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home,
they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to
defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized
Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.
Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely
reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to
return to Lucca.

There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so
powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance
him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not
received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited
other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They
found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set
upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and
killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano
di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion,
intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms;
and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him
what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater
intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the
news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in
command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.
Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he
posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As
it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to
him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,
for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to
pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their
former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to
their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged
Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure
to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to
hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to
him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of
showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and
Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown
into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered
San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace,
as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to
leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce,
which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and
desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded
with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the
conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble,
turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should
not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he,
under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by
their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of
them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had
in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that
none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he
raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom
he had killed or hunted out of the state.

Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his
position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of
increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he
could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence,
which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends
with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both
parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it
always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the
Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each
of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each
desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many
threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the
Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city;
both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they
believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than
the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave
promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and
to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the
appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself
direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and
both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a
signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other
Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans
of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the
hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the
palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them
many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to
the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and
quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great
valour.

About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness
of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.
The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders
and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put
an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should
call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of
the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he
could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not
only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.
Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the
emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be
safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo
Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six
hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest
distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such
respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order
was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from
the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the
source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders,
and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.
Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This
dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in
a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its
front: “I am what God wills.” Whilst on the back was: “What God desires
shall be.”

During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio
should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could
tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be
difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were
Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face
danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia,
and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and
after driving out some of Castruccio’s officials and partisans, and
killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this
greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on
in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return,
knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with
their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so
they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the
supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian
territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his
army; and having heard where the Florentines’ lay, he decided not to
encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of
Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the
Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design,
victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had
thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he
had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops,
yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be
overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and
Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the
exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places
narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still
narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that
twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was
Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had
been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to
the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them
wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of
neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons,
and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able
to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to
fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and
there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force
before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this
trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which
possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate
friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with
him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle
the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put
to death.

Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the
Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away
from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his
army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they
reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill
on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the
castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching
from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of
Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the
hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his
infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a
path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four
hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never
expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they
aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the
Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise
when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they
upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case
of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed
with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,
although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting
reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The
cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were
unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the
narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought
to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were
engaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without
having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate
position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout
resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both
flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their
friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a
decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand
infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred
horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole
force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried
out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,
but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their
unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the
rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man
seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very
sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini
dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all
Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on
the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the
Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out
the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not
content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both
sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,
about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the
spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding
horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in
commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to
corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city
gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the
participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci
and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great
anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys
to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and
he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph
cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to
receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and
he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.

Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the
pressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled to leave
his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a
conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,
one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland
should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this
conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of
Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy
paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few
are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy
Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.
This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio
Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering
their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put
him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their
families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and
Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and
energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines
their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of
Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided
to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty
thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid
every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should
attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to
march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more
likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed
that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.

In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army
and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from
thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army
which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree
alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would
deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to
think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects
of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand
foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to
Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand
infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the
Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and
Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.
Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they
divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the
direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or
attack Castruccio’s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they
would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his
own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they
would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,
an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to
take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of
the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide
expanse of land between them and the river.

The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to
decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,
having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the
latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet
the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the
saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the
Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of
cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was
fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines
with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing
them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one
thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the
Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their
arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the
river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more
difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having
broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of
the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so
fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the
difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved
higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and
the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by
the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light
armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with
tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,
alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and
trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of
Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp
and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither
would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back
into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land
in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they
could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this
obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio
shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had
before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each
other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length
Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his
men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many
killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up
a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded
these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and
one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This
cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and
thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these
tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s
reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into
the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any
decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his
inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the
defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that
when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work
of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the
Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder
of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with
lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the
enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine
captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in
crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower
down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio’s army. But
here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of
Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines
were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them
escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains
were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with
Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine
commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter
was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the
Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men,
whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.

But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his
life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus
ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry
into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but
death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle
the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued
and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on
their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the
watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;
he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be
the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio
stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the
Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of
which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it
was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with
high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must
prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and
addressed him as follows:

“If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the
midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my
successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left
thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,
because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and
Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the
Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these
peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least
more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but
one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who
insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me
with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time
to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have
never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a
boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should
feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been
born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and
capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been
witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all
his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love,
and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And
in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy
father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained,
I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect
my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.
Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am
deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.
Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest
contented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are
of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be
sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under
a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with
factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs
recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended
Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly
destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than
they would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the
princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far
distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou
hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory
of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought
thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist
thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering
under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And
whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that
war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every
inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring
thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this
world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own
strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for
fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be
well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this
way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this
thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I
have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that
I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”

After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,
and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending
Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his
successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him,
and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he
was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he
was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to
Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the
abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa,
and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This
latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the
great-grandson of Pagolo.

From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a
man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time,
but also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the
ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious
presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke
with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,
and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or
snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,
but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false
with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he
desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory
that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was
bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He
was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear
nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees
that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully
sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look
for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not
angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that
he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on
the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a
partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom
Castruccio had said: “You would not have given more than a penny.”
“That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A
ducat is much less to me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had
spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman
are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that
they may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by
spittle that I may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by
Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it
was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be
a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our
saints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of
a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:
“Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest
into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo
and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which
gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed
to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those
who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather
like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest
need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much
disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for
cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear
anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since
every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one
what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a
banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon
another.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,
Castruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many
things.” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming
intoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was
acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being
blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be
taken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken
her.” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:
“Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true,
he continued: “Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.”
Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of
Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a
chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers
and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some
saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much
disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to
offend thee less.” Being asked how Caesar died he said: “God willing I
will die as he did.” Being one night in the house of one of his
gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of
his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was
usual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by
day will not be considered a fool at night.” A person came to demand a
favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea
threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by
Castruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast
thy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had
asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,
seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled
blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous
words, he said to him: “When you have another request to make, send
someone else to make it.” Having been wearied by a similar man with a
long oration who wound up by saying: “Perhaps I have fatigued you by
speaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You have not, because I have not
listened to a word you said.” He used to say of one who had been a
beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was
dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he
took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he
said: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is
unfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco
Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give you if
you will let me give you a blow on the nose?” Castruccio answered: “A
helmet.” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been
instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done
wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived
themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly
those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying
that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused
when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise
that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first
to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with
only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to
be buried when he died, and answered: “With the face turned downwards,
for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.” On
being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order
to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared
strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione
della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat
to preserve his health, and replied: “If the man be rich let him eat
when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.” Seeing one of his
gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: “I
pray God that you will let him feed you also.” Seeing that someone had
written upon his house in Latin the words: “May God preserve this house
from the wicked,” he said, “The owner must never go in.” Passing
through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,
and remarked: “That house will fly through the door.” He was having a
discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the
property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them,
and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. “Is this
king of yours a bad man or a good one?” asked Castruccio, and was told
that he was a good one, whereupon he said, “Why should you suggest that
I should be afraid of a good man?”

I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and
weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his
high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a
prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,
so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;
therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be
seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they
were placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in
his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of
Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his
age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had
Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia
or Rome.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius

by Niccolo Machiavelli

CITIZEN AND SECRETARY OF FLORENCE

TRANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN BY

NINIAN HILL THOMSON, M.A.


LONDON KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH & CO., 1, PATERNOSTER SQUARE 1883


TO PROFESSOR PASQUALE VILLARI.

DEAR PROFESSOR VILLARI,


Permit me to inscribe your name on a translation of Machiavelli’s
Discourses which I had your encouragement to undertake, and in which I
have done my best to preserve something of the flavour of the original.
Yours faithfully,

NINIAN HILL THOMSON.


FLORENCE, May 17, 1883.

BOOK I.

PREFACE

CHAPTER


I. Of the beginnings of Cities in general, and in particular of that of
Rome

II. Of the various kinds of Government; and to which of them the Roman
Commonwealth belonged

III. Of the accidents which led in Rome to the creation of Tribunes of
the People, whereby the Republic was made more perfect

IV. That the dissensions between the Senate and Commons of Rome made
Rome free and powerful

V. Whether the guardianship of public freedom is safer in the hands of
the Commons or of the Nobles; and whether those who seek to acquire
power, or they who seek to maintain it, are the greater cause of
commotions

VI. Whether it was possible in Rome to contrive such a Government as
would have composed the differences between the Commons and the Senate

VII. That to preserve liberty in a State, there must exist the right to
accuse

VIII. That calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the power to
accuse is useful

IX. That to give new institutions to a Commonwealth, or to reconstruct
old institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work of one Man

X. That in proportion as the founder of a Kingdom or Commonwealth
merits praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves blame

XI. Of the Religion of the Romans

XII. That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and that
Italy, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been ruined

XIII. Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving institutions to
their City; in carrying out their enterprises; and in quelling tumults

XIV. That the Romans interpreted the auspices to meet the occasion; and
made a prudent show of observing the rites of Religion even when forced
to disregard them; and any who rashly slighted Religion they punished

XV. How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken fortunes, had
recourse to Religion

XVI. That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by any
accident it become free, can hardly preserve that freedom

XVII. That a corrupt People obtaining freedom can hardly preserve it

XVIII. How a free Government existing in a corrupt City may be
preserved, or not existing may be created

XIX. After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself: but
after one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second

XX. That the consecutive reigns of two valiant Princes produce great
results: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a
succession of valiant Rulers by whom their power and growth are rapidly
extended

XXI. That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a Commonwealth to be
without a National Army

XXII. What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman Horatii and
the three Alban Curiatii

XXIII. That we should never hazard our whole fortunes, where we put not
forth our entire strength; for which reason to guard a defile is often
hurtful

XXIV. That well-ordered States always provide rewards and punishments
for their Citizens; and never set off deserts against misdeeds

XXV. That he who would reform the institutions of a free State, must
retain at least the semblance of old ways

XXVI. That a new Prince in a city or province of which he has taken
possession, ought to make everything new

XXVII. That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly bad

XXVIII. Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to their
citizens than were the Athenians

XXIX. Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful

XXX. How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of ingratitude;
and how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by it

XXXI. That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme severity
for misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely through
their ignorance or want of judgment, were not punished at all

XXXII. That a Prince or Commonwealth should not defer benefits until
they are forced to yield them

XXXIII. When a mischief has grown up in, or against a State, it is
safer to temporize with it than to meet it with violence

XXXIV. That the authority of the Dictator did good and not harm to the
Roman Republic; and that it is, not those powers which are given by the
free suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious Citizens usurp
for themselves that are pernicious to a State

XXXV. Why the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although brought
about by the free and open suffrage of the Citizens, was hurtful to the
liberties of that Republic

XXXVI. That Citizens who have held the higher offices of a Commonwealth
should not disdain the lower

XXXVII. Of the mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and how it is
a great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a law opposed to
ancient usage with stringent retrospective effect

XXXVIII. That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and that the
course they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice

XXXIX. That often the same accidents are seen to befall different
Nations

XL. Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what therein is to
be noted. Wherein among other matters it is shown how the same causes
may lead to the safety or to the ruin of a Commonwealth

XLI. That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to severity, or
to a haughty bearing from a humble

XLII. How easily men become corrupted

XLIII. That men fighting in their own cause make good and resolute
Soldiers

XLIV. That the Multitude is helpless without a head: and that we should
not with the same breath threaten and ask leave

XLV. That it is of evil example, especially in the maker of a law, not
to observe the law when made: and that daily to renew acts of severity
in a City is most hurtful to the Governor

XLVI. That men climb from one step of ambition to another, seeking at
first to escape injury, and then to injure others

XLVII. That though men deceive themselves in generalities, in
particulars they judge truly

XLVIII. He who would not have an office bestowed on some worthless or
wicked person, should contrive that it be solicited by one who is
utterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the highest
degree noble and good

XLIX. That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in freedom,
have had difficulty in framing such laws as would preserve their
freedom, Cities which at the first have been in subjection will find
this almost impossible

L. That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have power to
bring the Government of a City to a stay

LI. What a Prince or Republic does of necessity, should seem to be done
by choice

LII. That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing too
powerful in a State, there is no safer method, nor less open to
objection, than to forestall him in those ways whereby he seeks to
advance himself

LIII. That the People, deceived by a false show of advantage, often
desire what would be their ruin; and that large hopes and brave
promises easily move them

LIV. Of the boundless authority which a great man may use to restrain
an excited Multitude

LV. That the Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the body
of the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible
where equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not

LVI. That when great calamities are about to befall a City or Country,
signs are seen to presage, and seers arise who foretell them

LVII. That the People are strong collectively, but individually weak

LVIII. That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince

LIX. To what Leagues or Alliances we may most trust, whether those we
make with Commonwealths or those we make with Princes

LX. That the Consulship and all the other Magistracies in Rome were
given without respect to Age

BOOK II.

PREFACE


I. Whether the Empire acquired by the Romans was more due to Valour or
to Fortune

II. With what Nations the Romans had to contend, and how stubborn these
were in defending their Freedom

III. That Rome became great by destroying the Cities which lay round
about her, and by readily admitting Strangers to the rights of
Citizenship

IV. That Commonwealths have followed three methods for extending their
power

V. That changes in Sects and Tongues, and the happening of Floods and
Pestilences, obliterate the memory of the past

VI. Of the methods followed by the Romans in making War

VII. Of the quantity of land assigned by the Romans to each colonist

VIII. Why certain Nations leave their ancestral seats and overflow the
Countries of others

IX. Of the Causes which commonly give rise to wars between States

X. That contrary to the vulgar opinion, Money is not the sinews of War

XI. That it were unwise to ally yourself with a Prince who has
reputation rather than strength

XII. Whether when Invasion is imminent it is better to anticipate or to
await it

XIII. That Men rise from humble to high fortunes rather by Fraud than
by Force

XIV. That Men often err in thinking they can subdue Pride by Humility

XV. That weak States are always dubious in their resolves; and that
tardy resolves are always hurtful

XVI. That the Soldiers of our days depart widely from the methods of
ancient Warfare

XVII. What importance the Armies of the present day should allow to
Artillery; and whether the commonly received opinion concerning it be

I send you a gift, which if it answers ill the obligations I owe you,
is at any rate the greatest which Niccolò Machiavelli has it in his
power to offer. For in it I have expressed whatever I have learned, or
have observed for myself during a long experience and constant study of
human affairs. And since neither you nor any other can expect more at
my hands, you cannot complain if I have not given you more.

You may indeed lament the poverty of my wit, since what I have to say
is but poorly said; and tax the weakness of my judgment, which on many
points may have erred in its conclusions. But granting all this, I know
not which of us is less beholden to the other: I to you, who have
forced me to write what of myself I never should have written; or you
to me, who have written what can give you no content.

Take this, however, in the spirit in which all that comes from a friend
should be taken, in respect whereof we always look more to the
intention of the giver than to the quality of the gift. And, believe
me, that in one thing only I find satisfaction, namely, in knowing that
while in many matters I may have made mistakes, at least I have not
been mistaken in choosing you before all others as the persons to whom
I dedicate these Discourses; both because I seem to myself, in doing
so, to have shown a little gratitude for kindness received, and at the
same time to have departed from the hackneyed custom which leads many
authors to inscribe their works to some Prince, and blinded by hopes of
favour or reward, to praise him as possessed of every virtue; whereas
with more reason they might reproach him as contaminated with every
shameful vice.

To avoid which error I have chosen, not those who are but those who
from their infinite merits deserve to be Princes; not such persons as
have it in their power to load me with honours, wealth, and preferment,
but such as though they lack the power, have all the will to do so. For
men, if they would judge justly, should esteem those who are, and not
those whose means enable them to be generous; and in like manner those
who know how to govern kingdoms, rather than those who possess the
government without such knowledge. For Historians award higher praise
to Hiero of Syracuse when in a private station than to Perseus the
Macedonian when a King affirming that while the former lacked nothing
that a Prince should have save the name, the latter had nothing of the
King but the kingdom.

Make the most, therefore, of this good or this evil, as you may esteem
it, which you have brought upon yourselves; and should you persist in
the mistake of thinking my opinions worthy your attention, I shall not
fail to proceed with the rest of the History in the manner promised in
my Preface. _Farewell_.

PREFACE.


Albeit the jealous temper of mankind, ever more disposed to censure
than to praise the work of others, has constantly made the pursuit of
new methods and systems no less perilous than the search after unknown
lands and seas; nevertheless, prompted by that desire which nature has
implanted in me, fearlessly to undertake whatsoever I think offers a
common benefit to all, I enter on a path which, being hitherto
untrodden by any, though it involve me in trouble and fatigue, may yet
win me thanks from those who judge my efforts in a friendly spirit. And
although my feeble discernment, my slender experience of current
affairs, and imperfect knowledge of ancient events, render these
efforts of mine defective and of no great utility, they may at least
open the way to some other, who, with better parts and sounder
reasoning and judgment, shall carry out my design; whereby, if I gain
no credit, at all events I ought to incur no blame.

When I see antiquity held in such reverence, that to omit other
instances, the mere fragment of some ancient statue is often bought at
a great price, in order that the purchaser may keep it by him to adorn
his house, or to have it copied by those who take delight in this art;
and how these, again, strive with all their skill to imitate it in
their various works; and when, on the other hand, I find those noble
labours which history shows to have been wrought on behalf of the
monarchies and republics of old times, by kings, captains, citizens,
lawgivers, and others who have toiled for the good of their country,
rather admired than followed, nay, so absolutely renounced by every one
that not a trace of that antique worth is now left among us, I cannot
but at once marvel and grieve; at this inconsistency; and all the more
because I perceive that, in civil disputes between citizens, and in the
bodily disorders into which men fall, recourse is always had to the
decisions and remedies, pronounced or prescribed by the ancients.

For the civil law is no more than the opinions delivered by the ancient
jurisconsults, which, being reduced to a system, teach the
jurisconsults of our own times how to determine; while the healing art
is simply the recorded experience of the old physicians, on which our
modern physicians found their practice. And yet, in giving laws to a
commonwealth, in maintaining States and governing kingdoms, in
organizing armies and conducting wars, in dealing with subject nations,
and in extending a State’s dominions, we find no prince, no republic,
no captain, and no citizen who resorts to the example of the ancients.

This I persuade myself is due, not so much to the feebleness to which
the present methods of education have brought the world, or to the
injury which a pervading apathy has wrought in many provinces and
cities of Christendom, as to the want of a right intelligence of
History, which renders men incapable in reading it to extract its true
meaning or to relish its flavour. Whence it happens that by far the
greater number of those who read History, take pleasure in following
the variety of incidents which it presents, without a thought to
imitate them; judging such imitation to be not only difficult but
impossible; as though the heavens, the sun, the elements, and man
himself were no longer the same as they formerly were as regards
motion, order, and power.

Desiring to rescue men from this error, I have thought fit to note down
with respect to all those books of Titus Livius which have escaped the
malignity of Time, whatever seems to me essential to a right
understanding of ancient and modern affairs; so that any who shall read
these remarks of mine, may reap from them that profit for the sake of
which a knowledge of History is to be sought. And although the task be
arduous, still, with the help of those at whose instance I assumed the
burthen, I hope to carry it forward so far, that another shall have no
long way to go to bring it to its destination.




CHAPTER I.—_Of the Beginnings of Cities in general, and in particular
of that of Rome._


No one who reads how the city of Rome had its beginning, who were its
founders, and what its ordinances and laws, will marvel that so much
excellence was maintained in it through many ages, or that it grew
afterwards to be so great an Empire.

And, first, as touching its origin, I say, that all cities have been
founded either by the people of the country in which they stand, or by
strangers. Cities have their origins in the former of these two ways
when the inhabitants of a country find that they cannot live securely
if they live dispersed in many and small societies, each of them
unable, whether from its situation or its slender numbers, to stand
alone against the attacks of its enemies; on whose approach there is no
time left to unite for defence without abandoning many strongholds, and
thus becoming an easy prey to the invader. To escape which dangers,
whether of their own motion or at the instance of some of greater
authority among them, they restrict themselves to dwell together in
certain places, which they think will be more convenient to live in and
easier to defend.

Among many cities taking their origin in this way were Athens and
Venice; the former of which, for reasons like those just now mentioned,
was built by a scattered population under the direction of Theseus. To
escape the wars which, on the decay of the Roman Empire daily renewed
in Italy by the arrival of fresh hordes of Barbarians, numerous
refugees, sheltering in certain little islands in a corner of the
Adriatic Sea, gave beginning to Venice; where, without any recognized
leader to direct them, they agreed to live together under such laws as
they thought best suited to maintain them. And by reason of the
prolonged tranquility which their position secured, they being
protected by the narrow sea and by the circumstance that the tribes who
then harassed Italy had no ships wherewith to molest them, they were
able from very small beginnings to attain to that greatness they now
enjoy.

In the second case, namely of a city being founded by strangers, the
settlers are either wholly independent, or they are controlled by
others, as where colonies are sent forth either by a prince or by a
republic, to relieve their countries of an excessive population, or to
defend newly acquired territories which it is sought to secure at small
cost. Of this sort many cities were settled by the Romans, and in all
parts of their dominions. It may also happen that such cities are
founded by a prince merely to add to his renown, without any intention
on his part to dwell there, as Alexandria was built by Alexander the
Great. Cities like these, not having had their beginning in freedom,
seldom make such progress as to rank among the chief towns of kingdoms.

The city of Florence belongs to that class of towns which has not been
independent from the first; for whether we ascribe its origin to the
soldiers of Sylla, or, as some have conjectured, to the mountaineers of
Fiesole (who, emboldened by the long peace which prevailed throughout
the world during the reign of Octavianus, came down to occupy the plain
on the banks of the Arno), in either case, it was founded under the
auspices of Rome nor could, at first, make other progress than was
permitted by the grace of the sovereign State.

The origin of cities may be said to be independent when a people,
either by themselves or under some prince, are constrained by famine,
pestilence, or war to leave their native land and seek a new
habitation. Settlers of this sort either establish themselves in cities
which they find ready to their hand in the countries of which they take
possession, as did Moses; or they build new ones, as did Æneas. It is
in this last case that the merits of a founder and the good fortune of
the city founded are best seen; and this good fortune will be more or
less remarkable according to the greater or less capacity of him who
gives the city its beginning.

The capacity of a founder is known in two ways: by his choice of a
site, or by the laws which he frames. And since men act either of
necessity or from choice, and merit may seem greater where choice is
more restricted, we have to consider whether it may not be well to
choose a sterile district as the site of a new city, in order that the
inhabitants, being constrained to industry, and less corrupted by ease,
may live in closer union, finding less cause for division in the
poverty of their land; as was the case in Ragusa, and in many other
cities built in similar situations. Such a choice were certainly the
wisest and the most advantageous, could men be content to enjoy what is
their own without seeking to lord it over others. But since to be safe
they must be strong, they are compelled avoid these barren districts,
and to plant themselves in more fertile regions; where, the
fruitfulness of the soil enabling them to increase and multiply, they
may defend themselves against any who attack them, and overthrow any
who would withstand their power.

And as for that languor which the situation might breed, care must be
had that hardships which the site does not enforce, shall be enforced
by the laws; and that the example of those wise nations be imitated,
who, inhabiting most fruitful and delightful countries, and such as
were likely to rear a listless and effeminate race, unfit for all manly
exercises, in order to obviate the mischief wrought by the amenity and
relaxing influence of the soil and climate, subjected all who were to
serve as soldiers to the severest training; whence it came that better
soldiers were raised in these countries than in others by nature rugged
and barren. Such, of old, was the kingdom of the Egyptians, which,
though of all lands the most bountiful, yet, by the severe training
which its laws enforced, produced most valiant soldiers, who, had their
names not been lost in antiquity, might be thought to deserve more
praise than Alexander the Great and many besides, whose memory is still
fresh in men’s minds. And even in recent times, any one contemplating
the kingdom of the Soldan, and the military order of the Mamelukes
before they were destroyed by Selim the Grand Turk, must have seen how
carefully they trained their soldiers in every kind of warlike
exercise; showing thereby how much they dreaded that indolence to which
their genial soil and climate might have disposed them, unless
neutralized by strenuous laws. I say, then, that it is a prudent choice
to found your city in a fertile region when the effects of that
fertility are duly balanced by the restraint of the laws.

When Alexander the Great thought to add to his renown by founding a
city, Dinocrates the architect came and showed him how he might build
it on Mount Athos, which not only offered a strong position, but could
be handled that the city built there might present a semblance of the
human form, which would be a thing strange and striking, and worthy of
so great a monarch. But on Alexander asking how the inhabitants were to
live, Dinocrates answered that he had not thought of that. Whereupon,
Alexander laughed, and leaving Mount Athos as it stood, built
Alexandria; where, the fruitfulness of the soil, and the vicinity of
the Nile and the sea, might attract many to take up their abode.

To him, therefore, who inquires into the origin of Rome, if he assign
its beginning to Æneas, it will seem to be of those cities which were
founded by strangers if to Romulus, then of those founded by the
natives of the country. But in whichever class we place it, it will be
seen to have had its beginning in freedom, and not in subjection to
another State. It will be seen, too, as hereafter shall be noted, how
strict was the discipline which the laws instituted by Romulus, Numa,
and its other founders made compulsory upon it; so that neither its
fertility, the proximity of the sea, the number of its victories, nor
the extent of its dominion, could for many centuries corrupt it, but,
on the contrary, maintained it replete with such virtues as were never
matched in any other commonwealth.

And because the things done by Rome, and which Titus Livius has
celebrated, were effected at home or abroad by public or by private
wisdom, I shall begin by treating, and noting the consequences of those
things done at home in accordance with the public voice, which seem
most to merit attention; and to this object the whole of this first
Book or first Part of my Discourses, shall be directed.




CHAPTER II.—Of the various kinds of Government; and to which of them
the Roman Commonwealth belonged.


I forego all discussion concerning those cities which at the outset
have been dependent upon others, and shall speak only of those which
from their earliest beginnings have stood entirely clear of all foreign
control, being governed from the first as pleased themselves, whether
as republics or as princedoms.

These as they have had different origins, so likewise have had
different laws and institutions. For to some at their very first
commencement, or not long after, laws have been given by a single
legislator, and all at one time; like those given by Lycurgus to the
Spartans; while to others they have been given at different times, as
need rose or accident determined; as in the case of Rome. That
republic, indeed, may be called happy, whose lot has been to have a
founder so prudent as to provide for it laws under which it can
continue to live securely, without need to amend them; as we find
Sparta preserving hers for eight hundred years, without deterioration
and without any dangerous disturbance. On the other hand, some measure
of unhappiness attaches to the State which, not having yielded itself
once for all into the hands of a single wise legislator, is obliged to
recast its institutions for itself; and of such States, by far the most
unhappy is that which is furthest removed from a sound system of
government, by which I mean that its institutions lie wholly outside
the path which might lead it to a true and perfect end. For it is
scarcely possible that a State in this position can ever, by any
chance, set itself to rights, whereas another whose institutions are
imperfect, if it have made a good beginning and such as admits of its
amendment, may in the course of events arrive at perfection. It is
certain, however, that such States can never be reformed without great
risk; for, as a rule, men will accept no new law altering the
institutions of their State, unless the necessity for such a change be
demonstrated; and since this necessity cannot arise without danger, the
State may easily be overthrown before the new order of things is
established. In proof whereof we may instance the republic of Florence,
which was reformed in the year 1502, in consequence of the affair of
Arezzo, but was ruined in 1512, in consequence of the affair of Prato.

Desiring, therefore, to discuss the nature of the government of Rome,
and to ascertain the accidental circumstances which brought it to its
perfection, I say, as has been said before by many who have written of
Governments, that of these there are three forms, known by the names
Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and that those who give its
institutions to a State have recourse to one or other of these three,
according as it suits their purpose. Other, and, as many have thought,
wiser teachers, will have it, that there are altogether six forms of
government, three of them utterly bad, the other three good in
themselves, but so readily corrupted that they too are apt to become
hurtful. The good are the three above named; the bad, three others
dependent upon these, and each so like that to which it is related,
that it is easy to pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. For a
Monarchy readily becomes a Tyranny, an Aristocracy an Oligarchy, while
a Democracy tends to degenerate into Anarchy. So that if the founder of
a State should establish any one of these three forms of Government, he
establishes it for a short time only, since no precaution he may take
can prevent it from sliding into its contrary, by reason of the close
resemblance which, in this case, the virtue bears to the vice.

These diversities in the form of Government spring up among men by
chance. For in the beginning of the world, its inhabitants, being few
in number, for a time lived scattered after the fashion of beasts; but
afterwards, as they increased and multiplied, gathered themselves into
societies, and, the better to protect themselves, began to seek who
among them was the strongest and of the highest courage, to whom,
making him their head, they tendered obedience. Next arose the
knowledge of such things as are honourable and good, as opposed to
those which are bad and shameful. For observing that when a man wronged
his benefactor, hatred was universally felt for the one and sympathy
for the other, and that the ungrateful were blamed, while those who
showed gratitude were honoured, and reflecting that the wrongs they saw
done to others might be done to themselves, to escape these they
resorted to making laws and fixing punishments against any who should
transgress them; and in this way grew the recognition of Justice.
Whence it came that afterwards, in choosing their rulers, men no longer
looked about for the strongest, but for him who was the most prudent
and the most just.

But, presently, when sovereignty grew to be hereditary and no longer
elective, hereditary sovereigns began to degenerate from their
ancestors, and, quitting worthy courses, took up the notion that
princes had nothing to do but to surpass the rest of the world in
sumptuous display and wantonness, and whatever else ministers to
pleasure so that the prince coming to be hated, and therefore to feel
fear, and passing from fear to infliction of injuries, a tyranny soon
sprang up. Forthwith there began movements to overthrow the prince, and
plots and conspiracies against him undertaken not by those who were
weak, or afraid for themselves, but by such as being conspicuous for
their birth, courage, wealth, and station, could not tolerate the
shameful life of the tyrant. The multitude, following the lead of these
powerful men, took up arms against the prince and, he being got rid of,
obeyed these others as their liberators; who, on their part, holding in
hatred the name of sole ruler, formed themselves into a government and
at first, while the recollection of past tyranny was still fresh,
observed the laws they themselves made, and postponing personal
advantage to the common welfare, administered affairs both publicly and
privately with the utmost diligence and zeal. But this government
passing, afterwards, to their descendants who, never having been taught
in the school of Adversity, knew nothing of the vicissitudes of
Fortune, these not choosing to rest content with mere civil equality,
but abandoning themselves to avarice, ambition, and lust, converted,
without respect to civil rights what had been a government of the best
into a government of the few; and so very soon met with the same fate
as the tyrant.

For the multitude loathing its rulers, lent itself to any who ventured,
in whatever way, to attack them; when some one man speedily arose who
with the aid of the people overthrew them. But the recollection of the
tyrant and of the wrongs suffered at his hands being still fresh in the
minds of the people, who therefore felt no desire to restore the
monarchy, they had recourse to a popular government, which they
established on such a footing that neither king nor nobles had any
place in it. And because all governments inspire respect at the first,
this government also lasted for a while, but not for long, and seldom
after the generation which brought it into existence had died out. For,
suddenly, liberty passed into license, wherein neither private worth
nor public authority was respected, but, every one living as he liked,
a thousand wrongs were done daily. Whereupon, whether driven by
necessity, or on the suggestion of some wiser man among them and to
escape anarchy, the people reverted to a monarchy, from which, step by
step, in the manner and for the causes already assigned, they came
round once more to license. For this is the circle revolving within
which all States are and have been governed; although in the same State
the same forms of Government rarely repeat themselves, because hardly
any State can have such vitality as to pass through such a cycle more
than once, and still together. For it may be expected that in some sea
of disaster, when a State must always be wanting prudent counsels and
in strength, it will become subject to some neighbouring and
better-governed State; though assuming this not to happen, it might
well pass for an indefinite period from one of these forms of
government to another.

I say, then, that all these six forms of government are pernicious—the
three good kinds, from their brief duration the three bad, from their
inherent badness. Wise legislators therefore, knowing these defects,
and avoiding each of these forms in its simplicity, have made choice of
a form which shares in the qualities of all the first three, and which
they judge to be more stable and lasting than any of these separately.
For where we have a monarchy, an aristocracy, and a democracy existing
together in the same city, each of the three serves as a check upon the
other.

Among those who have earned special praise by devising a constitution
of this nature, was Lycurgus, who so framed the laws of Sparta as to
assign their proper functions to kings, nobles, and commons; and in
this way established a government, which, to his great glory and to the
peace and tranquility of his country, lasted for more than eight
hundred years. The contrary, however, happened in the case of Solon;
who by the turn he gave to the institutions of Athens, created there a
purely democratic government, of such brief duration, that he himself
lived to witness the beginning of the despotism of Pisistratus. And
although, forty years later, the heirs of Pisistratus were driven out,
and Athens recovered her freedom, nevertheless because she reverted to
the same form government as had been established by Solon, she could
maintain it for only a hundred years more; for though to preserve it,
many ordinances were passed for repressing the ambition of the great
and the turbulence of the people, against which Solon had not provided,
still, since neither the monarchic nor the aristocratic element was
given a place in her constitution, Athens, as compared with Sparta, had
but a short life.

But let us now turn to Rome, which city, although she had no Lycurgus
to give her from the first such a constitution as would preserve her
long in freedom, through a series of accidents, caused by the contests
between the commons and the senate, obtained by chance what the
foresight of her founders failed to provide. So that Fortune, if she
bestowed not her first favours on Rome, bestowed her second; because,
although the original institutions of this city were defective, still
they lay not outside the true path which could bring them to
perfection. For Romulus and the other kings made many and good laws,
and such as were not incompatible with freedom; but because they sought
to found a kingdom and not a commonwealth, when the city became free
many things were found wanting which in the interest of liberty it was
necessary to supply, since these kings had not supplied them. And
although the kings of Rome lost their sovereignty, in the manner and
for the causes mentioned above, nevertheless those who drove them out,
by at once creating two consuls to take their place, preserved in Rome
the regal authority while banishing from it the regal throne, so that
as both senate and consuls were included in that republic, it in fact
possessed two of the elements above enumerated, to wit, the monarchic
and the aristocratic.

It then only remained to assign its place to the popular element, and
the Roman nobles growing insolent from causes which shall be noticed
hereafter, the commons against them, when, not to lose the whole of
their power, they were forced to concede a share to the people; while
with the share which remained, the senate and consuls retained so much
authority that they still held their own place in the republic. In this
way the tribunes of the people came to be created, after whose creation
the stability of the State was much augmented, since each the three
forms of government had now its due influence allowed it. And such was
the good fortune of Rome that although her government passed from the
kings to the nobles, and from these to the people, by the steps and for
the reasons noticed above, still the entire authority of the kingly
element was not sacrificed to strengthen the authority of the nobles,
nor were the nobles divested of their authority to bestow it on the
commons; but three, blending together, made up a perfect State; which
perfection, as shall be fully shown in the next two Chapters, was
reached through the dissensions of the commons and the senate.




CHAPTER III.—Of the Accidents which led in Rome to the creation of
Tribunes of the People; whereby the Republic was made more perfect.


They who lay the foundations of a State and furnish it with laws must,
as is shown by all who have treated of civil government, and by
examples of which history is full, assume that ‘all men are bad, and
will always, when they have free field, give loose to their evil
inclinations; and that if these for a while remain hidden, it is owing
to some secret cause, which, from our having no contrary experience, we
do not recognize at once, but which is afterwards revealed by Time, of
whom we speak as the father of all truth.

In Rome, after the expulsion of the Tarquins, it seemed as though the
closest union prevailed between the senate and the commons, and that
the nobles, laying aside their natural arrogance, had learned so to
sympathize with the people as to have become supportable by all, even
of the humblest rank. This dissimulation remained undetected, and its
causes concealed, while the Tarquins lived; for the nobles dreading the
Tarquins, and fearing that the people, if they used them ill, might
take part against them, treated them with kindness. But no sooner were
the Tarquins got rid of, and the nobles thus relieved of their fears,
when they began to spit forth against the commons all the venom which
before they had kept in their breasts, offending and insulting them in
every way they could; confirming what I have observed already, that men
never behave well unless compelled, and that whenever they are free to
act as they please, and are under no restraint everything falls at once
into confusion and disorder. Wherefore it has been said that as poverty
and hunger are needed to make men industrious, so laws are needed to
make them good. When we do well without laws, laws are not needed; but
when good customs are absent, laws are at once required.

On the extinction of the Tarquins, therefore, the dread of whom had
kept the nobles in check, some new safeguard had to be contrived, which
should effect the same result as had been effected by the Tarquins
while they lived. Accordingly, after much uproar and confusion, and
much danger of violence ensuing between the commons and the nobles, to
insure the safety of the former, tribunes were created, and were
invested with such station and authority as always afterwards enabled
them to stand between the people and the senate, and to resist the
insolence of the nobles.




CHAPTER IV.—That the Dissensions between the Senate and Commons of
Rome, made Rome free and powerful.


Touching those tumults which prevailed in Rome from the extinction of
the Tarquins to the creation of the tribunes the discussion of which I
have no wish to avoid, and as to certain other matters of a like
nature, I desire to say something in opposition to the opinion of many
who assert that Rome was a turbulent city, and had fallen into utter
disorder, that had not her good fortune and military prowess made
amends for other defects, she would have been inferior to every other
republic.

I cannot indeed deny that the good fortune and the armies of Rome were
the causes of her empire; yet it certainly seems to me that those
holding this opinion fail to perceive, that in a State where there are
good soldiers there must be good order, and, generally speaking, good
fortune. And looking to the other circumstances of this city, I affirm
that those who condemn these dissensions between the nobles and the
commons, condemn what was the prime cause of Rome becoming free; and
give more heed to the tumult and uproar wherewith these dissensions
were attended, than to the good results which followed from them; not
reflecting that while in every republic there are two conflicting
factions, that of the people and that of the nobles, it is in this
conflict that all laws favourable to freedom have their origin, as may
readily be seen to have been the case in Rome. For from the time of the
Tarquins to that of the Gracchi, a period of over three hundred years,
the tumults in Rome seldom gave occasion to punishment by exile, and
very seldom to bloodshed. So that we cannot truly declare those tumults
to have been disastrous, or that republic to have been disorderly,
which during all that time, on account of her internal broils, banished
no more than eight or ten of her citizens, put very few to death, and
rarely inflicted money penalties. Nor can we reasonably pronounce that
city ill-governed wherein we find so many instances of virtue; for
virtuous actions have their origin in right training, right training in
wise laws, and wise laws in these very tumults which many would
thoughtlessly condemn. For he who looks well to the results of these
tumults will find that they did not lead to banishments, nor to
violence hurtful to the common good, but to laws and ordinances
beneficial to the public liberty. And should any object that the
behaviour of the Romans was extravagant and outrageous; that for the
assembled people to be heard shouting against the senate, the senate
against the people; for the whole commons to be seen rushing wildly
through the streets, closing their shops, and quitting the town, were
things which might well affright him even who only reads of them; it
may be answered, that the inhabitants of all cities, more especially of
cities which seek to make use of the people in matters of importance,
have their own ways of giving expression to their wishes; among which
the city of Rome had the custom, that when its people sought to have a
law passed they followed one or another of those courses mentioned
above, or else refused to be enrolled as soldiers when, to pacify them,
something of their demands had to be conceded. But the demands of a
free people are hurtful to freedom, since they originate either in
being oppressed, or in the fear that they are about to be so. When this
fear is groundless, it finds its remedy in public meetings, wherein
some worthy person may come forward and show the people by argument
that they are deceiving themselves. For though they be ignorant, the
people are not therefore, as Cicero says, incapable of being taught the
truth, but are readily convinced when it is told them by one in whose
honesty they can trust.

We should, therefore, be careful how we censure the government of Rome,
and should reflect that all the great results effected by that
republic, could not have come about without good cause. And if the
popular tumults led the creation of the tribunes, they merit all
praise; since these magistrates not only gave its due influence to the
popular voice in the government, but also acted as the guardians of
Roman freedom, as shall be clearly shown in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER V.—_Whether the Guardianship of public Freedom is safer in the
hands of the Commons or of the Nobles; and whether those who seek to
acquire Power or they who seek to maintain it are the greater cause of
Commotions._


Of the provisions made by wise founders of republics, one of the most
necessary is for the creation of a guardianship of liberty; for
according as this is placed in good or bad hands, the freedom of the
State will be more or less lasting. And because in every republic we
find the two parties of nobles and commons, the question arises, to
which of these two this guardianship can most safely be entrusted.
Among the Lacedæmonians of old, as now with the Venetians, it was
placed in the hands of the nobles, but with the Romans it was vested in
the commons. We have, therefore, to determine which of these States
made the wiser choice. If we look to reasons, something is to be said
on both sides of the question; though were we to look to results, we
should have to pronounce in favour of the nobles, inasmuch as the
liberty of Sparta and Venice has had a longer life than that of Rome.

As touching reasons, it may be pleaded for the Roman method, that they
are most fit to have charge of a thing, who least desire to pervert it
to their own ends. And, doubtless, if we examine the aims which the
nobles and the commons respectively set before them, we shall find in
the former a great desire to dominate, in the latter merely a desire
not to be dominated over, and hence a greater attachment to freedom,
since they have less to gain than the others by destroying it.
Wherefore, when the commons are put forward as the defenders of
liberty, they may be expected to take better care of it, and, as they
have no desire to tamper with it themselves, to be less apt to suffer
others to do so.

On the other hand, he who defends the method followed by the Spartans
and Venetians, may urge, that by confiding this guardianship to the
nobles, two desirable ends are served: first, that from being allowed
to retain in their own hands a weapon which makes them the stronger
party in the State, the ambition of this class is more fully satisfied;
and, second, that an authority is withdrawn from the unstable multitude
which as used by them is likely to lead to endless disputes and
tumults, and to drive the nobles into dangerous and desperate courses.
In instance whereof might be cited the case of Rome itself, wherein the
tribunes of the people being vested with this authority, not content to
have one consul a plebeian, insisted on having both; and afterwards
laid claim to the censorship, the prætorship and all the other
magistracies in the city. Nor was this enough for them, but, carried
away by the same factious spirit, they began after a time to pay court
to such men as they thought able to attack the nobility, and so gave
occasion to the rise of Marius and the overthrow of Rome.

Wherefore one who weighs both sides of the question well, might
hesitate which party he should choose as the guardian of public
liberty, being uncertain which class is more mischievous in a
commonwealth, that which would acquire what it has not, or that which
would keep the authority which it has already. But, on the whole, on a
careful balance of arguments we may sum up thus:—Either we have to deal
with a republic eager like Rome to extend its power, or with one
content merely to maintain itself; in the former case it is necessary
to do in all things as Rome did; in the latter, for the reasons and in
the manner to be shown in the following Chapter, we may imitate Venice
and Sparta.

But reverting to the question which class of citizens is more
mischievous in a republic, those who seek to acquire or those who fear
to lose what they have acquired already, I note that when Marcus
Menenius and Marcus Fulvius, both of them men of plebeian birth, were
made the one dictator, the other master of the knights, that they might
inquire into certain plots against Rome contrived in Capua, they had at
the same time authority given them by the people to investigate
whether, in Rome itself, irregular and corrupt practices had been used
to obtain the consulship and other honours of the city. The nobles
suspecting that the powers thus conferred were to be turned against
them, everywhere gave out that if honours had been sought by any by
irregular and unworthy means, it was not by them, but by the plebeians,
who, with neither birth nor merit to recommend them, had need to resort
to corruption. And more particularly they accused the dictator himself.
And so telling was the effect of these charges, that Menenius, after
haranguing the people and complaining to them of the calumnies
circulated against him, laid down his dictatorship, and submitted
himself to whatever judgment might be passed upon him. When his cause
came to be tried he was acquitted; but at the hearing it was much
debated, whether he who would retain power or he who would acquire it,
is the more dangerous citizen; the desires of both being likely to lead
to the greatest disorders.

Nevertheless, I believe that, as a rule, disorders are more commonly
occasioned by those seeking to preserve power, because in them the fear
of loss breeds the same passions as are felt by those seeking to
acquire; since men never think they hold what they have securely,
unless when they are gaining something new from others. It is also to
be said that their position enables them to operate changes with less
effort and greater efficacy. Further, it may be added, that their
corrupt and insolent behaviour inflames the minds of those who have
nothing, with the desire to have; either for the sake of punishing
their adversaries by despoiling them, or to obtain for themselves a
share of those riches and honours which they see the others abuse.




CHAPTER VI.—_Whether it was possible in Rome to contrive such a
Government as would have composed the Differences between the Commons
and the Senate._


I have spoken above of the effects produced in Rome by the
controversies between the commons and the senate. Now, as these lasted
down to the time of the Gracchi, when they brought about the overthrow
of freedom, some may think it matter for regret that Rome should not
have achieved the great things she did, without being torn by such
disputes. Wherefore, it seems to me worth while to consider whether the
government of Rome could ever have been constituted in such a way as to
prevent like controversies.

In making this inquiry we must first look to those republics which have
enjoyed freedom for a great while, undisturbed by any violent
contentions or tumults, and see what their government was, and whether
it would have been possible to introduce it into Rome. Of such
republics we have an example in ancient times in Sparta, in modern
times in Venice, of both which States I have already made mention.
Sparta created for herself a government consisting of a king and a
limited senate. Venice has made no distinction in the titles of her
rulers, all qualified to take part in her government being classed
under the one designation of “Gentlemen,” an arrangement due rather to
chance than to the foresight of those who gave this State its
constitution. For many persons, from causes already noticed, seeking
shelter on these rocks on which Venice now stands, after they had so
multiplied that if they were to continue to live together it became
necessary for them to frame laws, established a form of government; and
assembling often in their councils to consult for the interests of
their city, when it seemed to them that their numbers were sufficient
for political existence, they closed the entrance to civil rights
against all who came afterwards to live there, not allowing them to
take any part in the management of affairs. And when in course of time
there came to be many citizens excluded from the government, to add to
the importance of the governing body, they named these “Gentlemen”
(_gentiluomini_), the others “Plebeians” (_popolani_). And this
distinction could grow up and maintain itself without causing
disturbance; for as at the time of its origin, whosoever then lived in
Venice was made one of the governing body, none had reason to complain;
while those who came to live there afterwards, finding the government
in a completed form, had neither ground nor opportunity to object. No
ground, because nothing was taken from them; and no opportunity,
because those in authority kept them under control, and never employed
them in affairs in which they could acquire importance. Besides which,
they who came later to dwell in Venice were not so numerous as to
destroy all proportion between the governors and the governed; the
number of the “Gentlemen” being as great as, or greater than that of
the “Plebeians.” For these reasons, therefore, it was possible for
Venice to make her constitution what it is, and to maintain it without
divisions.

Sparta, again, being governed, as I have said, by a king and a limited
senate, was able to maintain herself for the long period she did,
because, from the country being thinly inhabited and further influx of
population forbidden, and from the laws of Lycurgus (the observance
whereof removed all ground of disturbance) being held in high esteem,
the citizens were able to continue long in unity. For Lycurgus having
by his laws established in Sparta great equality as to property, but
less equality as to rank, there prevailed there an equal poverty; and
the commons were less ambitious, because the offices of the State,
which were held to their exclusion, were confined to a few; and because
the nobles never by harsh treatment aroused in them any desire to usurp
these offices. And this was due to the Spartan kings, who, being
appointed to that dignity for life, and placed in the midst of this
nobility, had no stronger support to their authority than in defending
the people against injustice. Whence it resulted that as the people
neither feared nor coveted the power which they did not possess, the
conflicts which might have arisen between them and the nobles were
escaped, together with the causes which would have led to them; and in
this way they were able to live long united. But of this unity in
Sparta there were two chief causes: one, the fewness of its
inhabitants, which allowed of their being governed by a few; the other,
that by denying foreigners admission into their country, the people had
less occasion to become corrupted, and never so increased in numbers as
to prove troublesome to their few rulers.

Weighing all which circumstances, we see that to have kept Rome in the
same tranquility wherein these republics were kept, one of two courses
must have been followed by her legislators; for either, like the
Venetians, they must have refrained from employing the commons in war,
or else, like the Spartans, they must have closed their country to
foreigners. Whereas, in both particulars, they did the opposite, arming
the commons and increasing their number, and thus affording endless
occasions for disorder. And had the Roman commonwealth grown to be more
tranquil, this inconvenience would have resulted, that it must at the
same time have grown weaker, since the road would have been closed to
that greatness to which it came, for in removing the causes of her
tumults, Rome must have interfered with the causes of her growth.

And he who looks carefully into the matter will find, that in all human
affairs, we cannot rid ourselves of one inconvenience without running
into another. So that if you would have your people numerous and
warlike, to the end that with their aid you may establish a great
empire, you will have them of such a sort as you cannot afterwards
control at your pleasure; while should you keep them few and unwarlike,
to the end that you may govern them easily, you will be unable, should
you extend your dominions, to preserve them, and will become so
contemptible as to be the prey of any who attack you. For which reason
in all our deliberations we ought to consider where we are likely to
encounter least inconvenience, and accept that as the course to be
preferred, since we shall never find any line of action entirely free
from disadvantage.

Rome might, therefore, following the example of Sparta, have created a
king for life and a senate of limited numbers, but desiring to become a
great empire, she could not, like Sparta, have restricted the number of
her citizens. So that to have created a king for life and a limited
senate had been of little service to her.

Were any one, therefore, about to found a wholly new republic, he would
have to consider whether he desired it to increase as Rome did in
territory and dominion, or to continue within narrow limits. In the
former case he would have to shape its constitution as nearly as
possible on the pattern of the Roman, leaving room for dissensions and
popular tumults, for without a great and warlike population no republic
can ever increase, or increasing maintain itself. In the second case he
might give his republic a constitution like that of Venice or Sparta;
but since extension is the ruin of such republics, the legislator would
have to provide in every possible way against the State which he had
founded making any additions to its territories. For these, when
superimposed upon a feeble republic, are sure to be fatal to it: as we
see to have been the case with Sparta and Venice, the former of which,
after subjugating nearly all Greece, on sustaining a trifling reverse,
betrayed the insufficiency of her foundations, for when, after the
revolt of Thebes under Pelopidas, other cities also rebelled, the
Spartan kingdom was utterly overthrown. Venice in like manner, after
gaining possession of a great portion of Italy (most of it not by her
arms but by her wealth and subtlety), when her strength was put to the
proof, lost all in one pitched battle.

I can well believe, then, that to found a republic which shall long
endure, the best plan may be to give it internal institutions like
those of Sparta or Venice; placing it in a naturally strong situation,
and so fortifying it that none can expect to get the better of it
easily, yet, at the same time, not making it so great as to be
formidable to its neighbours; since by taking these precautions, it
might long enjoy its independence. For there are two causes which lead
to wars being made against a republic; one, your desire to be its
master, the other the fear lest it should master you; both of which
dangers the precaution indicated will go far to remove. For if, as we
are to assume, this republic be well prepared for defence, and
consequently difficult of attack, it will seldom or never happen that
any one will form the design to attack it, and while it keeps within
its own boundaries, and is seen from experience not to be influenced by
ambition, no one will be led, out of fear for himself, to make war upon
it, more particularly when its laws and constitution forbid its
extension. And were it possible to maintain things in this equilibrium,
I veritably believe that herein would be found the true form of
political life, and the true tranquility of a republic. But all human
affairs being in movement, and incapable of remaining as they are, they
must either rise or fall; and to many conclusions to which we are not
led by reason, we are brought by necessity. So that when we have given
institutions to a State on the footing that it is to maintain itself
without enlargement, should necessity require its enlargement, its
foundations will be cut from below it, and its downfall quickly ensue.
On the other hand, were a republic so favoured by Heaven as to lie
under no necessity of making war, the result of this ease would be to
make it effeminate and divided which two evils together, and each by
itself, would insure its ruin. And since it is impossible, as I
believe, to bring about an equilibrium, or to adhere strictly to the
mean path, we must, in arranging our republic, consider what is the
more honourable course for it to take, and so contrive that even if
necessity compel its enlargement, it may be able to keep what it gains.

But returning to the point first raised, I believe it necessary for us
to follow the method of the Romans and not that of the other republics,
for I know of no middle way. We must, consequently, put up with those
dissensions which arise between commons and senate, looking on them as
evils which cannot be escaped if we would arrive at the greatness of
Rome.

In connection with the arguments here used to prove that the authority
of the tribunes was essential in Rome to the guardianship of freedom,
we may naturally go on to show what advantages result to a republic
from the power of impeachment; which, together with others, was
conferred upon the tribunes; a subject to be noticed in the following
Chapter.




CHAPTER VII.—_That to preserve Liberty in a State there must exist the
Right to accuse._


To those set forward in a commonwealth as guardians of public freedom,
no more useful or necessary authority can be given than the power to
accuse, either before the people, or before some council or tribunal,
those citizens who in any way have offended against the liberty of
their country.

A law of this kind has two effects most beneficial to a State: _first,_
that the citizens from fear of being accused, do not engage in attempts
hurtful to the State, or doing so, are put down at once and without
respect of persons: and _next,_ that a vent is given for the escape of
all those evil humours which, from whatever cause, gather in cities
against particular citizens; for unless an outlet be duly provided for
these by the laws, they flow into irregular channels and overwhelm the
State. There is nothing, therefore, which contributes so much to the
stability and permanence of a State, as to take care that the
fermentation of these disturbing humours be supplied by operation of
law with a recognized outlet. This might be shown by many examples, but
by none so clearly as by that of Coriolanus related by Livius, where he
tells us, that at a time when the Roman nobles were angry with the
plebeians (thinking that the appointment of tribunes for their
protection had made them too powerful), it happened that Rome was
visited by a grievous famine, to meet which the senate sent to Sicily
for corn. But Coriolanus, hating the commons, sought to persuade the
senate that now was the time to punish them, and to deprive them of the
authority which they had usurped to the prejudice of the nobles, by
withholding the distribution of corn, and so suffering them to perish
of hunger. Which advice of his coming to the ears of the people,
kindled them to such fury against him, that they would have slain him
as he left the Senate House, had not the tribunes cited him to appear
and answer before them to a formal charge.

In respect of this incident I repeat what I have just now said, how
useful and necessary it is for republics to provide by their laws a
channel by which the displeasure of the multitude against a single
citizen may find a vent. For when none such is regularly provided,
recourse will be had to irregular channels, and these will assuredly
lead to much worse results. For when a citizen is borne down by the
operation of the ordinary laws, even though he be wronged, little or no
disturbance is occasioned to the state: the injury he suffers not being
wrought by private violence, nor by foreign force, which are the causes
of the overthrow of free institutions, but by public authority and in
accordance with public ordinances, which, having definite limits set
them, are not likely to pass beyond these so as to endanger the
commonwealth. For proof of which I am content to rest on this old
example of Coriolanus, since all may see what a disaster it would have
been for Rome had he been violently put to death by the people. For, as
between citizen and citizen, a wrong would have been done affording
ground for fear, fear would have sought defence, defence have led to
faction, faction to divisions in the State, and these to its ruin. But
the matter being taken up by those whose office it was to deal with it,
all the evils which must have followed had it been left in private
hands were escaped.

In Florence, on the other hand, and in our own days, we have seen what
violent commotions follow when the people cannot show their displeasure
against particular citizens in a form recognized by the laws, in the
instance of Francesco Valori, at one time looked upon as the foremost
citizen of our republic. But many thinking him ambitious, and likely
from his high spirit and daring to overstep the limits of civil
freedom, and there being no way to oppose him save by setting up an
adverse faction, the result was, that, apprehending irregular attacks,
he sought to gain partisans for his support; while his opponents, on
their side, having no course open to them of which the laws approved,
resorted to courses of which the laws did not approve, and, at last, to
open violence. And as his influence had to be attacked by unlawful
methods, these were attended by injury not to him only, but to many
other noble citizens; whereas, could he have been met by constitutional
restraints, his power might have been broken without injury to any save
himself. I might also cite from our Florentine history the fall of
Piero Soderini, which had no other cause than there not being in our
republic any law under which powerful and ambitious citizens can be
impeached. For to form a tribunal by which a powerful citizen is to be
tried, eight judges only are not enough; the judges must be numerous,
because a few will always do the will of a few. But had there been
proper methods for obtaining redress, either the people would have
impeached Piero if he was guilty, and thus have given vent to their
displeasure without calling in the Spanish army; or if he was innocent,
would not have ventured, through fear of being accused themselves, to
have taken proceedings against him. So that in either case the bitter
spirit which was the cause of all the disorder would have had an end.
Wherefore, when we find one of the parties in a State calling in a
foreign power, we may safely conclude that it is because the defective
laws of that State provide no escape for those malignant humours which
are natural to men; which can best be done by arranging for an
impeachment before a sufficient number of judges, and by giving
countenance to this procedure. This was so well contrived in Rome that
in spite of the perpetual struggle maintained between the commons and
the senate, neither the senate nor the commons, nor any single citizen,
ever sought redress at the hands of a foreign power; for having a
remedy at home, there was no need to seek one abroad.

Although the examples above cited be proof sufficient of what I affirm,
I desire to adduce one other, recorded by Titus Livius in his history,
where he relates that a sister of Aruns having been violated by a
Lucumo of Clusium, the chief of the Etruscan towns, Aruns being unable,
from the interest of her ravisher, to avenge her, betook himself to the
Gauls who ruled in the province we now name Lombardy, and besought them
to come with an armed force to Clusium; showing them how with advantage
to themselves they might avenge his wrongs. Now, had Aruns seen that he
could have had redress through the laws of his country, he never would
have resorted to these Barbarians for help.

But as the right to accuse is beneficial in a republic, so calumny, on
the other hand, is useless and hurtful, as in the following Chapter I
shall proceed to show.




CHAPTER VIII.—_That Calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the
power to accuse is useful._


Such were the services rendered to Rome by Furius Camillus in rescuing
her from the oppression of the Gauls, that no Roman, however high his
degree or station, held it derogatory to yield place to him, save only
Manlius Capitolinus, who could not brook such glory and distinction
being given to another. For he thought that in saving the Capitol, he
had himself done as much as Camillus to preserve Rome, and that in
respect of his other warlike achievements he was no whit behind him. So
that, bursting with jealousy, and unable to remain at rest by reason of
the other’s renown, and seeing no way to sow discord among the Fathers,
he set himself to spread abroad sinister reports among the commons;
throwing out, among other charges, that the treasure collected to be
given to the Gauls, but which, afterwards, was withheld, had been
embezzled by certain citizens, and if recovered might be turned to
public uses in relieving the people from taxes or from private debts.
These assertions so prevailed with the commons that they began to hold
meetings and to raise what tumults they liked throughout the city. But
this displeasing the senate, and the matter appearing to them grave and
dangerous, they appointed a dictator to inquire into it, and to
restrain the attacks of Manlius. The dictator, forthwith, caused
Manlius to be cited before him; and these two were thus brought face to
face in the presence of the whole city, the dictator surrounded by the
nobles, and Manlius by the commons. The latter, being desired to say
with whom the treasure of which he had spoken was to be found, since
the senate were as anxious to know this as the commons, made no direct
reply, but answered evasively that it was needless to tell them what
they already knew. Whereupon the dictator ordered him to prison.

In this passage we are taught how hateful a thing is calumny in all
free States, as, indeed, in every society, and how we must neglect no
means which may serve to check it. And there can be no more effectual
means for checking calumny than by affording ample facilities for
impeachment, which is as useful in a commonwealth as the other is
pernicious. And between them there is this difference, that calumny
needs neither witness, nor circumstantial proof to establish it, so
that any man may be calumniated by any other; but not impeached; since
impeachment demands that there be substantive charges made, and
trustworthy evidence to support them. Again, it is before the
magistrates, the people, or the courts of justice that men are
impeached; but in the streets and market places that they are
calumniated. Calumny, therefore, is most rife in that State wherein
impeachment is least practised, and the laws least favour it. For which
reasons the legislator should so shape the laws of his State that it
shall be possible therein to impeach any of its citizens without fear
or favour; and, after duly providing for this, should visit
calumniators with the sharpest punishments. Those punished will have no
cause to complain, since it was in their power to have impeached openly
where they have secretly calumniated. Where this is not seen to, grave
disorders will always ensue. For calumnies sting without disabling; and
those who are stung being more moved by hatred of their detractors than
by fear of the things they say against them, seek revenge.

This matter, as we have said, was well arranged for in Rome, but has
always been badly regulated in our city of Florence. And as the Roman
ordinances with regard to it were productive of much good, so the want
of them in Florence has bred much mischief. For any one reading the
history of our city may perceive, how many calumnies have at all times
been aimed against those of its citizens who have taken a leading part
in its affairs. Thus, of one it would be said that he had plundered the
public treasury, of another, that he had failed in some enterprise
because he had been bribed; of a third, that this or the other disaster
had originated in his ambition. Hence hatred sprung up on every side,
and hatred growing to division, these led to factions, and these again
to ruin. But had there existed in Florence some procedure whereby
citizens might have been impeached, and calumniators punished,
numberless disorders which have taken there would have been prevented.
For citizens who were impeached, whether condemned or acquitted, would
have had no power to injure the State; and they would have been
impeached far seldomer than they have been calumniated; for calumny, as
I have said already, is an easier matter than impeachment.

Some, indeed, have made use of calumny as a means for raising
themselves to power, and have found their advantage in traducing
eminent citizens who withstood their designs; for by taking the part of
the people, and confirming them in their ill-opinion of these great
men, they made them their friends. Of this, though I could give many
instances, I shall content myself with one. At the siege of Lucca the
Florentine army was commanded by Messer Giovanni Guicciardini, as its
commissary, through whose bad generalship or ill-fortune the town was
not taken. But whatever the cause of this failure, Messer Giovanni had
the blame; and the rumour ran that he had been bribed by the people of
Lucca. Which calumny being fostered by his enemies, brought Messer
Giovanni to very verge of despair; and though to clear himself he would
willingly have given himself up to the Captain of Justice he found he
could not, there being no provision in the laws of the republic which
allowed of his doing so. Hence arose the bitterest hostility between
the friends of Messer Giovanni, who were mostly of the old nobility
(_grandi_), and those who sought to reform the government of Florence;
and from this and the like causes, the affair grew to such dimensions
as to bring about the downfall of our republic.

Manlius Capitolinus, then, was a calumniator, not an accuser; and in
their treatment of him the Romans showed how calumniators should be
dealt with; by which I mean, that they should be forced to become
accusers; and if their accusation be proved true, should be rewarded,
or at least not punished, but if proved false should be punished as
Manlius was.




CHAPTER IX.—_That to give new Institutions to a Commonwealth, or to
reconstruct old Institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work
of one Man_.


It may perhaps be thought that I should not have got so far into the
history of Rome, without some mention of those who gave that city its
institutions, and saying something of these institutions themselves, so
far as they relate to religion and war. As I have no wish to keep those
who would know my views on these matters in suspense, I say at once,
that to many it might seem of evil omen that the founder of a civil
government like Romulus, should first have slain his brother, and
afterwards have consented to the death of Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom
he had chosen to be his colleague in the kingship; since his
countrymen, if moved by ambition and lust of power to inflict like
injuries on any who opposed their designs, might plead the example of
their prince. This view would be a reasonable one were we to disregard
the object which led Romulus to put those men to death. But we must
take it as a rule to which there are very few if any exceptions, that
no commonwealth or kingdom ever has salutary institutions given it from
the first or has its institutions recast in an entirely new mould,
unless by a single person. On the contrary, it must be from one man
that it receives its institutions at first, and upon one man that all
similar reconstruction must depend. For this reason the wise founder of
a commonwealth who seeks to benefit not himself only, or the line of
his descendants, but his State and country, must endeavour to acquire
an absolute and undivided authority. And none who is wise will ever
blame any action, however extraordinary and irregular, which serves to
lay the foundation of a kingdom or to establish a republic. For
although the act condemn the doer, the end may justify him; and when,
as in the case of Romulus, the end is good, it will always excuse the
means; since it is he who does violence with intent to injure, not he
who does it with the design to secure tranquility, who merits blame.
Such a person ought however to be so prudent and moderate as to avoid
transmitting the absolute authority he acquires, as an inheritance to
another; for as men are, by nature, more prone to evil than to good, a
successor may turn to ambitious ends the power which his predecessor
has used to promote worthy ends. Moreover, though it be one man that
must give a State its institutions, once given they are not so likely
to last long resting for support on the shoulders of one man only, as
when entrusted to the care of many, and when it is the business of many
to maintain them. For though the multitude be unfit to set a State in
order, since they cannot, by reason of the divisions which prevail
among them, agree wherein the true well-being of the State lies, yet
when they have once been taught the truth, they never will consent to
abandon it. And that Romulus, though he put his brother to death, is
yet of those who are to be pardoned, since what he did was done for the
common good and not from personal ambition, is shown by his at once
creating a senate, with whom he took counsel, and in accordance with
whose voice he determined. And whosoever shall well examine the
authority which Romulus reserved to himself, will find that he reserved
nothing beyond the command of the army when war was resolved on, and
the right to assemble the senate. This is seen later, on Rome becoming
free by the expulsion of the Tarquins, when the Romans altered none of
their ancient institutions save in appointing two consuls for a year
instead of a king for life; for this proves that all the original
institutions of that city were more in conformity with a free and
constitutional government, than with an absolute and despotic one.

In support of what has been said above, I might cite innumerable
instances, as of Moses, Lycurgus, Solon, and other founders of kingdoms
and commonwealths, who, from the full powers given them, were enabled
to shape their laws to the public advantage; but passing over these
examples, as of common notoriety, I take one, not indeed so famous, but
which merits the attention of all who desire to frame wise laws. Agis,
King of Sparta, desiring to bring back his countrymen to those limits
within which the laws of Lycurgus had held them, because he thought
that, from having somewhat deviated from them, his city had lost much
of its ancient virtue and, consequently much of its strength and power,
was, at the very outset of his attempts, slain by the Spartan Ephori,
as one who sought to make himself a tyrant. But Cleomenes coming after
him in the kingdom, and, on reading the notes and writings which he
found of Agis wherein his designs and intentions were explained, being
stirred by the same desire, perceived that he could not confer this
benefit on his country unless he obtained sole power. For he saw that
the ambition of others made it impossible for him to do what was useful
for many against the will of a few. Wherefore, finding fit occasion, he
caused the Ephori and all others likely to throw obstacles in his way,
to be put to death; after which, he completely renewed the laws of
Lycurgus. And the result of his measures would have been to give fresh
life to Sparta, and to gain for himself a renown not inferior to that
of Lycurgus, had it not been for the power of the Macedonians and the
weakness of the other Greek States. For while engaged with these
reforms, he was attacked by the Macedonians, and being by himself no
match for them, and having none to whom he could turn for help, he was
overpowered; and his plans, though wise and praiseworthy, were never
brought to perfection.

All which circumstances considered, I conclude that he who gives new
institutions to a State must stand alone; and that for the deaths of
Remus and Tatius, Romulus is to be excused rather than blamed.




CHAPTER X.—_That in proportion as the Founder of a Kingdom or
Commonwealth merits Praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves Blame._


Of all who are praised they are praised the most, who are the authors
and founders of religions. After whom come the founders of kingdoms and
commonwealths. Next to these, they have the greatest name who as
commanders of armies have added to their own dominions or those of
their country. After these, again, are ranked men of letters, who being
of various shades of merit are celebrated each in his degree. To all
others, whose number is infinite, is ascribed that measure of praise to
which his profession or occupation entitles him. And, conversely, all
who contribute to the overthrow of religion, or to the ruin of kingdoms
and commonwealths, all who are foes to letters and to the arts which
confer honour and benefit on the human race (among whom I reckon the
impious, the cruel, the ignorant, the indolent, the base and the
worthless), are held in infamy and detestation.

No one, whether he be wise or foolish, bad or good, if asked to choose
between these two kinds of men, will ever be found to withhold praise
from what deserves praise, or blame from what is to be blamed. And yet
almost all, deceived by a false good and a false glory, allow
themselves either ignorantly or wilfully to follow in the footsteps
such as deserve blame rather than praise; and, have it in their power
to establish, to their lasting renown, a commonwealth or kingdom, turn
aside to create a tyranny without a thought how much they thereby lose
in name, fame, security, tranquility, and peace of mind; and into how
much infamy, scorn, danger, and disquiet they run. But were they to
read history, and turn to profit the lessons of the past, it seems
impossible that those living in a republic as private citizens, should
not prefer, in their native city, to play the part of Scipio rather of
Cæsar; or that those who by good fortune or merit have risen to be
rulers, should not seek rather to resemble Agesilaus, Timoleon, and
Dion, than to Nabis, Phalaris and Dionysius; since they would see how
the latter are loaded with infamy, while the former have been extolled
beyond bounds. They would see, too, how Timoleon and others like him,
had as great authority in their country as Dionysius or Phalaris in
theirs, while enjoying far greater security. Nor let any one finding
Cæsar celebrated by a crowd of writers, be misled by his glory; for
those who praise him have been corrupted by his good fortune, and
overawed by the greatness of that empire which, being governed in his
name, would not suffer any to speak their minds openly concerning him.
But let him who desires to know how historians would have written of
Cæsar had they been free to declare their thoughts mark what they say
of Catiline, than whom Cæsar is more hateful, in proportion as he who
does is more to be condemned than he who only desires to do evil. Let
him see also what praises they lavish upon Brutus, because being
unable, out of respect for his power, to reproach Cæsar, they magnify
his enemy. And if he who has become prince in any State will but
reflect, how, after Rome was made an empire, far greater praise was
earned those emperors who lived within the laws, and worthily, than by
those who lived in the contrary way, he will see that Titus, Nerva,
Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus and Marcus had no need of prætorian cohorts,
or of countless legions to guard them, but were defended by their own
good lives, the good-will of their subjects, and the attachment of the
senate. In like manner he will perceive in the case of Caligula, Nero,
Vitellius, and ever so many more of those evil emperors, that all the
armies of the east and of the west were of no avail to protect them
from the enemies whom their bad and depraved lives raised up against
them. And were the history of these emperors rightly studied, it would
be a sufficient lesson to any prince how to distinguish the paths which
lead to honour and safety from those which end in shame and insecurity.
For of the twenty-six emperors from Cæsar to Maximinus, sixteen came to
a violent, ten only to a natural death; and though one or two of those
who died by violence may have been good princes, as Galba or Pertinax,
they met their fate in consequence of that corruption which their
predecessors had left behind in the army. And if among those who died a
natural death, there be found some bad emperors, like Severus, it is to
be ascribed to their signal good fortune and to their great abilities,
advantages seldom found united in the same man. From the study of this
history we may also learn how a good government is to be established;
for while all the emperors who succeeded to the throne by birth, except
Titus, were bad, all were good who succeeded by adoption; as in the
case of the five from Nerva to Marcus. But so soon as the empire fell
once more to the heirs by birth, its ruin recommenced.

Let a prince therefore look to that period which extends from Nerva to
Marcus, and contrast it with that which went before and that which came
after, and then let him say in which of them he would wish to have been
born or to have reigned. For during these times in which good men
governed, he will see the prince secure in the midst of happy subjects,
and the whole world filled with peace and justice. He will find the
senate maintaining its authority, the magistrates enjoying their
honours, rich citizens their wealth, rank and merit held in respect,
ease and content everywhere prevailing, rancour, licence, corruption
and ambition everywhere quenched, and that golden age restored in which
every one might hold and support what opinions he pleased. He will see,
in short, the world triumphing, the sovereign honoured and revered, the
people animated with love, and rejoicing in their security. But should
he turn to examine the times of the other emperors, he will find them
wasted by battles, torn by seditions, cruel alike in war and peace;
many princes perishing by the sword; many wars foreign and domestic;
Italy overwhelmed with unheard-of disasters; her towns destroyed and
plundered; Rome burned; the Capitol razed to the ground by Roman
citizens; the ancient temples desolated; the ceremonies of religion
corrupted; the cities rank with adultery; the seas covered with exiles
and the islands polluted with blood. He will see outrage follow
outrage; rank, riches, honours, and, above all, virtue imputed as
mortal crimes; informers rewarded; slaves bribed to betray their
masters, freedmen their patrons, and those who were without enemies
brought to destruction by their friends; and then he will know the true
nature of the debt which Rome, Italy, and the world owe to Cæsar; and
if he possess a spark of human feeling, will turn from the example of
those evil times, and kindle with a consuming passion to imitate those
which were good.

And in truth the prince who seeks for worldly glory should desire to be
the ruler of a corrupt city; not that, like Cæsar, he may destroy it,
but that, like Romulus, he may restore it; since man cannot hope for,
nor Heaven offer any better opportunity of fame. Were it indeed
necessary in giving a constitution to a State to forfeit its
sovereignty, the prince who, to retain his station, should withhold a
constitution, might plead excuse; but for him who in giving a
constitution can still retain his sovereignty, no excuse is to be made.

Let those therefore to whom Heaven has afforded this opportunity,
remember that two courses lie open to them; one which will render them
secure while they live and glorious when they die; another which
exposes them to continual difficulties in life, and condemns them to
eternal infamy after death.




CHAPTER XI.—_Of the Religion of the Romans._


Though Rome had Romulus for her first founder, and as a daughter owed
him her being and nurture, nevertheless, when the institutions of
Romulus were seen by Heaven to be insufficient for so great a State,
the Roman senate were moved to choose Numa Pompilius as his successor,
that he might look to all matters which Romulus had neglected. He
finding the people fierce and turbulent, and desiring with the help of
the peaceful arts to bring them to order and obedience, called in the
aid of religion as essential to the maintenance of civil society, and
gave it such a form, that for many ages God was nowhere so much feared
as in that republic. The effect of this was to render easy any
enterprise in which the senate or great men of Rome thought fit to
engage. And whosoever pays heed to an infinity of actions performed,
sometimes by the Roman people collectively, often by single citizens,
will see, that esteeming the power of God beyond that of man, they
dreaded far more to violate their oath than to transgress the laws; as
is clearly shown by the examples of Scipio and of Manlius Torquatus.
For after the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal at Cannæ, many citizens
meeting together, resolved, in their terror and dismay, to abandon
Italy and seek refuge in Sicily. But Scipio, getting word of this, went
among them, and menacing them with his naked sword, made them swear
never to abandon their country. Again, when Lucius Manlius was accused
by the tribune Marcus Pomponius, before the day fixed for trial, Titus
Manlius, afterwards named Torquatus, son to Lucius, went to seek this
Marcus, and threatening him with death if he did not withdraw the
charge against his father, compelled him to swear compliance; and he,
through fear, having sworn, kept his oath. In the first of these two
instances, therefore, citizens whom love of their country and its laws
could not have retained in Italy, were kept there by the oath forced
upon them; and in the second, the tribune Marcus, to keep his oath,
laid aside the hatred he bore the father, and overlooked the injury
done him by the son, and his own dishonour. And this from no other
cause than the religion which Numa had impressed upon this city.

And it will be plain to any one who carefully studies Roman History,
how much religion helped in disciplining the army, in uniting the
people, in keeping good men good, and putting bad men to shame; so that
had it to be decided to which prince, Romulus or Numa, Rome owed the
greater debt, I think the balance must turn in favour of Numa; for when
religion is once established you may readily bring in arms; but where
you have arms without religion it is not easy afterwards to bring in
religion. We see, too, that while Romulus in order to create a senate,
and to establish his other ordinances civil and military, needed no
support from Divine authority, this was very necessary to Numa, who
feigned to have intercourse with a Nymph by whose advice he was guided
in counselling the people. And this, because desiring to introduce in
Rome new and untried institutions, he feared that his own authority
might not effect his end. Nor, indeed, has any attempt ever been made
to introduce unusual laws among a people, without resorting to Divine
authority, since without such sanction they never would have been
accepted. For the wise recognize many things to be good which do not
bear such reasons on the face of them as command their acceptance by
others; wherefore, wise men who would obviate these difficulties, have
recourse to Divine aid. Thus did Lycurgus, thus Solon, and thus have
done many besides who have had the same end in view.

The Romans, accordingly, admiring the prudence and virtues of Numa,
assented to all the measures which he recommended. This, however, is to
be said, that the circumstance of these times being deeply tinctured
with religious feeling, and of the men with whom he had to deal being
rude and ignorant, gave Numa better facility to carry out his plans, as
enabling him to mould his subjects readily to any new impression. And,
doubtless, he who should seek at the present day to form a new
commonwealth, would find the task easier among a race of simple
mountaineers, than among the dwellers in cities where society is
corrupt; as the sculptor can more easily carve a fair statue from a
rough block, than from the block which has been badly shaped out by
another. But taking all this into account, I maintain that the religion
introduced by Numa was one of the chief causes of the prosperity of
Rome, since it gave rise to good ordinances, which in turn brought with
them good fortune, and with good fortune, happy issues to whatsoever
was undertaken.

And as the observance of the ordinances of religion is the cause of the
greatness of a State, so their neglect is the occasion of its decline;
since a kingdom without the fear of God must either fall to pieces, or
must be maintained by the fear of some prince who supplies that
influence not supplied by religion. But since the lives of princes are
short, the life of this prince, also, and with it his influence, must
soon come to an end; whence it happens that a kingdom which rests
wholly on the qualities of its prince, lasts for a brief time only;
because these qualities, terminating with his life, are rarely renewed
in his successor. For as Dante wisely says:—

“Seldom through the boughs
Doth human worth renew itself; for such
The will of Him who gives it, that to Him
We may ascribe it.”[1]


 [1] Rade volta risurge per li rami
L’umana probitate: e questo vuole
Quei che la dà, perchè da lui si chiami.
          _Purg_. vii. 121-123.]


It follows, therefore, that the safety of a commonwealth or kingdom
lies, not in its having a ruler who governs it prudently while he
lives, but in having one who so orders things, that when he dies, the
State may still maintain itself. And though it be easier to impose new
institutions or a new faith on rude and simple men, it is not therefore
impossible to persuade their adoption by men who are civilized, and who
do not think themselves rude. The people of Florence do not esteem
themselves rude or ignorant, and yet were persuaded by the Friar
Girolamo Savonarola that he spoke with God. Whether in this he said
truth or no, I take not on me to pronounce, since of so great a man we
must speak with reverence; but this I do say, that very many believed
him without having witnessed anything extraordinary to warrant their
belief; his life, his doctrines, the matter whereof he treated, being
sufficient to enlist their faith.

Let no man, therefore, lose heart from thinking that he cannot do what
others have done before him; for, as I said in my Preface, men are
born, and live, and die, always in accordance with the same rules.




CHAPTER XII.—That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and
that Italy, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been
ruined.


Princes and commonwealths that would save themselves from growing
corrupted, should before all things keep uncorrupted the rites and
ceremonies of religion, and always hold them in reverence; since we can
have no surer sign of the decay of a province than to see Divine
worship held therein in contempt. This is easily understood when it is
seen on what foundation that religion rests in which a man is born. For
every religion has its root in certain fundamental ordinances peculiar
to itself.

The religion of the Gentiles had its beginning in the responses of the
oracles and in the prognostics of the augurs and soothsayers. All their
other ceremonies and observances depended upon these; because men
naturally believed that the God who could forecast their future weal or
woe, could also bring them to pass. Wherefore the temples, the prayers,
the sacrifices, and all the other rites of their worship, had their
origin in this, that the oracles of Delos, of Dodona, and others
celebrated in antiquity, held the world admiring and devout. But,
afterwards, when these oracles began to shape their answers to suit the
interests of powerful men, and their impostures to be seen through by
the multitude, men grew incredulous and ready to overturn every sacred
institution. For which reason, the rulers of kingdoms and commonwealths
should maintain the foundations of the faith which they hold; since
thus it will be easy for them to keep their country religious, and,
consequently, virtuous and united. To which end they should countenance
and further whatsoever tells in favour of religion, even should they
think it untrue; and the wiser they are, and the better they are
acquainted with natural causes, the more ought they to do so. It is
from this course having been followed by the wise, that the miracles
celebrated even in false religions, have come to be held in repute; for
from whatever source they spring, discreet men will extol them, whose
authority afterwards gives them currency everywhere.

These miracles were common enough in Rome, and among others this was
believed, that when the Roman soldiers were sacking the city of Veii,
certain of them entered the temple of Juno and spoke to the statue of
the goddess, saying, “_Wilt thou come with us to Rome?_” when to some
it seemed that she inclined her head in assent, and to others that they
heard her answer, “_Yea_.” For these men being filled with religious
awe (which Titus Livius shows us by the circumstance that, in entering
the temple, they entered devoutly, reverently, and without tumult),
persuaded themselves they heard that answer to their question, which,
perhaps, they had formed beforehand in their minds. But their faith and
belief were wholly approved of and confirmed by Camillus and by the
other chief men of the city.

Had religion been maintained among the princes of Christendom on the
footing on which it was established by its Founder, the Christian
States and republics had been far more united and far more prosperous
than they now are; nor can we have surer proof of its decay than in
witnessing how those countries which are the nearest neighbours of the
Roman Church, the head of our faith, have less devoutness than any
others; so that any one who considers its earliest beginnings and
observes how widely different is its present practice, might well
believe its ruin or its chastisement to be close at hand.

But since some are of opinion that the welfare of Italy depends upon
the Church of Rome, I desire to put forward certain arguments which
occur to me against that view, and shall adduce two very strong ones,
which, to my mind, admit of no answer. The first is, that, through the
ill example of the Roman Court, the country has lost all religious
feeling and devoutness, a loss which draws after it infinite mischiefs
and disorders; for as the presence of religion implies every
excellence, so the contrary is involved in its absence. To the Church,
therefore, and to the priests, we Italians owe this first debt, that
through them we have become wicked and irreligious. And a still greater
debt we owe them for what is the immediate cause of our ruin, namely,
that by the Church our country is kept divided. For no country was ever
united or prosperous which did not yield obedience to some one prince
or commonwealth, as has been the case with France and Spain. And the
Church is the sole cause why Italy stands on a different footing, and
is subject to no one king or commonwealth. For though she holds here
her seat, and exerts her temporal authority, she has never yet gained
strength and courage to seize upon the entire country, or make herself
supreme; yet never has been so weak that when in fear of losing her
temporal dominion, she could not call in some foreign potentate to aid
her against any Italian State by which she was overmatched. Of which we
find many instances, both in early times, as when by the intervention
of Charles the Great she drove the Lombards, who had made themselves
masters of nearly the whole country, out of Italy; and also in recent
times, as when, with the help of France, she first stripped the
Venetians of their territories, and then, with the help of the Swiss,
expelled the French.

The Church, therefore, never being powerful enough herself to take
possession of the entire country, while, at the same time, preventing
any one else from doing so, has made it impossible to bring Italy under
one head; and has been the cause of her always living subject to many
princes or rulers, by whom she has been brought to such division and
weakness as to have become a prey, not to Barbarian kings only, but to
any who have thought fit to attack her. For this, I say, we Italians
have none to thank but the Church. And were any man powerful enough to
transplant the Court of Rome, with all the authority it now wields over
the rest of Italy, into the territories of the Swiss (the only people
who at this day, both as regards religion and military discipline, live
like the ancients,) he would have clear proof of the truth of what I
affirm, and would find that the corrupt manners of that Court had, in a
little while, wrought greater mischief in these territories than any
other disaster which could ever befall them.




CHAPTER XIII.—_Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving
Institutions to their City, in carrying out their Enterprises, and in
quelling Tumults._


Here it seems to me not out of place to cite instances of the Romans
seeking assistance from religion in reforming their institutions and in
carrying out their warlike designs. And although many such are related
by Titus Livius, I content myself with mentioning the following only:
The Romans having appointed tribunes with consular powers, all of them,
save one, plebeians, it so chanced that in that very year they were
visited by plague and famine, accompanied by many strange portents.
Taking occasion from this, the nobles, at the next creation of
tribunes, gave out that the gods were angry with Rome for lowering the
majesty of her government, nor could be appeased but by the choice of
tribunes being restored to a fair footing. Whereupon the people,
smitten with religious awe, chose all the tribunes from the nobles.
Again, at the siege of Veii, we find the Roman commanders making use of
religion to keep the minds of their men well disposed towards that
enterprise. For when, in the last year of the siege, the soldiers,
disgusted with their protracted service, began to clamour to be led
back to Rome, on the Alban lake suddenly rising to an uncommon height,
it was found that the oracles at Delphi and elsewhere had foretold that
Veii should fall that year in which the Alban lake overflowed. The hope
of near victory thus excited in the minds of the soldiers, led them to
put up with the weariness of the war, and to continue in arms; until,
on Camillus being named dictator, Veii was taken after a ten years’
siege. In these cases, therefore, we see religion, wisely used, assist
in the reduction of this city, and in restoring the tribuneship to the
nobles; neither of which ends could well have been effected without it.

One other example bearing on the same subject I must not omit. Constant
disturbances were occasioned in Rome by the tribune Terentillus, who,
for reasons to be noticed in their place, sought to pass a certain law.
The nobles, in their efforts to baffle him, had recourse to religion,
which they sought to turn to account in two ways. For first they caused
the Sibylline books to be searched, and a feigned answer returned, that
in that year the city ran great risk of losing its freedom through
civil discord; which fraud, although exposed by the tribunes,
nevertheless aroused such alarm in the minds of the commons that they
slackened in their support of their leaders. Their other contrivance
was as follows: A certain Appius Herdonius, at the head of a band of
slaves and outlaws, to the number of four thousand, having seized the
Capitol by night, an alarm was spread that were the Equians and
Volscians, those perpetual enemies of the Roman name, then to attack
the city, they might succeed in taking it. And when, in spite of this,
the tribunes stubbornly persisted in their efforts to pass the law,
declaring the act of Herdonius to be a device of the nobles and no real
danger. Publius Rubetius, a citizen of weight and authority, came forth
from the Senate House, and in words partly friendly and partly
menacing, showed them the peril in which the city stood, and that their
demands were unseasonable; and spoke to such effect that the commons
bound themselves by oath to stand by the consul; in fulfilment of which
engagement they aided the consul, Publius Valerius, to carry the
Capitol by assault. But Valerius being slain in the attack, Titus
Quintius was at once appointed in his place, who, to leave the people
no breathing time, nor suffer their thoughts to revert to the
Terentillian law, ordered them to quit Rome and march against the
Volscians; declaring them bound to follow him by virtue of the oath
they had sworn not to desert the consul. And though the tribunes
withstood him, contending that the oath had been sworn to the dead
consul and not to Quintius, yet the people under the influence of
religious awe, chose rather to obey the consul than believe the
tribunes. And Titus Livius commends their behaviour when he says:
“_That neglect of the gods which now prevails, had not then made its
way nor was it then the practice for every man to interpret his oath,
or the laws, to suit his private ends_.” The tribunes accordingly,
fearing to lose their entire ascendency, consented to obey the consul,
and to refrain for a year from moving in the matter of the Terentillian
law; while the consuls, on their part, undertook that for a year the
commons should not be called forth to war. And thus, with the help of
religion, the senate were able to overcome a difficulty which they
never could have overcome without it.




CHAPTER XIV.—_That the Romans interpreted the Auspices to meet the
occasion; and made a prudent show of observing the Rites of Religion
even when forced to disregard them; and any who rashly slighted
Religion they punished._


Auguries were not only, as we have shown above, a main foundation of
the old religion of the Gentiles, but were also the cause of the
prosperity of the Roman commonwealth. Accordingly, the Romans gave more
heed to these than to any other of their observances; resorting to them
in their consular comitia; in undertaking new enterprises; in calling
out their armies; in going into battle; and, in short, in every
business of importance, whether civil or military. Nor would they ever
set forth on any warlike expedition, until they had satisfied their
soldiers that the gods had promised them victory.

Among other means of declaring the auguries, they had in their armies a
class of soothsayers, named by them _pullarii_, whom, when they desired
to give battle, they would ask to take the auspices, which they did by
observing the behaviour of fowls. If the fowls pecked, the engagement
was begun with a favourable omen. If they refused, battle was declined.
Nevertheless, when it was plain on the face of it that a certain course
had to be taken, they would take it at all hazards, even though the
auspices were adverse; contriving, however, to manage matters so
adroitly as not to appear to throw any slight on religion; as was done
by the consul Papirius in the great battle he fought with the Samnites
wherein that nation was finally broken and overthrown. For Papirius
being encamped over against the Samnites, and perceiving that if he
fought, victory was certain, and consequently being eager to engage,
desired the omens to be taken. The fowls refused to peck; but the chief
soothsayer observing the eagerness of the soldiers to fight and the
confidence felt both by them and by their captain, not to deprive the
army of such an opportunity of glory, reported to the consul that the
auspices were favourable. Whereupon Papirius began to array his army
for battle. But some among the soothsayers having divulged to certain
of the soldiers that the fowls had not pecked, this was told to Spurius
Papirius, the nephew of the consul, who reporting it to his uncle, the
latter straightway bade him mind his own business, for that so far as
he himself and the army were concerned, the auspices were fair; and if
the soothsayer had lied, the consequences were on his head. And that
the event might accord with the prognostics, he commanded his officers
to place the soothsayers in front of the battle. It so chanced that as
they advanced against the enemy, the chief soothsayer was killed by a
spear thrown by a Roman soldier; which, the consul hearing of, said,
“_All goes well, and as the Gods would have it, for by the death of
this liar the army is purged of blame and absolved from whatever
displeasure these may have conceived against it_.” And contriving, in
this way to make his designs tally with the auspices, he joined battle,
without the army knowing that the ordinances of religion had in any
degree been disregarded.

But an opposite course was taken by Appius Pulcher, in Sicily, in the
first Carthaginian war. For desiring to join battle, he bade the
soothsayers take the auspices, and on their announcing that the fowls
refused to feed, he answered, “_Let us see, then, whether they will
drink,_” and, so saying, caused them to be thrown into the sea. After
which he fought and was defeated. For this he was condemned at Rome,
while Papirius was honoured; not so much because the one had gained
while the other had lost a battle, as because in their treatment of the
auspices the one had behaved discreetly, the other with rashness. And,
in truth, the sole object of this system of taking the auspices was to
insure the army joining battle with that confidence of success which
constantly leads to victory; a device followed not by the Romans only,
but by foreign nations as well; of which I shall give an example in the
following Chapter.




CHAPTER XV.—_How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken
Fortunes, had recourse to Religion._


The Samnites, who before had met with many defeats at the hands of the
Romans, were at last decisively routed by them in Etruria, where their
armies were cut to pieces and their commanders slain. And because their
allies also, such as the Etruscans, the Umbrians, and the Gauls, were
likewise vanquished, they “_could now no longer_” as Livius tells us,
“_either trust to their own strength or to foreign aid; yet, for all
that, would not cease from hostilities, nor resign themselves to
forfeit the liberty which they had unsuccessfully defended, preferring
new defeats to an inglorious submission._” They resolved, therefore, to
make a final effort; and as they knew that victory was only to be
secured by inspiring their soldiers with a stubborn courage, to which
end nothing could help so much as religion, at the instance of their
high priest, Ovius Paccius, they revived an ancient sacrificial rite
performed by them in the manner following. After offering solemn
sacrifice they caused all the captains of their armies, standing
between the slain victims and the smoking altars, to swear never to
abandon the war. They then summoned the common soldiers, one by one,
and before the same altars, and surrounded by a ring of many centurions
with drawn swords, first bound them by oath never to reveal what they
might see or hear; and then, after imprecating the Divine wrath, and
reciting the most terrible incantations, made them vow and swear to the
gods, as they would not have a curse light on their race and offspring,
to follow wherever their captains led, never to turn back from battle,
and to put any they saw turn back to death. Some who in their terror
declined to swear, were forthwith slain by the centurions. The rest,
warned by their cruel fate, complied. Assembling thereafter to the
number of forty thousand, one-half of whom, to render their appearance
of unusual splendour were clad in white, with plumes and crests over
their helmets, they took up their ground in the neighbourhood of
Aquilonia. But Papirius, being sent against them, bade his soldiers be
of good cheer, telling them “_that feathers made no wounds, and that a
Roman spear would pierce a painted shield;_” and to lessen the effect
which the oath taken by the Samnites had upon the minds of the Romans,
he said that such an oath must rather distract than strengthen those
bound by it, since they had to fear, at once, their enemies, their
comrades, and their Gods. In the battle which ensued, the Samnites were
routed, any firmness lent them by religion or by the oath they had
sworn, being balanced by the Roman valour, and the terror inspired by
past defeats. Still we see that, in their own judgment, they had no
other refuge to which to turn, nor other remedy for restoring their
broken hopes; and this is strong testimony to the spirit which religion
rightly used can arouse.

Some of the incidents which I have now been considering may be thought
to relate rather to the foreign than to the domestic affairs of Rome,
which last alone form the proper subject of this Book; nevertheless
since the matter connects itself with one of the most important
institutions of the Roman republic, I have thought it convenient to
notice it here, so as not to divide the subject and be obliged to
return to it hereafter.




CHAPTER XVI.—_That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by
any accident it become free, can hardly preserve that Freedom._


Should a people accustomed to live under a prince by any accident
become free, as did the Romans on the expulsion of the Tarquins, we
know from numberless instances recorded in ancient history, how hard it
will be for it to maintain that freedom. And this is no more than we
might expect. For a people in such circumstances may be likened to the
wild animal which, though destined by nature to roam at large in the
woods, has been reared in the cage and in constant confinement and
which, should it chance to be set free in the open country, being
unused to find its own food, and unfamiliar with the coverts where it
might lie concealed, falls a prey to the first who seeks to recapture
it. Even thus it fares with the people which has been accustomed to be
governed by others; since ignorant how to act by itself either for
attack or defence, and neither knowing foreign princes nor being known
of them, it is speedily brought back under the yoke, and often under a
heavier yoke than that from which it has just freed its neck. These
difficulties will be met with, even where the great body of the
citizens has not become wholly corrupted; but where the corruption is
complete, freedom, as shall presently be shown, is not merely fleeting
but impossible. Wherefore my remarks are to be taken as applying to
those States only wherein corruption has as yet made no great progress,
and in which there is more that is sound than unsound.

To the difficulties above noticed, another has to be added, which is,
that a State in becoming free makes for itself bitter enemies but not
warm friends. All become its bitter enemies who, drawing their support
from the wealth of the tyrant, flourished under his government. For
these men, when the causes which made them powerful are withdrawn, can
no longer live contented, but are one and all impelled to attempt the
restoration of the tyranny in hopes of regaining their former
importance. On the other hand, as I have said, the State which becomes
free does not gain for itself warm friends. For a free government
bestows its honours and rewards in accordance with certain fixed rules,
and on considerations of merit, without which none is honoured or
rewarded. But when a man obtains only those honours or rewards which he
seems to himself to deserve, he will never admit that he is under any
obligation to those who bestow them. Moreover the common benefits that
all derive from a free government, which consist in the power to enjoy
what is our own, openly and undisturbed, in having to feel no anxiety
for the honour of wife or child, nor any fear for personal safety, are
hardly recognized by men while they still possess them, since none will
ever confess obligation to him who merely refrains from injury. For
these reasons, I repeat, a State which has recently become free, is
likely to have bitter enemies and no warm friends.

Now, to meet these difficulties and their attendant disorders, there is
no more potent, effectual, wholesome, and necessary remedy than _to
slay the sons of Brutus_. They, as the historian tells us, were along
with other young Romans led to conspire against their country, simply
because the unusual privileges which they had enjoyed under the kings,
were withheld under the consuls; so that to them it seemed as though
the freedom of the people implied their servitude. Any one, therefore,
who undertakes to control a people, either as their prince or as the
head of a commonwealth, and does not make sure work with all who are
hostile to his new institutions, founds a government which cannot last
long. Undoubtedly those princes are to be reckoned unhappy, who, to
secure their position, are forced to advance by unusual and irregular
paths, and with the people for their enemies. For while he who has to
deal with a few adversaries only, can easily and without much or
serious difficulty secure himself, he who has an entire people against
him can never feel safe and the greater the severity he uses the weaker
his authority becomes; so that his best course is to strive to make the
people his friends.

But since these views may seem to conflict with what I have said above,
treating there of a republic and here of a prince, that I may not have
to return to the subject again, I will in this place discuss it
briefly. Speaking, then of those princes who have become the tyrants of
their country, I say that the prince who seeks to gain over an
unfriendly people should first of all examine what it is the people
really desire, and he will always find that they desire two things:
first, to be revenged upon those who are the cause of their servitude;
and second, to regain their freedom. The first of these desires the
prince can gratify wholly, the second in part. As regards the former,
we have an instance exactly in point. Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea,
being in exile, it so happened that on a feud arising between the
commons and the nobles of that city, the latter, perceiving they were
weaker than their adversaries, began to look with favour on Clearchus,
and conspiring with him, in opposition to the popular voice recalled
him to Heraclea and deprived the people of their freedom. Clearchus
finding himself thus placed between the arrogance of the nobles, whom
he could in no way either satisfy or correct, and the fury of the
people, who could not put up with the loss of their freedom, resolved
to rid himself at a stroke from the harassment of the nobles and
recommend himself to the people. Wherefore, watching his opportunity,
he caused all the nobles to be put to death, and thus, to the extreme
delight of the people, satisfied one of those desires by which they are
possessed, namely, the desire for vengeance.

As for the other desire of the people, namely, to recover their
freedom, the prince, since he never can content them in this, should
examine what the causes are which make them long to be free; and he
will find a very few of them desiring freedom that they may obtain
power, but all the rest, whose number is countless, only desiring it
that they may live securely. For in all republics, whatever the form of
their government, barely forty or fifty citizens have any place in the
direction of affairs; who, from their number being so small, can easily
be reckoned with, either by making away with them, or by allowing them
such a share of honours as, looking to their position, may reasonably
content them. All those others whose sole aim it is to live safely, are
well contented where the prince enacts such laws and ordinances as
provide for the general security, while they establish his own
authority; and when he does this, and the people see that nothing
induces him to violate these laws, they soon begin to live happily and
without anxiety. Of this we have an example in the kingdom of France,
which enjoys perfect security from this cause alone, that its kings are
bound to compliance with an infinity of laws upon which the well-being
of the whole people depends. And he who gave this State its
constitution allowed its kings to do as they pleased as regards arms
and money; but provided that as regards everything else they should not
interfere save as the laws might direct. Those rulers, therefore, who
omit to provide sufficiently for the safety of their government at the
outset, must, like the Romans, do so on the first occasion which
offers; and whoever lets the occasion slip, will repent too late of not
having acted as he should. The Romans, however, being still uncorrupted
at the time when they recovered their freedom, were able, after slaying
the sons of Brutus and getting rid of the Tarquins, to maintain it with
all those safeguards and remedies which we have elsewhere considered.
But had they already become corrupted, no remedy could have been found,
either in Rome or out of it, by which their freedom could have been
secured; as I shall show in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER XVII.—_That a corrupt People obtaining Freedom can hardly
preserve it._


I believe that if her kings had not been expelled, Rome must very soon
have become a weak and inconsiderable State. For seeing to what a pitch
of corruption these kings had come, we may conjecture that if two or
three more like reigns had followed, and the taint spread from the head
to the members, so soon as the latter became infected, cure would have
been hopeless. But from the head being removed while the trunk was
still sound, it was not difficult for the Romans to return to a free
and constitutional government.

It may be assumed, however, as most certain, that a corrupted city
living under a prince can never recover its freedom, even were the
prince and all his line to be exterminated. For in such a city it must
necessarily happen that one prince will be replaced by another, and
that things will never settle down until a new lord be established;
unless, indeed, the combined goodness and valour of some one citizen
should maintain freedom, which, even then, will endure only for his
lifetime; as happened twice in Syracuse, first under the rule of Dion,
and again under that of Timoleon, whose virtues while they lived kept
their city free, but on whose death it fell once more under a tyranny.

But the strongest example that can be given is that of Rome, which on
the expulsion of the Tarquins was able at once to seize on liberty and
to maintain it; yet, on the deaths of Cæsar, Caligula, and Nero, and on
the extinction of the Julian line, was not only unable to establish her
freedom, but did not even venture a step in that direction. Results so
opposite arising in one and the same city can only be accounted for by
this, that in the time of the Tarquins the Roman people were not yet
corrupted, but in these later times had become utterly corrupt. For on
the first occasion, nothing more was needed to prepare and determine
them to shake off their kings, than that they should be bound by oath
to suffer no king ever again to reign in Rome; whereas, afterwards, the
authority and austere virtue of Brutus, backed by all the legions of
the East, could not rouse them to maintain their hold of that freedom,
which he, following in the footsteps of the first Brutus, had won for
them; and this because of the corruption wherewith the people had been
infected by the Marian faction, whereof Cæsar becoming head, was able
so to blind the multitude that it saw not the yoke under which it was
about to lay its neck.

Though this example of Rome be more complete than any other, I desire
to instance likewise, to the same effect, certain peoples well known in
our own days; and I maintain that no change, however grave or violent,
could ever restore freedom to Naples or Milan, because in these States
the entire body of the people has grown corrupted. And so we find that
Milan, although desirous to return to a free form of government, on the
death of Filippo Visconti, had neither the force nor the skill needed
to preserve it.

Most fortunate, therefore, was it for Rome that her kings grew corrupt
soon, so as to be driven out before the taint of their corruption had
reached the vitals of the city. For it was because these were sound
that the endless commotions which took place in Rome, so far from being
hurtful, were, from their object being good, beneficial to the
commonwealth. From which we may draw this inference, that where the
body of the people is still sound, tumults and other like disorders do
little hurt, but that where it has become corrupted, laws, however well
devised, are of no advantage, unless imposed by some one whose
paramount authority causes them to be observed until the community be
once more restored to a sound and healthy condition.

Whether this has ever happened I know not, nor whether it ever can
happen. For we see, as I have said a little way back, that a city which
owing to its pervading corruption has once begun to decline, if it is
to recover at all, must be saved not by the excellence of the people
collectively, but of some one man then living among them, on whose
death it at once relapses into its former plight; as happened with
Thebes, in which the virtue of Epaminondas made it possible while he
lived to preserve the form of a free Government, but which fell again
on his death into its old disorders; the reason being that hardly any
ruler lives so long as to have time to accustom to right methods a city
which has long been accustomed to wrong. Wherefore, unless things be
put on a sound footing by some one ruler who lives to a very advanced
age, or by two virtuous rulers succeeding one another, the city upon
their death at once falls back into ruin; or, if it be preserved, must
be so by incurring great risks, and at the cost of much blood. For the
corruption I speak of, is wholly incompatible with a free government,
because it results from an inequality which pervades the State and can
only be removed by employing unusual and very violent remedies, such as
few are willing or know how to employ, as in another place I shall more
fully explain.




CHAPTER XVIII.—_How a Free Government existing in a corrupt City may be
preserved, or not existing may be created._


I think it neither out of place, nor inconsistent with what has been
said above, to consider whether a free government existing in a corrupt
city can be maintained, or, not existing, can be introduced. And on
this head I say that it is very difficult to bring about either of
these results, and next to impossible to lay down rules as to how it
may be done; because the measures to be taken must vary with the degree
of corruption which prevails.

Nevertheless, since it is well to reason things out, I will not pass
this matter by, but will assume, in the first place, the case of a very
corrupt city, and then take the case of one in which corruption has
reached a still greater height; but where corruption is universal, no
laws or institutions will ever have force to restrain it. Because as
good customs stand in need of good laws for their support, so laws,
that they may be respected, stand in need of good customs. Moreover,
the laws and institutions established in a republic at its beginning,
when men were good, are no longer suitable when they have become bad;
but while the laws of a city are altered to suit its circumstances, its
institutions rarely or never change; whence it results that the
introduction of new laws is of no avail, because the institutions,
remaining unchanged, corrupt them.

And to make this plainer, I say that in Rome it was first of all the
institutions of the State, and next the laws as enforced by the
magistrates, which kept the citizens under control. The institutions of
the State consisted in the authority of the people, the senate, the
tribunes, and the consuls; in the methods of choosing and appointing
magistrates; and in the arrangements for passing laws. These
institutions changed little, if at all, with circumstances. But the
laws by which the people were controlled, as for instance the law
relating to adultery, the sumptuary laws, the law as to canvassing at
elections, and many others, were altered as the citizens grew more and
more corrupted. Hence, the institutions of the State remaining the same
although from the corruption of the people no longer suitable,
amendments in the laws could not keep men good, though they might have
proved very useful if at the time when they were made the institutions
had likewise been reformed.

That its original institutions are no longer adapted to a city that has
become corrupted, is plainly seen in two matters of great moment, I
mean in the appointment of magistrates and in the passing of laws. For
the Roman people conferred the consulship and other great offices of
their State on none save those who sought them; which was a good
institution at first, because then none sought these offices save those
who thought themselves worthy of them, and to be rejected was held
disgraceful; so that, to be deemed worthy, all were on their best
behaviour. But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most
mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those
who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were
without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This
untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar
results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and
reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became
perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer
to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and
the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the
consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting
for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those
who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of
selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had
most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their
institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.

Again, as to making laws, any of the tribunes and certain others of the
magistrates were entitled to submit laws to the people; but before
these were passed it was open to every citizen to speak either for or
against them. This was a good system so long as the citizens were good,
since it is always well that every man should be able to propose what
he thinks may be of use to his country, and that all should be allowed
to express their views with regard to his proposal; so that the people,
having heard all, may resolve on what is best. But when the people grew
depraved, this became a very mischievous institution; for then it was
only the powerful who proposed laws, and these not in the interest of
public freedom but of their own authority; and because, through fear,
none durst speak against the laws they proposed, the people were either
deceived or forced into voting their own destruction.

In order, therefore, that Rome after she had become corrupted might
still preserve her freedom, it was necessary that, as in the course of
events she had made new laws, so likewise she should frame new
institutions, since different institutions and ordinances are needed in
a corrupt State from those which suit a State which is not corrupted;
for where the matter is wholly dissimilar, the form cannot be similar.

But since old institutions must either be reformed all at once, as soon
as they are seen to be no longer expedient, or else gradually, as the
imperfection of each is recognized, I say that each of these two
courses is all but impossible. For to effect a gradual reform requires
a sagacious man who can discern mischief while it is still remote and
in the germ. But it may well happen that no such person is found in a
city; or that, if found, he is unable to persuade others of what he is
himself persuaded. For men used to live in one way are loath to leave
it for another, especially when they are not brought face to face with
the evil against which they should guard, and only have it indicated to
them by conjecture. And as for a sudden reform of institutions which
are seen by all to be no longer good, I say that defects which are
easily discerned are not easily corrected, because for their correction
it is not enough to use ordinary means, these being in themselves
insufficient; but recourse must be had to extraordinary means, such as
violence and arms; and, as a preliminary, you must become prince of the
city, and be able to deal with it at your pleasure. But since the
restoration of a State to new political life presupposes a good man,
and to become prince of a city by violence presupposes a bad man, it
can, consequently, very seldom happen that, although the end be good, a
good man will be found ready to become a prince by evil ways, or that a
bad man having become a prince will be disposed to act virtuously, or
think of turning to good account his ill-acquired authority.

From all these causes comes the difficulty, or rather the
impossibility, which a corrupted city finds in maintaining an existing
free government, or in establishing a new one. So that had we to
establish or maintain a government in that city, it would be necessary
to give it a monarchical, rather than a popular form, in order that men
too arrogant to be restrained by the laws, might in some measure be
kept in check by a power almost absolute; since to attempt to make them
good otherwise would be a very cruel or a wholly futile endeavour.
This, as I have said, was the method followed by Cleomenes; and if he,
that he might stand alone, put to death the Ephori; and if Romulus,
with a like object, put to death his brother and Titus Tatius the
Sabine, and if both afterwards made good use of the authority they thus
acquired, it is nevertheless to be remembered that it was because
neither Cleomenes nor Romulus had to deal with so corrupt a people as
that of which I am now speaking, that they were able to effect their
ends and to give a fair colour to their acts.




CHAPTER XIX.—_After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself:
but after one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second._


When we contemplate the excellent qualities of Romulus, Numa, and
Tullus, the first three kings of Rome, and note the methods which they
followed, we recognize the extreme good fortune of that city in having
her first king fierce and warlike, her second peaceful and religious,
and her third, like the first, of a high spirit and more disposed to
war than to peace. For it was essential for Rome that almost at the
outset of her career, a ruler should be found to lay the foundations of
her civil life; but, after that had been done, it was necessary that
her rulers should return to the virtues of Romulus, since otherwise the
city must have grown feeble, and become a prey to her neighbours.

And here we may note that a prince who succeeds to another of superior
valour, may reign on by virtue of his predecessor’s merits, and reap
the fruits of his labours; but if he live to a great age, or if he be
followed by another who is wanting in the qualities of the first, that
then the kingdom must necessarily dwindle. Conversely, when two
consecutive princes are of rare excellence, we commonly find them
achieving results which win for them enduring renown. David, for
example, not only surpassed in learning and judgment, but was so
valiant in arms that, after conquering and subduing all his neighbours,
he left to his young son Solomon a tranquil State, which the latter,
though unskilled in the arts of war, could maintain by the arts of
peace, and thus happily enjoy the inheritance of his father’s valour.
But Solomon could not transmit this inheritance to his son Rehoboam,
who neither resembling his grandfather in valour, nor his father in
good fortune, with difficulty made good his right to a sixth part of
the kingdom. In like manner Bajazet, sultan of the Turks, though a man
of peace rather than of war, was able to enjoy the labours of Mahomet
his father, who, like David, having subdued his neighbours, left his
son a kingdom so safely established that it could easily be retained by
him by peaceful arts. But had Selim, son to Bajazet, been like his
father, and not like his grandfather, the Turkish monarchy must have
been overthrown; as it is, he seems likely to outdo the fame of his
grandsire.

I affirm it to be proved by these examples, that after a valiant prince
a feeble prince may maintain himself; but that no kingdom can stand
when two feeble princes follow in succession, unless, as in the case of
France, it be supported by its ancient ordinances. By feeble princes, I
mean such as are not valiant in war. And, to put the matter shortly, it
may be said, that the great valour of Romulus left Numa a period of
many years within which to govern Rome by peaceful arts; that after
Numa came Tullus, who renewed by his courage the fame of Romulus; and
that he in turn was succeeded by Ancus, a prince so gifted by nature
that he could equally avail himself of the methods of peace or war; who
setting himself at first to pursue the former, when he found that his
neighbours judged him to be effeminate, and therefore held him in
slight esteem, understood that to preserve Rome he must resort to arms
and resemble Romulus rather than Numa. From whose example every ruler
of a State may learn that a prince like Numa will hold or lose his
power according as fortune and circumstances befriend him; but that the
prince who resembles Romulus, and like him is fortified with foresight
and arms, will hold his State whatever befall, unless deprived of it by
some stubborn and irresistible force. For we may reckon with certainty
that if Rome had not had for her third king one who knew how to restore
her credit by deeds of valour, she could not, or at any rate not
without great difficulty, have afterwards held her ground, nor could
ever have achieved the great exploits she did.

And for these reasons Rome, while she lived under her kings, was in
constant danger of destruction through a king who might be weak or bad.




CHAPTER XX.—_That the consecutive Reigns of two valiant Princes produce
great results: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a
Succession of valiant Rulers by whom their Power and Growth are rapidly
extended_.


When Rome had driven out her kings, she was freed from those dangers to
which, as I have said, she was exposed by the possible succession of a
weak or wicked prince. For the chief share in the government then
devolved upon the consuls, who took their authority not by inheritance,
nor yet by craft or by ambitious violence, but by the free suffrages of
their fellow-citizens, and were always men of signal worth; by whose
valour and good fortune Rome being constantly aided, was able to reach
the height of her greatness in the same number of years as she had
lived under her kings. And since we find that two successive reigns of
valiant princes, as of Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander, suffice
to conquer the world, this ought to be still easier for a commonwealth,
which has it in its power to choose, not two excellent rulers only, but
an endless number in succession. And in every well ordered commonwealth
provision will be made for a succession of this sort.




CHAPTER XXI.—_That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a
Commonwealth to be without a national Army_.


Those princes and republics of the present day who lack forces of their
own, whether for attack or defence, should take shame to themselves,
and should be convinced by the example of Tullus, that their deficiency
does not arise from want of men fit for warlike enterprises, but from
their own fault in not knowing how to make their subjects good
soldiers. For after Rome had been at peace for forty years, Tullus,
succeeding to the kingdom, found not a single Roman who had ever been
in battle. Nevertheless when he made up his mind to enter on a war, it
never occurred to him to have recourse to the Samnites, or the
Etruscans, or to any other of the neighbouring nations accustomed to
arms, but he resolved, like the prudent prince he was, to rely on his
own countrymen. And such was his ability that, under his rule, the
people very soon became admirable soldiers. For nothing is more true
than that where a country, having men, lacks soldiers, it results from
some fault in its ruler, and not from any defect in the situation or
climate. Of this we have a very recent instance. Every one knows, how,
only the other day, the King of England invaded the realm of France
with an army raised wholly from among his own people, although from his
country having been at peace for thirty years, he had neither men nor
officers who had ever looked an enemy in the face. Nevertheless, he did
not hesitate with such troops as he had, to attack a kingdom well
provided with officers and excellent soldiers who had been constantly
under arms in the Italian wars. And this was possible through the
prudence of the English king and the wise ordinances of his kingdom,
which never in time of peace relaxes its warlike discipline. So too, in
old times, Pelopidas and Epaminondas the Thebans, after they had freed
Thebes from her tyrants, and rescued her from thraldom to Sparta,
finding themselves in a city used to servitude and surrounded by an
effeminate people, scrupled not, so great was their courage, to furnish
these with arms, and go forth with them to meet and to conquer the
Spartan forces on the field. And he who relates this, observes, that
these two captains very soon showed that warriors are not bred in
Lacedæmon alone, but in every country where men are found, if only some
one arise among them who knows how to direct them to arms; as we see
Tullus knew how to direct the Romans. Nor could Virgil better express
this opinion, or show by fitter words that he was convinced of its
truth than, when he says:—

“To arms shall Tullus rouse
His sluggish warriors.”[2]


 [2] Residesque movebit
Tullus in arma viros. _Virg. Aen_. vi. 814.




CHAPTER XXII.—_What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman
Horatii and the three Alban Curiatii_.


It was agreed between Tullus king of Rome, and Metius king of Alba,
that the nation whose champions were victorious in combat should rule
over the other. The three Alban Curiatii were slain; one of the Roman
Horatii survived. Whereupon the Alban king with all his people became
subject to the Romans. The surviving Horatius returning victorious to
Rome, and meeting his sister, wife to one of the dead Curiatii,
bewailing the death of her husband, slew her; and being tried for this
crime, was, after much contention, liberated, rather on the entreaties
of his father than for his own deserts.

Herein three points are to be noted. _First_, that we should never
peril our whole fortunes on the success of only a part of our forces.
_Second_, that in a well-governed State, merit should never be allowed
to balance crime. And _third_, that those are never wise covenants
which we cannot or should not expect to be observed. Now, for a State
to be enslaved is so terrible a calamity that it ought never to have
been supposed possible that either of these kings or nations would rest
content under a slavery resulting from the defeat of three only of
their number. And so it appeared to Metius; for although on the victory
of the Roman champions, he at once confessed himself vanquished, and
promised obedience; nevertheless, in the very first expedition which he
and Tullus undertook jointly against the people of Veii, we find him
seeking to circumvent the Roman, as though perceiving too late the rash
part he had played.

This is enough to say of the third point which I noted as deserving
attention. Of the other two I shall speak in the next two Chapters.




CHAPTER XXIII.—_That we should never hazard our whole Fortunes where we
put not forth our entire Strength; for which reason to guard a Defile
is often hurtful_.


It was never judged a prudent course to peril your whole fortunes where
you put not forth your whole strength; as may happen in more ways than
one. One of these ways was that taken by Tullus and Metius, when each
staked the existence of his country and the credit of his army on the
valour and good fortune of three only of his soldiers, that being an
utterly insignificant fraction of the force at his disposal. For
neither of these kings reflected that all the labours of their
predecessors in framing such institutions for their States, as might,
with the aid of the citizens themselves, maintain them long in freedom,
were rendered futile, when the power to ruin all was left in the hands
of so small a number. No rasher step, therefore, could have been taken,
than was taken by these kings.

A like risk is almost always incurred by those who, on the approach of
an enemy, resolve to defend some place of strength, or to guard the
defiles by which their country is entered. For unless room be found in
this place of strength for almost all your army, the attempt to hold it
will almost always prove hurtful. If you can find room, it will be
right to defend your strong places; but if these be difficult of
access, and you cannot there keep your entire force together, the
effort to defend is mischievous. I come to this conclusion from
observing the example of those who, although their territories be
enclosed by mountains and precipices, have not, on being attacked by
powerful enemies, attempted to fight on the mountains or in the
defiles, but have advanced beyond them to meet their foes; or, if
unwilling to advance, have awaited attack behind their mountains, on
level and not on broken ground. The reason of which is, as I have above
explained, that many men cannot be assembled in these strong places for
their defence; partly because a large number of men cannot long subsist
there, and partly because such places being narrow and confined, afford
room for a few only; so that no enemy can there be withstood, who comes
in force to the attack; which he can easily do, his design being to
pass on and not to make a stay; whereas he who stands on the defensive
cannot do so in force, because, from not knowing when the enemy may
enter the confined and sterile tracts of which I speak, he may have to
lodge himself there for a long time. But should you lose some pass
which you had reckoned on holding, and on the defence of which your
country and army have relied, there commonly follows such panic among
your people and among the troops which remain to you, that you are
vanquished without opportunity given for any display of valour, and
lose everything without bringing all your resources into play.

Every one has heard with what difficulty Hannibal crossed the Alps
which divide France from Lombardy, and afterwards those which separate
Lombardy from Tuscany. Nevertheless the Romans awaited him, in the
first instance on the banks of the Ticino, in the second on the plain
of Arezzo, preferring to be defeated on ground which at least gave them
a chance of victory, to leading their army into mountain fastnesses
where it was likely to be destroyed by the mere difficulties of the
ground. And any who read history with attention will find, that very
few capable commanders have attempted to hold passes of this nature, as
well for the reasons already given, as because to close them all were
impossible. For mountains, like plains, are traversed not only by
well-known and frequented roads, but also by many by-ways, which,
though unknown to strangers, are familiar to the people of the country,
under whose guidance you may always, and in spite of any opposition, be
easily conducted to whatever point you please. Of this we have a recent
instance in the events of the year 1515. For when Francis I. of France
resolved on invading Italy in order to recover the province of
Lombardy, those hostile to his attempt looked mainly to the Swiss, who
it was hoped would stop him in passing through their mountains. But
this hope was disappointed by the event. For leaving on one side two or
three defiles which were guarded by the Swiss, the king advanced by
another unknown pass, and was in Italy and upon his enemies before they
knew. Whereupon they fled terror-stricken into Milan; while the whole
population of Lombardy, finding themselves deceived in their
expectation that the French would be detained in the mountains, went
over to their side.




CHAPTER XXIV.—_That well-ordered States always provide Rewards and
Punishments for their Citizens; and never set off Deserts against
Misdeeds_.


The valour of Horatius in vanquishing the Curiatii deserved the highest
reward. But in slaying his sister he had been guilty of a heinous
crime. And so displeasing to the Romans was an outrage of this nature,
that although his services were so great and so recent, they brought
him to trial for his life. To one looking at it carelessly, this might
seem an instance of popular ingratitude, but he who considers the
matter more closely, and examines with sounder judgment what the
ordinances of a State should be, will rather blame the Roman people for
acquitting Horatius than for putting him on his trial. And this because
no well-ordered State ever strikes a balance between the services of
its citizens and their misdeeds; but appointing rewards for good
actions and punishment for bad, when it has rewarded a man for acting
well, will afterwards, should he act ill, chastise him, without regard
to his former deserts. When these ordinances are duly observed, a city
will live long in freedom, but when they are neglected, it must soon
come to ruin. For when a citizen has rendered some splendid service to
his country, if to the distinction which his action in itself confers,
were added an over-weening confidence that any crime he might
thenceforth commit would pass unpunished, he would soon become so
arrogant that no civil bonds could restrain him.

Still, while we would have punishment terrible to wrongdoers, it is
essential that good actions should be rewarded, as we see to have been
the case in Rome. For even where a republic is poor, and has but little
to give, it ought not to withhold that little; since a gift, however
small, bestowed as a reward for services however great, will always be
esteemed most honourable and precious by him who receives it. The story
of Horatius Cocles and that of Mutius Scævola are well known: how the
one withstood the enemy on the bridge while it was being cut down, and
the other thrust his hand into the fire in punishment of the mistake
made when he sought the life of Porsenna the Etruscan king. To each of
these two, in requital of their splendid deeds, two ploughgates only of
the public land were given. Another famous story is that of Manlius
Capitolinus, to whom, for having saved the Capitol from the besieging
Gauls, a small measure of meal was given by each of those who were shut
up with him during the siege. Which recompense, in proportion to the
wealth of the citizens of Rome at that time, was thought ample; so that
afterwards, when Manlius, moved by jealousy and malice, sought to
arouse sedition in Rome, and to gain over the people to his cause, they
without regard to his past services threw him headlong from that
Capitol in saving which he had formerly gained so great a renown.




CHAPTER XXV.—_That he who would reform the Institutions of a free
State, must retain at least the semblance of old Ways._


Whoever takes upon him to reform the government of a city, must, if his
measures are to be well received and carried out with general approval,
preserve at least the semblance of existing methods, so as not to
appear to the people to have made any change in the old order of
things; although, in truth, the new ordinances differ altogether from
those which they replace. For when this is attended to, the mass of
mankind accept what seems as what is; nay, are often touched more
nearly by appearances than by realities.

This tendency being recognized by the Romans at the very outset of
their civil freedom, when they appointed two consuls in place of a
single king, they would not permit the consuls to have more than twelve
lictors, in order that the old number of the king’s attendants might
not be exceeded. Again, there being solemnized every year in Rome a
sacrificial rite which could only be performed by the king in person,
that the people might not be led by the absence of the king to remark
the want of any ancient observance, a priest was appointed for the due
celebration of this rite, to whom was given the name of _Rex
sacrificulus_, and who was placed under the orders of the chief priest.
In this way the people were contented, and had no occasion from any
defect in the solemnities to desire the return of their kings. Like
precautions should be used by all who would put an end to the old
government of a city and substitute new and free institutions. For
since novelty disturbs men’s minds, we should seek in the changes we
make to preserve as far as possible what is ancient, so that if the new
magistrates differ from the old in number, in authority, or in the
duration of their office, they shall at least retain the old names.

This, I say, should be seen to by him who would establish a
constitutional government, whether in the form of a commonwealth or of
a kingdom. But he who would create an absolute government of the kind
which political writers term a tyranny, must renew everything, as shall
be explained in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER XXVI.—_A new Prince in a City or Province of which he has taken
Possession, ought to make Everything new._


Whosoever becomes prince of a city or State, more especially if his
position be so insecure that he cannot resort to constitutional
government either in the form of a republic or a monarchy, will find
that the best way to preserve his princedom is to renew the whole
institutions of that State; that is to say, to create new magistracies
with new names, confer new powers, and employ new men, and like David
when he became king, exalt the humble and depress the great, “_filling
the hungry with good things, and sending the rich empty away_.”
Moreover, he must pull down existing towns and rebuild them, removing
their inhabitants from one place to another; and, in short, leave
nothing in the country as he found it; so that there shall be neither
rank, nor condition, nor honour, nor wealth which its possessor can
refer to any but to him. And he must take example from Philip of
Macedon, the father of Alexander, who by means such as these, from
being a petty prince became monarch of all Greece; and of whom it was
written that he shifted men from province to province as a shepherd
moves his flocks from one pasture to another.

These indeed are most cruel expedients, contrary not merely to every
Christian, but to every civilized rule of conduct, and such as every
man should shun, choosing rather to lead a private life than to be a
king on terms so hurtful to mankind. But he who will not keep to the
fair path of virtue, must to maintain himself enter this path of evil.
Men, however, not knowing how to be wholly good or wholly bad, choose
for themselves certain middle ways, which of all others are the most
pernicious, as shall be shown by an instance in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER XXVII.—_That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly
bad_.


When in the year 1505, Pope Julius II. went to Bologna to expel from
that city the family of the Bentivogli, who had been princes there for
over a hundred years, it was also in his mind, as a part of the general
design he had planned against all those lords who had usurped Church
lands, to remove Giovanpagolo Baglioni, tyrant of Perugia. And coming
to Perugia with this intention and resolve, of which all men knew, he
would not wait to enter the town with a force sufficient for his
protection, but entered it unattended by troops, although Giovanpagolo
was there with a great company of soldiers whom he had assembled for
his defence. And thus, urged on by that impetuosity which stamped all
his actions, accompanied only by his body-guard, he committed himself
into the hands of his enemy, whom he forthwith carried away with him,
leaving a governor behind to hold the town for the Church. All prudent
men who were with the Pope remarked on his temerity, and on the
pusillanimity of Giovanpagolo; nor could they conjecture why the latter
had not, to his eternal glory, availed himself of this opportunity for
crushing his enemy, and at the same time enriching himself with
plunder, the Pope being attended by the whole College of Cardinals with
all their luxurious equipage. For it could not be supposed that he was
withheld by any promptings of goodness or scruples of conscience;
because in the breast of a profligate living in incest with his sister,
and who to obtain the princedom had put his nephews and kinsmen to
death, no virtuous impulse could prevail. So that the only inference to
be drawn was, that men know not how to be splendidly wicked or wholly
good, and shrink in consequence from such crimes as are stamped with an
inherent greatness or disclose a nobility of nature. For which reason
Giovanpagolo, who thought nothing of incurring the guilt of incest, or
of murdering his kinsmen, could not, or more truly durst not, avail
himself of a fair occasion to do a deed which all would have admired;
which would have won for him a deathless fame as the first to teach the
prelates how little those who live and reign as they do are to be
esteemed; and which would have displayed a greatness far transcending
any infamy or danger that could attach to it.




CHAPTER XXVIII.—_Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to
their Citizens than were the Athenians_.


In the histories of all republics we meet with instances of some sort
of ingratitude to their great citizens, but fewer in the history of
Rome than of Athens, or indeed of any other republic. Searching for the
cause of this, I am persuaded that, so far as regards Rome and Athens,
it was due to the Romans having had less occasion than the Athenians to
look upon their fellow-citizens with suspicion. For, from the expulsion
of her kings down to the times of Sylla and Marius, the liberty of Rome
was never subverted by any one of her citizens; so that there never was
in that city grave cause for distrusting any man, and in consequence
making him the victim of inconsiderate injustice. The reverse was
notoriously the case with Athens; for that city, having, at a time when
she was most flourishing, been deprived of her freedom by Pisistratus
under a false show of good-will, remembering, after she regained her
liberty, her former bondage and all the wrongs she had endured, became
the relentless chastiser, not of offences only on the part of her
citizens, but even of the shadow of an offence. Hence the banishment
and death of so many excellent men, and hence the law of ostracism, and
all those other violent measures which from time to time during the
history of that city were directed against her foremost citizens. For
this is most true which is asserted by the writers on civil government,
that a people which has recovered its freedom, bites more fiercely than
one which has always preserved it.

And any who shall weigh well what has been said, will not condemn
Athens in this matter, nor commend Rome, but refer all to the necessity
arising out of the different conditions prevailing in the two States.
For careful reflection will show that had Rome been deprived of her
freedom as Athens was, she would not have been a whit more tender to
her citizens. This we may reasonably infer from remarking what, after
the expulsion of the kings, befell Collatinus and Publius Valerius; the
former of whom, though he had taken part in the liberation of Rome, was
sent into exile for no other reason than that he bore the name of
Tarquin; while the sole ground of suspicion against the latter, and
what almost led to his banishment, was his having built a house upon
the Cælian hill. Seeing how harsh and suspicious Rome was in these two
instances, we may surmise that she would have shown the same
ingratitude as Athens, had she, like Athens, been wronged by her
citizens at an early stage of her growth, and before she had attained
to the fulness of her strength.

That I may not have to return to this question of ingratitude, I shall
say all that remains to be said about it in my next Chapter.




CHAPTER XXIX.—_Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful._


In connection with what has been said above, it seems proper to
consider whether more notable instances of ingratitude are supplied by
princes or peoples. And, to go to the root of the matter, I affirm that
this vice of ingratitude has its source either in avarice or in
suspicion. For a prince or people when they have sent forth a captain
on some important enterprise, by succeeding in which he earns a great
name, are bound in return to reward him; and if moved by avarice and
covetousness they fail to do so, or if, instead of rewarding, they
wrong and disgrace him, they commit an error which is not only without
excuse, but brings with it undying infamy. And, in fact, we find many
princes who have sinned in this way, for the cause given by Cornelius
Tacitus when he says, that “_men are readier to pay back injuries than
benefits, since to requite a benefit is felt to be a burthen, to return
an injury a gain_.”[3]

 [3] Proclivius est injuriæ quam beneficio vicem exsolvere, quia gratia
 oneri, ultio in quastu habetur. _Tacit. Hist._ iv. 2.


When, however, reward is withheld, or, to speak more correctly, where
offence is given, not from avarice but from suspicion, the prince or
people may deserve some excuse; and we read of many instances of
ingratitude proceeding from this cause. For the captain who by his
valour has won new dominions for his prince, since while overcoming his
enemies, he at the same time covers himself with glory and enriches his
soldiers, must needs acquire such credit with his own followers, and
with the enemy, and also with the subjects of his prince, as cannot be
wholly agreeable to the master who sent him forth. And since men are by
nature ambitious as well as jealous, and none loves to set a limit to
his fortunes, the suspicion which at once lays hold of the prince when
he sees his captain victorious, is sure to be inflamed by some arrogant
act or word of the captain himself. So that the prince will be unable
to think of anything but how to secure himself; and to this end will
contrive how he may put his captain to death, or at any rate deprive
him of the credit he has gained with the army and among the people;
doing all he can to show that the victory was not won by his valour,
but by good fortune, or by the cowardice of the enemy, or by the skill
and prudence of those commanders who were with him at this or the other
battle.

After Vespasian, who was then in Judæa, had been proclaimed emperor by
his army, Antonius Primus, who commanded another army in Illyria,
adopted his cause, and marching into Italy against Vitellius who had
been proclaimed emperor in Rome, courageously defeated two armies under
that prince, and occupied Rome; so that Mutianus, who was sent thither
by Vespasian, found everything done to his hand, and all difficulties
surmounted by the valour of Antonius. But all the reward which Antonius
had for his pains, was, that Mutianus forthwith deprived him of his
command of the army, and by degrees diminished his authority in Rome
till none was left him. Thereupon Antonius went to join Vespasian, who
was still in Asia; by whom he was so coldly received and so little
considered, that in despair he put himself to death. And of cases like
this, history is full. Every man living at the present hour knows with
what zeal and courage Gonsalvo of Cordova, while conducting the war in
Naples against the French, conquered and subdued that kingdom for his
master Ferdinand of Aragon; and how his services were requited by
Ferdinand coming from Aragon to Naples, and first of all depriving him
of the command of the army, afterwards of the fortresses, and finally
carrying him back with him to Spain, where soon after he died in
disgrace.

This jealousy, then, is so natural to princes, that they cannot guard
themselves against it, nor show gratitude to those who serving under
their standard have gained great victories and made great conquests on
their behalf. And if it be impossible for princes to free their minds
from such suspicions, there is nothing strange or surprising that a
people should be unable to do so. For as a city living under free
institutions has two ends always before it, namely to acquire liberty
and to preserve it, it must of necessity be led by its excessive
passion for liberty to make mistakes in the pursuit of both these
objects. Of the mistakes it commits in the effort to acquire liberty, I
shall speak, hereafter, in the proper place. Of mistakes committed in
the endeavour to preserve liberty are to be noted, the injuring those
citizens who ought to be rewarded, and the suspecting those who should
be trusted. Now, although in a State which has grown corrupt these
errors occasion great evils, and commonly lead to a tyranny, as
happened in Rome when Cæsar took by force what ingratitude had denied
him, they are nevertheless the cause of much good in the republic which
has not been corrupted, since they prolong the duration of its free
institutions, and make men, through fear of punishment, better and less
ambitious. Of all peoples possessed of great power, the Romans, for the
reasons I have given, have undoubtedly been the least ungrateful, since
we have no other instance of their ingratitude to cite, save that of
Scipio. For both Coriolanus and Camillus were banished on account of
the wrongs which they inflicted on the commons; and though the former
was not forgiven because he constantly retained ill will against the
people, the latter was not only recalled, but for the rest of his life
honoured as a prince. But the ingratitude shown towards Scipio arose
from the suspicion wherewith the citizens came to regard him, which
they had not felt in the case of the others, and which was occasioned
by the greatness of the enemy whom he had overthrown, the fame he had
won by prevailing in so dangerous and protracted a war, the suddenness
of his victories, and, finally, the favour which his youth, together
with his prudence and his other memorable qualities had gained for him.
These qualities were, in truth, so remarkable that the very
magistrates, not to speak of others, stood in awe of his authority, a
circumstance displeasing to prudent citizens, as before unheard of in
Rome. In short, his whole bearing and character were so much out of the
common, that even the elder Cato, so celebrated for his austere virtue,
was the first to declare against him, saying that no city could be
deemed free which contained a citizen who was feared by the
magistrates. And since, in this instance, the Romans followed the
opinion of Cato, they merit that excuse which, as I have said already,
should be extended to the prince or people who are ungrateful through
suspicion.

In conclusion it is to be said that while this vice of ingratitude has
its origin either in avarice or in suspicion, commonwealths are rarely
led into it by avarice, and far seldomer than princes by suspicion,
having, as shall presently be shown, far less reason than princes for
suspecting.




CHAPTER XXX.—_How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of
Ingratitude; and how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by
it._


That he may not be tormented by suspicion, nor show ungrateful, a
prince should go himself on his wars as the Roman emperors did at
first, as the Turk does now, and, in short, as all valiant princes have
done and do. For when it is the prince himself who conquers, the glory
and the gain are all his own; but when he is absent, since the glory is
another’s, it will seem to the prince that he profits nothing by the
gain, unless that glory be quenched which he knew not how to win for
himself; and when he thus becomes ungrateful and unjust, doubtless his
loss is greater than his gain. To the prince, therefore, who, either
through indolence or from want of foresight, sends forth a captain to
conduct his wars while he himself remains inactive at home, I have no
advice to offer which he does not already know. But I would counsel the
captain whom he sends, since I am sure that he can never escape the
attacks of ingratitude, to follow one or other of two courses, and
either quit his command at once after a victory, and place himself in
the hands of his prince, while carefully abstaining from every
vainglorious or ambitious act, so that the prince, being relieved from
all suspicion, may be disposed to reward, or at any rate not to injure
him; or else, should he think it inexpedient for him to act in this
way, to take boldly the contrary course, and fearlessly to follow out
all such measures as he thinks will secure for himself, and not for his
prince, whatever he has gained; conciliating the good-will of his
soldiers and fellow-citizens, forming new friendships with neighbouring
potentates, placing his own adherents in fortified towns, corrupting
the chief officers of his army and getting rid of those whom he fails
to corrupt, and by all similar means endeavouring to punish his master
for the ingratitude which he looks for at his hands. These are the only
two courses open; but since, as I said before, men know not how to be
wholly good or wholly bad, it will never happen that after a victory a
captain will quit his army and conduct himself modestly, nor yet that
he will venture to use those hardy methods which have in them some
strain of greatness; and so, remaining undecided, he will be crushed
while he still wavers and doubts.

A commonwealth desiring to avoid the vice of ingratitude is, as
compared with a prince, at this disadvantage, that while a prince can
go himself on his expeditions, the commonwealth must send some one of
its citizens. As a remedy, I would recommend that course being adopted
which was followed by the Roman republic in order to be less ungrateful
than others, having its origin in the nature of the Roman government.
For the whole city, nobles and commons alike, taking part in her wars,
there were always found in Rome at every stage of her history, so many
valiant and successful soldiers, that by reason of their number, and
from one acting as a check upon another, the nation had never ground to
be jealous of any one man among them; while they, on their part, lived
uprightly, and were careful to betray no sign of ambition, nor give the
people the least cause to distrust them as ambitious; so that he
obtained most glory from his dictatorship who was first to lay it down.
Which conduct, as it excited no suspicion, could occasion no
ingratitude.

We see, then, that the commonwealth which would have no cause to be
ungrateful, must act as Rome did; and that the citizen who would escape
ingratitude, must observe those precautions which were observed by
Roman citizens.




CHAPTER XXXI.—_That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme
severity for Misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely
through their Ignorance or Want of Judgment, were not punished at all_.


The Romans were not only, as has been said above, less ungrateful than
other republics, but were also more lenient and more considerate than
others in punishing the captains of their armies. For if these erred of
set purpose, they chastised them with gentleness; while if they erred
through ignorance, so far from punishing, they even honoured and
rewarded them. And this conduct was well considered. For as they judged
it of the utmost moment, that those in command of their armies should,
in all they had to do, have their minds undisturbed and free from
external anxieties, they would not add further difficulty and danger to
a task in itself both dangerous and difficult, lest none should ever be
found to act with valour. For supposing them to be sending forth an
army against Philip of Macedon in Greece or against Hannibal in Italy,
or against any other enemy at whose hands they had already sustained
reverses, the captain in command of that expedition would be weighted
with all the grave and important cares which attend such enterprises.
But if to all these cares, had been added the example of Roman generals
crucified or otherwise put to death for having lost battles, it would
have been impossible for a commander surrounded by so many causes for
anxiety to have acted with vigour and decision. For which reason, and
because they thought that to such persons the mere ignominy of defeat
was in itself punishment enough, they would not dishearten their
generals by inflicting on them any heavier penalty.

Of errors committed not through ignorance, the following is an
instance. Sergius and Virginius were engaged in the siege of Veii, each
being in command of a division of the army, and while Sergius was set
to guard against the approach of the Etruscans, it fell to Virginius to
watch the town. But Sergius being attacked by the Faliscans and other
tribes, chose rather to be defeated and routed than ask aid from
Virginius, who, on his part, awaiting the humiliation of his rival, was
willing to see his country dishonoured and an army destroyed, sooner
than go unasked to his relief. This was notable misconduct, and likely,
unless both offenders were punished, to bring discredit on the Roman
name. But whereas another republic would have punished these men with
death, the Romans were content to inflict only a money fine: not
because the offence did not in itself deserve severe handling, but
because they were unwilling, for the reasons already given, to depart
in this instance from their ancient practice.

Of errors committed through ignorance we have no better example than in
the case of Varro, through whose rashness the Romans were defeated by
Hannibal at Cannæ, where the republic well-nigh lost its liberty. But
because he had acted through ignorance and with no evil design, they
not only refrained from punishing him, but even treated him with
distinction; the whole senate going forth to meet him on his return to
Rome, and as they could not thank him for having fought, thanking him
for having come back, and for not having despaired of the fortunes his
country.

Again, when Papirius Cursor would have had Fabius put to death,
because, contrary to his orders, he had fought with the Samnites, among
the reasons pleaded by the father of Fabius against the persistency of
the dictator, he urged that never on the occasion of the defeat of any
of their captains had the Romans done what Papirius desired them to do
on the occasion of a victory.




CHAPTER XXXII.—_That a Prince or Commonwealth should not delay
conferring Benefits until they are themselves in difficulties._


The Romans found it for their advantage to be generous to the commons
at a season of danger, when Porsenna came to attack Rome and restore
the Tarquins. For the senate, apprehending that the people might choose
rather to take back their kings than to support a war, secured their
adherence by relieving them of the duty on salt and of all their other
burthens; saying that “_the poor did enough for the common welfare in
rearing their offspring._” In return for which indulgence the commons
were content to undergo war, siege, and famine. Let no one however,
relying on this example, delay conciliating the people till danger has
actually come; or, if he do, let him not hope to have the same good
fortune as the Romans. For the mass of the people will consider that
they have to thank not him, but his enemies, and that there is ground
to fear that when the danger has passed away, he will take back what he
gave under compulsion, and, therefore, that to him they lie under no
obligation. And the reason why the course followed by the Romans
succeeded, was that the State was still new and unsettled. Besides
which, the people knew that laws had already been passed in their
favour, as, for instance, the law allowing an appeal to the tribunes,
and could therefore persuade themselves that the benefits granted them
proceeded from the good-will entertained towards them by the senate,
and were not due merely to the approach of an enemy. Moreover, the
memory of their kings, by whom they had in many ways been wronged and
ill-treated, was still fresh in their minds. But since like conditions
seldom recur, it can only rarely happen that like remedies are useful.
Wherefore, all, whether princes or republics, who hold the reins of
government, ought to think beforehand of the adverse times which may
await them, and of what help they may then stand in need; and ought so
to live with their people as they would think right were they suffering
under any calamity. And, whosoever, whether prince or republic, but
prince more especially, behaves otherwise, and believes that after the
event and when danger is upon him he will be able to win men over by
benefits, deceives himself, and will not merely fail to maintain his
place, but will even precipitate his downfall.




CHAPTER XXXIII.—_When a Mischief has grown up in, or against a State,
it is safer to temporize with than to meet it with Violence_.


As Rome grew in fame, power, and dominion, her neighbours, who at first
had taken no heed to the injury which this new republic might do them,
began too late to see their mistake, and desiring to remedy what should
have been remedied before, combined against her to the number of forty
nations. Whereupon the Romans, resorting to a method usual with them in
seasons of peril, appointed a dictator; that is, gave power to one man
to decide without advice, and carry out his resolves without appeal.
Which expedient, as it then enabled them to overcome the dangers by
which they were threatened, so always afterwards proved most
serviceable, when, at any time during the growth of their power,
difficulties arose to embarrass their republic.

In connection with this league against Rome we have first to note, that
when a mischief which springs up either in or against a republic, and
whether occasioned by internal or external causes, has grown to such
proportions that it begins to fill the whole community with alarm, it
is a far safer course to temporize with it than to attempt to quell it
by violence. For commonly those who make this attempt only add fuel to
the flame, and hasten the impending ruin. Such disorders arise in a
republic more often from internal causes than external, either through
some citizen being suffered to acquire undue influence, or from the
corruption of some institution of that republic, which had once been
the life and sinew of its freedom; and from this corruption being
allowed to gain such head that the attempt to check it is more
dangerous than to let it be. And it is all the harder to recognize
these disorders in their beginning, because it seems natural to men to
look with favour on the beginnings of things. Favour of this sort, more
than by anything else, is attracted by those actions which seem to have
in them a quality of greatness, or which are performed by the young.
For when in a republic some young man is seen to come forward endowed
with rare excellence, the eyes of all the citizens are at once turned
upon him, and all, without distinction, concur to do him honour; so
that if he have one spark of ambition, the advantages which he has from
nature, together with those he takes from this favourable disposition
of men’s minds, raise him to such a pitch of power, that when the
citizens at last see their mistake it is almost impossible for them to
correct it; and when they do what they can to oppose his influence the
only result is to extend it. Of this I might cite numerous examples,
but shall content myself with one relating to our own city.

Cosimo de’ Medici, to whom the house of the Medici in Florence owes the
origin of its fortunes, acquired so great a name from the favour
wherewith his own prudence and the blindness of others invested him,
that coming to be held in awe by the government, his fellow-citizens
deemed it dangerous to offend him, but still more dangerous to let him
alone. Nicolò da Uzzano, his cotemporary, who was accounted well versed
in all civil affairs, but who had made a first mistake in not
discerning the dangers which might grow from the rising influence of
Cosimo, would never while he lived, permit a second mistake to be made
in attempting to crush him; judging that such an attempt would be the
ruin of the State, as in truth it proved after his death. For some who
survived him, disregarding his counsels, combined against Cosimo and
banished him from Florence. And so it came about that the partisans of
Cosimo, angry at the wrong done him, soon afterwards recalled him and
made him prince of the republic, a dignity he never would have reached
but for this open opposition. The very same thing happened in Rome in
the case of Cæsar. For his services having gained him the good-will of
Pompey and other citizens, their favour was presently turned to fear,
as Cicero testifies where he says that “it was late that Pompey began
to fear Cæsar.” This fear led men to think of remedies, and the
remedies to which they resorted accelerated the destruction of the
republic.

I say, then, that since it is difficult to recognize these disorders in
their beginning, because of the false impressions which things produce
at the first, it is a wiser course when they become known, to temporize
with them than to oppose them; for when you temporize, either they die
out of themselves, or at any rate the injury they do is deferred. And
the prince who would suppress such disorders or oppose himself to their
force and onset, must always be on his guard, lest he help where he
would hinder, retard when he would advance, and drown the plant he
thinks to water. He must therefore study well the symptoms of the
disease; and, if he believe himself equal to the cure, grapple with it
fearlessly; if not, he must let it be, and not attempt to treat it in
any way. For, otherwise, it will fare with him as it fared with those
neighbours of Rome, for whom it would have been safer, after that city
had grown to be so great, to have sought to soothe and restrain her by
peaceful arts, than to provoke her by open war to contrive new means of
attack and new methods of defence. For this league had no other effect
than to make the Romans more united and resolute than before, and to
bethink themselves of new expedients whereby their power was still more
rapidly advanced; among which was the creation of a dictator; for this
innovation not only enabled them to surmount the dangers which then
threatened them, but was afterwards the means of escaping infinite
calamities into which, without it, the republic must have fallen.




CHAPTER XXXIV.—_That the authority of the Dictator did good and not
harm to the Roman Republic: and that it is not those Powers which are
given by the free suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious
Citizens usurp for themselves, that are pernicious to a State._


Those citizens who first devised a dictatorship for Rome have been
blamed by certain writers, as though this had been the cause of the
tyranny afterwards established there. For these authors allege that the
first tyrant of Rome governed it with the title of Dictator, and that,
but for the existence of the office, Cæsar could never have cloaked his
usurpation under a constitutional name. He who first took up this
opinion had not well considered the matter, and his conclusion has been
accepted without good ground. For it was not the name nor office of
Dictator which brought Rome to servitude, but the influence which
certain of her citizens were able to assume from the prolongation of
their term of power; so that even had the name of Dictator been wanting
in Rome, some other had been found to serve their ends, since power may
readily give titles, but not titles power. We find, accordingly, that
while the dictatorship was conferred in conformity with public
ordinances, and not through personal influence, it was constantly
beneficial to the city. For it is the magistracies created and the
powers usurped in unconstitutional ways that hurt a republic, not those
which conform to ordinary rule; so that in Rome, through the whole
period of her history, we never find a dictator who acted otherwise
than well for the republic. For which there were the plainest reasons.
In the first place, to enable a citizen to work harm and to acquire
undue authority, many circumstances must be present which never can be
present in a State which is not corrupted. For such a citizen must be
exceedingly rich, and must have many retainers and partisans, whom he
cannot have where the laws are strictly observed, and who, if he had
them, would occasion so much alarm, that the free suffrage of the
people would seldom be in his favour. In the second place, the dictator
was not created for life, but for a fixed term, and only to meet the
emergency for which he was appointed. Power was indeed given him to
determine by himself what measures the exigency demanded; to do what he
had to do without consultation; and to punish without appeal. But he
had no authority to do anything to the prejudice of the State, as it
would have been to deprive the senate or the people of their
privileges, to subvert the ancient institutions of the city, or
introduce new. So that taking into account the brief time for which his
office lasted, its limited authority, and the circumstance that the
Roman people were still uncorrupted, it was impossible for him to
overstep the just limits of his power so as to injure the city; and in
fact we find that he was always useful to it.

And, in truth, among the institutions of Rome, this of the dictatorship
deserves our special admiration, and to be linked with the chief causes
of her greatness; for without some such safeguard a city can hardly
pass unharmed through extraordinary dangers. Because as the ordinary
institutions of a commonwealth work but slowly, no council and no
magistrate having authority to act in everything alone, but in most
matters one standing in need of the other, and time being required to
reconcile their differences, the remedies which they provide are most
dangerous when they have to be applied in cases which do not brook
delay. For which reason, every republic ought to have some resource of
this nature provided by its constitution; as we find that the Republic
of Venice, one of the best of those now existing, has in cases of
urgent danger reserved authority to a few of her citizens, if agreed
among themselves, to determine without further consultation what course
is to be followed. When a republic is not provided with some safeguard
such as this, either it must be ruined by observing constitutional
forms, or else, to save it, these must be broken through. But in a
republic nothing should be left to be effected by irregular methods,
because, although for the time the irregularity may be useful, the
example will nevertheless be pernicious, as giving rise to a practice
of violating the laws for good ends, under colour of which they may
afterwards be violated for ends which are not good. For which reason,
that can never become a perfect republic wherein every contingency has
not been foreseen and provided for by the laws, and the method of
dealing with it defined. To sum up, therefore, I say that those
republics which cannot in sudden emergencies resort either to a
dictator or to some similar authority, will, when the danger is
serious, always be undone.

We may note, moreover, how prudently the Romans, in introducing this
new office, contrived the conditions under which it was to be
exercised. For perceiving that the appointment of a dictator involved
something of humiliation for the consuls, who, from being the heads of
the State, were reduced to render obedience like every one else, and
anticipating that this might give offence, they determined that the
power to appoint should rest with the consuls, thinking that when the
occasion came when Rome should have need of this regal authority, they
would have the consuls acting willingly and feeling the less aggrieved
from the appointment being in their own hands. For those wounds or
other injuries which a man inflicts upon himself by choice, and of his
own free will, pain him far less than those inflicted by another.
Nevertheless, in the later days of the republic the Romans were wont to
entrust this power to a consul instead of to a dictator, using the
formula, _Videat_ CONSUL _ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat_.

But to return to the matter in hand, I say briefly, that when the
neighbours of Rome sought to crush her, they led her to take measures
not merely for her readier defence, but such as enabled her to attack
them with a stronger force, with better skill, and with an undivided
command.




CHAPTER XXXV—_Why the Creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although
brought about by the free and open Suffrage of the Citizens, was
hurtful to the Liberties of that Republic_


The fact of those ten citizens who were chosen by the Roman people to
make laws for Rome, in time becoming her tyrants and depriving her of
her freedom, may seem contrary to what I have said above, namely that
it is the authority which is violently usurped, and not that conferred
by the free suffrages of the people which is injurious to a republic.
Here, however, we have to take into account both the mode in which, and
the term for which authority is given. Where authority is unrestricted
and is conferred for a long term, meaning by that for a year or more,
it is always attended with danger, and its results will be good or bad
according as the men are good or bad to whom it is committed. Now when
we compare the authority of the Ten with that possessed by the
dictator, we see that the power placed in the hands of the former was
out of all proportion greater than that entrusted to the latter. For
when a dictator was appointed there still remained the tribunes, the
consuls, and the senate, all of them invested with authority of which
the dictator could not deprive them. For even if he could have taken
his consulship from one man, or his status as a senator from another,
he could not abolish the senatorial rank nor pass new laws. So that the
senate, the consuls, and the tribunes continuing to exist with
undiminished authority were a check upon him and kept him in the right
road. But on the creation of the Ten, the opposite of all this took
place. For on their appointment, consuls and tribunes were swept away,
and express powers were given to the new magistrates to make laws and
do whatever else they thought fit, with the entire authority of the
whole Roman people. So that finding themselves alone without consuls or
tribunes to control them, and with no appeal against them to the
people, and thus there being none to keep a watch upon them, and
further being stimulated by the ambition of Appius, in the second year
of their office they began to wax insolent.

Let it be noted, therefore, that when it is said that authority given
by the public vote is never hurtful to any commonwealth, it is assumed
that the people will never be led to confer that authority without due
limitations, or for other than a reasonable term. Should they, however
either from being deceived or otherwise blinded, be induced to bestow
authority imprudently, as the Romans bestowed it on the Ten, it will
always fare with them as with the Romans. And this may readily be
understood on reflecting what causes operated to keep the dictator
good, what to make the Ten bad, and by observing how those republics
which have been accounted well governed, have acted when conferring
authority for an extended period, as the Spartans on their kings and
the Venetians on their doges; for it will be seen that in both these
instances the authority was controlled by checks which made it
impossible for it to be abused. But where an uncontrolled authority is
given, no security is afforded by the circumstance that the body of the
people is not corrupted; for in the briefest possible time absolute
authority will make a people corrupt, and obtain for itself friends and
partisans. Nor will it be any hindrance to him in whom such authority
is vested, that he is poor and without connections, for wealth and
every other advantage will quickly follow, as shall be shown more fully
when we discuss the appointment of the Ten.




CHAPTER XXXVI.—_That Citizens who have held the higher Offices of a
Commonwealth should not disdain the lower_.


Under the consuls M. Fabius and Cn. Manlius, the Romans had a memorable
victory in a battle fought with the Veientines and the Etruscans, in
which Q. Fabius, brother of the consul, who had himself been consul the
year before, was slain. This event may lead us to remark how well the
methods followed by the city of Rome were suited to increase her power,
and how great a mistake is made by other republics in departing from
them. For, eager as the Romans were in the pursuit of glory, they never
esteemed it a dishonour to obey one whom before they had commanded, or
to find themselves serving in the ranks of an army which once they had
led. This usage, however, is opposed to the ideas, the rules, and the
practice which prevail at the present day, as, for instance, in Venice,
where the notion still obtains that a citizen who has filled a great
office should be ashamed to accept a less; and where the State itself
permits him to decline it. This course, assuming it to lend lustre to
individual citizens, is plainly to the disadvantage of the community,
which has reason to hope more from, and to trust more to, the citizen
who descends from a high office to fill a lower, than him who rises
from a low office to fill a high one; for in the latter no confidence
can reasonably be placed, unless he be seen to have others about him of
such credit and worth that it may be hoped their wise counsels and
influence will correct his inexperience. But had the usage which
prevails in Venice and in other modern commonwealths and kingdoms,
prevailed in Rome whereby he who had once been consul was never
afterwards to go with the army except as consul, numberless results
must have followed detrimental to the free institutions of that city;
as well from the mistakes which the inexperience of new men would have
occasioned, as because from their ambition having a freer course, and
from their having none near them in whose presence they might fear to
do amiss, they would have grown less scrupulous; and in this way the
public service must have suffered grave harm.




CHAPTER XXXVII.—_Of the Mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and
how it is a great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a Law
opposed to ancient Usage and with stringent retrospective Effect._


It has been said by ancient writers that to be pinched by adversity or
pampered by prosperity is the common lot of men, and that in whichever
way they are acted upon the result is the same. For when no longer
urged to war on one another by necessity, they are urged by ambition,
which has such dominion in their hearts that it never leaves them to
whatsoever heights they climb. For nature has so ordered it that while
they desire everything, it is impossible for them to have everything,
and thus their desires being always in excess of their capacity to
gratify them, they remain constantly dissatisfied and discontented. And
hence the vicissitudes in human affairs. For some seeking to enlarge
their possessions, and some to keep what they have got, wars and
enmities ensue, from which result the ruin of one country and the
growth of another.

I am led to these reflections from observing that the commons of Rome
were not content to secure themselves against the nobles by the
creation of tribunes, a measure to which they were driven by necessity,
but after effecting this, forthwith entered upon an ambitious contest
with the nobles, seeking to share with them what all men most esteem,
namely, their honours and their wealth. Hence was bred that disorder
from which sprang the feuds relating to the Agrarian Laws, and which
led in the end to the downfall of the Roman republic. And although it
should be the object of every well-governed commonwealth to make the
State rich and keep individual citizens poor it must be allowed that in
the matter of this law the city of Rome was to blame; whether for
having passed it at first in such a shape as to require it to be
continually recast; or for having postponed it so long that its
retrospective effect was the occasion of tumult; or else, because,
although rightly framed at first, it had come in its operation to be
perverted. But in whatever way it happened, so it was, that this law
was never spoken of in Rome without the whole city being convulsed.

The law itself embraced two principal provisions. By one it was enacted
that no citizen should possess more than a fixed number of acres of
land; by the other that all lands taken from the enemy should be
distributed among the whole people. A twofold blow was thus aimed at
the nobles; since all who possessed more land than the law allowed, as
most of the nobles did, fell to be deprived of it; while by dividing
the lands of the enemy among the whole people, the road to wealth was
closed. These two grounds of offence being given to a powerful class,
to whom it appeared that by resisting the law they did a service to the
State, the whole city, as I have said, was thrown into an uproar on the
mere mention of its name. The nobles indeed sought to temporize, and to
prevail by patience and address; sometimes calling out the army,
sometimes opposing another tribune to the one who was promoting the
law, and sometimes coming to a compromise by sending a colony into the
lands which were to be divided; as was done in the case of the
territory of Antium, whither, on a dispute concerning the law having
arisen, settlers were sent from Rome, and the land made over to them.
In speaking of which colony Titus Livius makes the notable remark, that
hardly any one in Rome could be got to take part in it, so much readier
were the commons to indulge in covetous schemes at home, than to
realize them by leaving it.

The ill humour engendered by this contest continued to prevail until
the Romans began to carry their arms into the remoter parts of Italy
and to countries beyond its shores; after which it seemed for a time to
slumber—and this, because the lands held by the enemies of Rome, out of
sight of her citizens and too remote to be conveniently cultivated,
came to be less desired. Whereupon the Romans grew less eager to punish
their enemies by dividing their lands, and were content, when they
deprived any city of its territory, to send colonists to occupy it. For
causes such as these, the measure remained in abeyance down to the time
of the Gracchi; but being by them revived, finally overthrew the
liberty of Rome. For as it found the power of its adversaries doubled,
such a flame of hatred was kindled between commons and senate, that,
regardless of all civil restraints, they resorted to arms and
bloodshed. And as the public magistrates were powerless to provide a
remedy, each of the two factions having no longer any hopes from them,
resolved to do what it could for itself, and to set up a chief for its
own protection. On reaching this stage of tumult and disorder, the
commons lent their influence to Marius, making him four times consul;
whose authority, lasting thus long, and with very brief intervals,
became so firmly rooted that he was able to make himself consul other
three times. Against this scourge, the nobles, lacking other defence,
set themselves to favour Sylla, and placing him at the head of their
faction, entered on the civil wars; wherein, after much blood had been
spilt, and after many changes of fortune, they got the better of their
adversaries. But afterwards, in the time of Cæsar and Pompey, the
distemper broke out afresh; for Cæsar heading the Marian party, and
Pompey, that of Sylla, and war ensuing, the victory remained with
Cæsar, who was the first tyrant in Rome; after whose time that city was
never again free. Such, therefore, was the beginning and such the end
of the Agrarian Law.

But since it has elsewhere been said that the struggle between the
commons and senate of Rome preserved her liberties, as giving rise to
laws favourable to freedom, it might seem that the consequences of the
Agrarian Law are opposed to that view. I am not, however, led to alter
my opinion on this account; for I maintain that the ambition of the
great is so pernicious that unless controlled and counteracted in a
variety of ways, it will always reduce a city to speedy ruin. So that
if the controversy over the Agrarian Laws took three hundred years to
bring Rome to slavery, she would in all likelihood have been brought to
slavery in a far shorter time, had not the commons, by means of this
law, and by other demands, constantly restrained the ambition of the
nobles.

We may also learn from this contest how much more men value wealth than
honours; for in the matter of honours, the Roman nobles always gave way
to the commons without any extraordinary resistance; but when it came
to be a question of property, so stubborn were they in its defence,
that the commons to effect their ends had to resort to those irregular
methods which have been described above. Of which irregularities the
prime movers were the Gracchi, whose motives are more to be commended
than their measures; since to pass a law with stringent retrospective
effect, in order to remove an abuse of long standing in a republic, is
an unwise step, and one which, as I have already shown at length, can
have no other result than to accelerate the mischief to which the abuse
leads; whereas, if you temporize, either the abuse develops more
slowly, or else, in course of time, and before it comes to a head, dies
out of itself.




CHAPTER XXXVIII.—_That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and
that the course they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice._


A terrible pestilence breaking out in Rome seemed to the Equians and
Volscians to offer a fit opportunity for crushing her. The two nations,
therefore, assembling a great army, attacked the Latins and Hernicians
and laid waste their country. Whereupon the Latins and Hernicians were
forced to make their case known to the Romans, and to ask to be
defended by them. The Romans, who were sorely afflicted by the
pestilence, answered that they must look to their own defence, and with
their own forces, since Rome was in no position to succour them.

Here we recognize the prudence and magnanimity of the Roman senate, and
how at all times, and in all changes of fortune, they assumed the
responsibility of determining the course their country should take; and
were not ashamed, when necessary, to decide on a course contrary to
that which was usual with them, or which they had decided to follow on
some other occasion. I say this because on other occasions this same
senate had forbidden these nations to defend themselves; and a less
prudent assembly might have thought it lowered their credit to withdraw
that prohibition. But the Roman senate always took a sound view of
things, and always accepted the least hurtful course as the best. So
that, although it was distasteful to them not to be able to defend
their subjects, and equally distasteful—both for the reasons given, and
for others which may be understood—that their subjects should take up
arms in their absence, nevertheless knowing that these must have
recourse to arms in any case, since the enemy was upon them, they took
an honourable course in deciding that what had to be done should be
done with their leave, lest men driven to disobey by necessity should
come afterwards to disobey from choice. And although this may seem the
course which every republic ought reasonably to follow, nevertheless
weak and badly-advised republics cannot make up their minds to follow
it, not knowing how to do themselves honour in like extremities.

After Duke Valentino had taken Faenza and forced Bologna to yield to
his terms, desiring to return to Rome through Tuscany, he sent one of
his people to Florence to ask leave for himself and his army to pass. A
council was held in Florence to consider how this request should be
dealt with, but no one was favourable to the leave asked for being
granted. Wherein the Roman method was not followed. For as the Duke had
a very strong force with him, while the Florentines were so bare of
troops that they could not have prevented his passage, it would have
been far more for their credit that he should seem to pass with their
consent, than that he should pass in spite of them; because, while
discredit had to be incurred either way, they would have incurred less
by acceding to his demand.

But of all courses the worst for a weak State is to be irresolute; for
then whatever it does will seem to be done under compulsion, so that if
by chance it should do anything well, this will be set down to
necessity and not to prudence. Of this I shall cite two other instances
happening in our own times, and in our own country. In the year 1500,
King Louis of France, after recovering Milan, being desirous to restore
Pisa to the Florentines, so as to obtain payment from them of the fifty
thousand ducats which they had promised him on the restitution being
completed, sent troops to Pisa under M. Beaumont, in whom, though a
Frenchman, the Florentines put much trust. Beaumont accordingly took up
his position with his forces between Cascina and Pisa, to be in
readiness to attack the town. After he had been there for some days
making arrangements for the assault, envoys came to him from Pisa
offering to surrender their city to the French if a promise were given
in the king’s name, not to hand it over to the Florentines until four
months had run. This condition was absolutely rejected by the
Florentines, and the siege being proceeded with, they were forced to
retire with disgrace. Now the proposal of the Pisans was rejected by
the Florentines for no other reason than that they distrusted the good
faith of the King, into whose hands their weakness obliged them to
commit themselves, and did not reflect how much more it was for their
interest that, by obtaining entrance into Pisa, he should have it in
his power to restore the town to them, or, failing to restore it,
should at once disclose his designs, than that remaining outside he
should put them off with promises for which they had to pay. It would
therefore have been a far better course for the Florentines to have
agreed to Beaumont taking possession on whatever terms.

This was seen afterwards by experience in the year 1502, when, on the
revolt of Arezzo, M. Imbalt was sent by the King of France with French
troops to assist the Florentines. For when he got near Arezzo, and
began to negotiate with the Aretines, who, like the Pisans, were
willing to surrender their town on terms, the acceptance of these terms
was strongly disapproved in Florence; which Imbalt learning, and
thinking that the Florentines were acting with little sense, he took
the entire settlement of conditions into his own hands, and, without
consulting the Florentine commissioners, concluded an arrangement to
his own satisfaction, in execution of which he entered Arezzo with his
army. And he let the Florentines know that he thought them fools and
ignorant of the ways of the world; since if they desired to have
Arezzo, they could signify their wishes to the King, who would be much
better able to give it them when he had his soldiers inside, than when
he had them outside the town. Nevertheless, in Florence they never
ceased to blame and abuse M. Imbalt, until at last they came to see
that if Beaumont had acted in the same way, they would have got
possession Of Pisa as well as of Arezzo.

Applying what has been said to the matter in hand, we find that
irresolute republics, unless upon compulsion, never follow wise
courses; for wherever there is room for doubt, their weakness will not
suffer them to come to any resolve; so that unless their doubts be
overcome by some superior force which impels them forward, they remain
always in suspense.




CHAPTER XXXIX.—_That often the same Accidents are seen to befall
different Nations._


Any one comparing the present with the past will soon perceive that in
all cities and in all nations there prevail the same desires and
passions as always have prevailed; for which reason it should be an
easy matter for him who carefully examines past events, to foresee
those which are about to happen in any republic, and to apply such
remedies as the ancients have used in like cases; or finding none which
have been used by them, to strike out new ones, such as they might have
used in similar circumstances. But these lessons being neglected or not
understood by readers, or, if understood by them, being unknown to
rulers, it follows that the same disorders are common to all times.

In the year 1494 the Republic of Florence, having lost a portion of its
territories, including Pisa and other towns, was forced to make war
against those who had taken possession of them, who being powerful, it
followed that great sums were spent on these wars to little purpose.
This large expenditure had to be met by heavy taxes which gave occasion
to numberless complaints on the part of the people; and inasmuch as the
war was conducted by a council of ten citizens, who were styled “the
Ten of the War,” the multitude began to regard these with displeasure,
as though they were the cause of the war and of the consequent
expenditure; and at last persuaded themselves that if they got rid of
this magistracy there would be an end to the war. Wherefore when the
magistracy of “the Ten” should have been renewed, the people did not
renew it, but, suffering it to lapse, entrusted their affairs to the
“Signory.” This course was most pernicious, since not only did it fail
to put an end to the war, as the people expected it would, but by
setting aside men who had conducted it with prudence, led to such
mishaps that not Pisa only, but Arezzo also, and many other towns
besides were lost to Florence. Whereupon, the people recognizing their
mistake, and that the evil was in the disease and not in the physician,
reinstated the magistracy of the Ten.

Similar dissatisfaction grew up in Rome against the consular authority.
For the people seeing one war follow another, and that they were never
allowed to rest, when they should have ascribed this to the ambition of
neighbouring nations who desired their overthrow, ascribed it to the
ambition of the nobles, who, as they believed, being unable to wreak
their hatred against them within the city, where they were protected by
the power of the tribunes, sought to lead them outside the city, where
they were under the authority of the consuls, that they might crush
them where they were without help. In which belief they thought it
necessary either to get rid of the consuls altogether, or so to
restrict their powers as to leave them no authority over the people,
either in the city or out of it.

The first who attempted to pass a law to this effect was the tribune
Terentillus, who proposed that a committee of five should be named to
consider and regulate the power of the consuls. This roused the anger
of the nobles, to whom it seemed that the greatness of their authority
was about to set for ever, and that no part would be left them in the
administration of the republic. Such, however, was the obstinacy of the
tribunes, that they succeeded in abolishing the consular title, nor
were satisfied until, after other changes, it was resolved that, in
room of consuls, tribunes should be appointed with consular powers; so
much greater was their hatred of the name than of the thing. For a long
time matters remained on this footing; till eventually, the commons,
discovering their mistake, resumed the appointment of consuls in the
same way as the Florentines reverted to “the Ten of the War.”




CHAPTER XL.—_Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what
therein is to be noted. Wherein among other Matters is shown how the
same Causes may lead to the Safety or to the Ruin of a Commonwealth._


It being my desire to treat fully of those disorders which arose in
Rome on the creation of the decemvirate, I think it not amiss first of
all to relate what took place at the time of that creation, and then to
discuss those circumstances attending it which seem most to deserve
notice. These are numerous, and should be well considered, both by
those who would maintain the liberties of a commonwealth and by those
who would subvert them. For in the course of our inquiry it will be
seen that many mistakes prejudicial to freedom were made by the senate
and people, and that many were likewise made by Appius, the chief
decemvir, prejudicial to that tyranny which it was his aim to establish
in Rome.

After much controversy and wrangling between the commons and the nobles
as to the framing of new laws by which the freedom of Rome might be
better secured, Spurius Posthumius and two other citizens were, by
general consent, despatched to Athens to procure copies of the laws
which Solon had drawn up for the Athenians, to the end that these might
serve as a groundwork for the laws of Rome. On their return, the next
step was to depute certain persons to examine these laws and to draft
the new code. For which purpose a commission consisting of ten members,
among whom was Appius Claudius, a crafty and ambitious citizen, was
appointed for a year; and that the commissioners in framing their laws
might act without fear or favour, all the other magistracies, and in
particular the consulate and tribuneship, were suspended, and the
appeal to the people discontinued; so that the decemvirs came to be
absolute in Rome. Very soon the whole authority of the commissioners
came to be centred in Appius, owing to the favour in which he was held
by the commons. For although before he had been regarded as the cruel
persecutor of the people, he now showed himself so conciliatory in his
bearing that men wondered at the sudden change in his character and
disposition.

This set of commissioners, then, behaved discreetly, being attended by
no more than twelve lictors, walking in front of that decemvir whom the
rest put forward as their chief; and though vested with absolute
authority, yet when a Roman citizen had to be tried for murder, they
cited him before the people and caused him to be judged by them. Their
laws they wrote upon ten tables, but before signing them they exposed
them publicly, that every one might read and consider them, and if any
defect were discovered in them, it might be corrected before they were
finally passed. At this juncture Appius caused it to be notified
throughout the city that were two other tables added to these ten, the
laws would be complete; hoping that under this belief the people would
consent to continue the decemvirate for another year. This consent the
people willingly gave, partly to prevent the consuls being reinstated,
and partly because they thought they could hold their ground without
the aid of the tribunes, who, as has already been said, were the judges
in criminal cases.

On it being resolved to reappoint the decemvirate, all the nobles set
to canvass for the office, Appius among the foremost; and such
cordiality did he display towards the commons while seeking their
votes, that the other candidates, “_unable to persuade themselves that
so much affability on the part of so proud a man was wholly
disinterested,_” began to suspect him; but fearing to oppose him
openly, sought to circumvent him, by putting him forward, though the
youngest of them all, to declare to the people the names of the
proposed decemvirs; thinking that he would not venture to name himself,
that being an unusual course in Rome, and held discreditable. “_But
what they meant as a hindrance, he turned to account,_” by proposing,
to the surprise and displeasure of the whole nobility, his own name
first, and then nominating nine others on whose support he thought he
could depend.

The new appointments, which were to last for a year, having been made,
Appius soon let both commons and nobles know the mistake they had
committed, for throwing off the mask, he allowed his innate arrogance
to appear, and speedily infected his colleagues with the same spirit;
who, to overawe the people and the senate, instead of twelve lictors,
appointed one hundred and twenty. For a time their measures were
directed against high and low alike; but presently they began to
intrigue with the senate, and to attack the commons; and if any of the
latter, on being harshly used by one decemvir, ventured to appeal to
another, he was worse handled on the appeal than in the first instance.
The commons, on discovering their error, began in their despair to turn
their eyes towards the nobles, “_and to look for a breeze of freedom
from that very quarter whence fearing slavery they had brought the
republic to its present straits._” To the nobles the sufferings of the
commons were not displeasing, from the hope “_that disgusted with the
existing state of affairs, they too might come to desire the
restoration of the consuls._”

When the year for which the decemvirs were appointed at last came to an
end, the two additional tables of the law were ready, but had not yet
been published. This was made a pretext by them for prolonging their
magistracy, which they took measures to retain by force, gathering
round them for this purpose a retinue of young noblemen, whom they
enriched with the goods of those citizens whom they had condemned.
“_Corrupted by which gifts, these youths came to prefer selfish licence
to public freedom._”

It happened that at this time the Sabines and Volscians began to stir
up a war against Rome, and it was during the alarm thereby occasioned
that the decemvirs were first made aware how weak was their position.
For without the senate they could take no warlike measures, while by
assembling the senate they seemed to put an end to their own authority.
Nevertheless, being driven to it by necessity, they took this latter
course. When the senate met, many of the senators, but particularly
Valerius and Horatius, inveighed against the insolence of the
decemvirs, whose power would forthwith have been cut short, had not the
senate through jealousy of the commons declined to exercise their
authority. For they thought that were the decemvirs to lay down office
of their own free will, tribunes might not be reappointed. Wherefore
they decided for war, and sent forth the armies under command of
certain of the decemvirs. But Appius remaining behind to govern the
city, it so fell out that he became enamoured of Virginia, and that
when he sought to lay violent hands upon her, Virginius, her father, to
save her from dishonour, slew her. Thereupon followed tumults in Rome,
and mutiny among the soldiers, who, making common cause with the rest
of the plebeians, betook themselves to the Sacred Hill, and there
remained until the decemvirs laid down their office; when tribunes and
consuls being once more appointed, Rome was restored to her ancient
freedom.

In these events we note, first of all, that the pernicious step of
creating this tyranny in Rome was due to the same causes which commonly
give rise to tyrannies in cities; namely, the excessive love of the
people for liberty, and the passionate eagerness of the nobles to
govern. For when they cannot agree to pass some measure favourable to
freedom, one faction or the other sets itself to support some one man,
and a tyranny at once springs up. Both parties in Rome consented to the
creation of the decemvirs, and to their exercising unrestricted powers,
from the desire which the one had to put an end to the consular name,
and the other to abolish the authority of the tribunes. When, on the
appointment of the decemvirate, it seemed to the commons that Appius
had become favourable to their cause, and was ready to attack the
nobles, they inclined to support him. But when a people is led to
commit this error of lending its support to some one man, in order that
he may attack those whom it holds in hatred, if he only be prudent he
will inevitably become the tyrant of that city. For he will wait until,
with the support of the people, he can deal a fatal blow to the nobles,
and will never set himself to oppress the people until the nobles have
been rooted out. But when that time comes, the people, although they
recognize their servitude, will have none to whom they can turn for
help.

Had this method, which has been followed by all who have successfully
established tyrannies in republics, been followed by Appius, his power
would have been more stable and lasting; whereas, taking the directly
opposite course, he could not have acted more unwisely than he did. For
in his eagerness to grasp the tyranny, he made himself obnoxious to
those who were in fact conferring it, and who could have maintained him
in it; and he destroyed those who were his friends, while he sought
friendship from those from whom he could not have it. For although it
be the desire of the nobles to tyrannize, that section of them which
finds itself outside the tyranny is always hostile to the tyrant, who
can never succeed in gaining over the entire body of the nobles by
reason of their greed and ambition; for no tyrant can ever have honours
or wealth enough to satisfy them all.

In abandoning the people, therefore, and siding with the nobles, Appius
committed a manifest mistake, as well for the reasons above given, as
because to hold a thing by force, he who uses force must needs be
stronger than he against whom it is used. Whence it happens that those
tyrants who have the mass of the people for their friends and the
nobles for their enemies, are more secure than those who have the
people for their enemies and the nobles for their friends; because in
the former case their authority has the stronger support. For with such
support a ruler can maintain himself by the internal strength of his
State, as did Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, when attacked by the Romans and
by the whole of Greece; for making sure work with the nobles, who were
few in number, and having the people on his side, he was able with
their assistance to defend himself; which he could not have done had
they been against him. But in the case of a city, wherein the tyrant
has few friends, its internal strength will not avail him for its
defence, and he will have to seek aid from without in one of three
shapes. For either he must hire foreign guards to defend his person; or
he must arm the peasantry, so that they may play the part which ought
to be played by the citizens; or he must league with powerful
neighbours for his defence. He who follows these methods and observes
them well, may contrive to save himself, though he has the people for
his enemy. But Appius could not follow the plan of gaining over the
peasantry, since in Rome they and the people were one. And what he
might have done he knew not how to do, and so was ruined at the very
outset.

In creating the decemvirate, therefore, both the senate and the people
made grave mistakes. For although, as already explained, when speaking
of the dictatorship, it is those magistrates who make themselves, and
not those made by the votes of the people, that are hurtful to freedom;
nevertheless the people, in creating magistrates ought to take such
precautions as will make it difficult for these to become bad. But the
Romans when they ought to have set a check on the decemvirs in order to
keep them good, dispensed with it, making them the sole magistrates of
Rome, and setting aside all others; and this from the excessive desire
of the senate to get rid of the tribunes, and of the commons to get rid
of the consuls; by which objects both were so blinded as to fall into
all the disorders which ensued. For, as King Ferrando was wont to say,
men often behave like certain of the smaller birds, which are so intent
on the prey to which nature incites them, that they discern not the
eagle hovering overhead for their destruction.

In this Discourse then the mistakes made by the Roman people in their
efforts to preserve their freedom and the mistakes made by Appius in
his endeavour to obtain the tyranny, have, as I proposed at the outset,
been plainly shown.




CHAPTER XLI.—_That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to
severity, or to a haughty bearing from a humble._


Among the crafty devices used by Appius to aid him in maintaining his
authority, this, of suddenly passing from one character to the other
extreme, was of no small prejudice to him. For his fraud in pretending
to the commons to be well disposed towards them, was happily contrived;
as were also the means he took to bring about the reappointment of the
decemvirate. Most skilful, too, was his audacity in nominating himself
contrary to the expectation of the nobles, and in proposing colleagues
on whom he could depend to carry out his ends. But, as I have said
already, it was not happily contrived that, after doing all this, he
should suddenly turn round, and from being the friend, reveal himself
the enemy of the people; haughty instead of humane; cruel instead of
kindly; and make this change so rapidly as to leave himself no shadow
of excuse, but compel all to recognize the doubleness of his nature.
For he who has once seemed good, should he afterwards choose, for his
own ends, to become bad, ought to change by slow degrees, and as
opportunity serves; so that before his altered nature strip him of old
favour, he may have gained for himself an equal share of new, and thus
his influence suffer no diminution. For otherwise, being at once
unmasked and friendless, he is undone:




CHAPTER XLII.—_How easily Men become corrupted._


In this matter of the decemvirate we may likewise note the ease
wherewith men become corrupted, and how completely, although born good
and well brought up, they change their nature. For we see how
favourably disposed the youths whom Appius gathered round him became
towards his tyranny, in return for the trifling benefits which they
drew from it; and how Quintus Fabius, one of the second decemvirate and
a most worthy man, blinded by a little ambition, and misled by the evil
counsels of Appius, abandoning his fair fame, betook himself to most
unworthy courses, and grew like his master.

Careful consideration of this should make those who frame laws for
commonwealths and kingdoms more alive to the necessity of placing
restraints on men’s evil appetites, and depriving them of all hope of
doing wrong with impunity.




CHAPTER XLIII.—_That Men fighting in their own Cause make good and
resolute Soldiers._


From what has been touched upon above, we are also led to remark how
wide is the difference between an army which, having no ground for
discontent, fights in its own cause, and one which, being discontented,
fights to satisfy the ambition of others. For whereas the Romans were
always victorious under the consuls, under the decemvirs they were
always defeated. This helps us to understand why it is that mercenary
troops are worthless; namely, that they have no incitement to keep them
true to you beyond the pittance which you pay them, which neither is
nor can be a sufficient motive for such fidelity and devotion as would
make them willing to die in your behalf. But in those armies in which
there exists not such an attachment towards him for whom they fight as
makes them devoted to his cause, there never will be valour enough to
withstand an enemy if only he be a little brave. And since such
attachment and devotion cannot be looked for from any save your own
subjects, you must, if you would preserve your dominions, or maintain
your commonwealth or kingdom, arm the natives of your country; as we
see to have been done by all those who have achieved great things in
war.

Under the decemvirs the ancient valour of the Roman soldiers had in no
degree abated; yet, because they were no longer animated by the same
good will, they did not exert themselves as they were wont. But so soon
as the decemvirate came to an end, and the soldiers began once more to
fight as free men, the old spirit was reawakened, and, as a
consequence, their enterprises, according to former usage, were brought
to a successful close.




CHAPTER XLIV.—_That the Multitude is helpless without a Head: and that
we should not with the same breath threaten and ask leave._


When Virginia died by her father’s hand, the commons of Rome withdrew
under arms to the Sacred Hill. Whereupon the senate sent messengers to
demand by what sanction they had deserted their commanders and
assembled there in arms. And in such reverence was the authority of the
senate held, that the commons, lacking leaders, durst make no reply.
“Not,” says Titus Livius, “that they were at a loss what to answer, but
because they had none to answer for them;” words which clearly show how
helpless a thing is the multitude when without a head.

This defect was perceived by Virginius, at whose instance twenty
military tribunes were appointed by the commons to be their spokesmen
with the senate, and to negotiate terms; who, having asked that
Valerius and Horatius might be sent to them, to whom their wishes would
be made known, these declined to go until the decemvirs had laid down
their office. When this was done, and Valerius and Horatius came to the
hill where the commons were assembled, the latter demanded that
tribunes of the people should be appointed; that in future there should
be an appeal to the people from the magistrates of whatever degree; and
that all the decemvirs should be given up to them to be burned alive.
Valerius and Horatius approved the first two demands, but rejected the
last as inhuman; telling the commons that “they were rushing into that
very cruelty which they themselves had condemned in others;” and
counselling them to say nothing about the decemvirs, but to be
satisfied to regain their own power and authority; since thus the way
would be open to them for obtaining every redress.

Here we see plainly how foolish and unwise it is to ask a thing and
with the same breath to say, “I desire this that I may inflict an
injury.” For we should never declare our intention beforehand, but
watch for every opportunity to carry it out. So that it is enough to
ask another for his weapons, without adding, “With these I purpose to
destroy you;” for when once you have secured his weapons, you can use
them afterwards as you please.




CHAPTER XLV.—_That it is of evil example, especially in the Maker of a
Law, not to observe the Law when made: and that daily to renew acts of
injustice in a City is most hurtful to the Governor._


Terms having been adjusted, and the old order of things restored in
Rome, Virginius cited Appius to defend himself before the people; and
on his appearing attended by many of the nobles, ordered him to be led
to prison. Whereupon Appius began to cry out and appeal to the people.
But Virginius told him that he was unworthy to be allowed that appeal
which he had himself done away with, or to have that people whom he had
wronged for his protectors. Appius rejoined, that the people should not
set at nought that right of appeal which they themselves had insisted
on with so much zeal. Nevertheless, he was dragged to prison, and
before the day of trial slew himself. Now, though the wicked life of
Appius merited every punishment, still it was impolitic to violate the
laws, more particularly a law which had only just been passed; for
nothing, I think, is of worse example in a republic, than to make a law
and not to keep it; and most of all, when he who breaks is he that made
it.

After the year 1494, the city of Florence reformed its government with
the help of the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, whose writings declare his
learning, his wisdom, and the excellence of his heart. Among other
ordinances for the safety of the citizens, he caused a law to be
passed, allowing an appeal to the people from the sentences pronounced
by “the Eight” and by the “Signory” in trials for State offences; a law
he had long contended for, and carried at last with great difficulty.
It so happened that a very short time after it was passed, five
citizens were condemned to death by the “Signory” for State offences,
and that when they sought to appeal to the people they were not
permitted to do so, and the law was violated. This, more than any other
mischance, helped to lessen the credit of the Friar; since if his law
of appeal was salutary, he should have caused it to be observed; if
useless, he ought not to have promoted it. And his inconsistency was
the more remarked, because in all the sermons which he preached after
the law was broken, he never either blamed or excused the person who
had broken it, as though unwilling to condemn, while unable to justify
what suited his purposes. This, as betraying the ambitious and partial
turn of his mind, took from his reputation and exposed him to much
obloquy.

Another thing which greatly hurts a government is to keep alive bitter
feelings in men’s minds by often renewed attacks on individuals, as was
done in Rome after the decemvirate was put an end to. For each of the
decemvirs, and other citizens besides, were at different times accused
and condemned, so that the greatest alarm was spread through the whole
body of the nobles, who came to believe that these prosecutions would
never cease until their entire order was exterminated. And this must
have led to grave mischief had not Marcus Duilius the tribune provided
against it, by an edict which forbade every one, for the period of a
year, citing or accusing any Roman citizen, an ordinance which had the
effect of reassuring the whole nobility. Here we see how hurtful it is
for a prince or commonwealth to keep the minds of their subjects in
constant alarm and suspense by continually renewed punishments and
violence. And, in truth, no course can be more pernicious. For men who
are in fear for their safety will seize on every opportunity for
securing themselves against the dangers which surround them, and will
grow at once more daring, and less scrupulous in resorting to new
courses. For these reasons we should either altogether avoid inflicting
injury, or should inflict every injury at a stroke, and then seek to
reassure men’s minds and suffer them to settle down and rest.




CHAPTER XLVI.—_That Men climb from one step of Ambition to another,
seeking at first to escape Injury and then to injure others._


As the commons of Rome on recovering their freedom were restored to
their former position—nay, to one still stronger since many new laws
had been passed which confirmed and extended their authority,—it might
reasonably have been hoped that Rome would for a time remain at rest.
The event, however, showed the contrary, for from day to day there
arose in that city new tumults and fresh dissensions. And since the
causes which brought this about have been most judiciously set forth by
Titus Livius, it seems to me much to the purpose to cite his own words
when he says, that “whenever either the commons or the nobles were
humble, the others grew haughty; so that if the commons kept within due
bounds, the young nobles began to inflict injuries upon them, against
which the tribunes, who were themselves made the objects of outrage,
were little able to give redress; while the nobles on their part,
although they could not close their eyes to the ill behaviour of their
young men, were yet well pleased that if excesses were to be committed,
they should be committed by their own faction, and not by the commons.
Thus the desire to secure its own liberty prompted each faction to make
itself strong enough to oppress the other. For this is the common
course of things, that in seeking to escape cause for fear, men come to
give others cause to be afraid by inflicting on them those wrongs from
which they strive to relieve themselves; as though the choice lay
between injuring and being injured.”

Herein, among other things, we perceive in what ways commonwealths are
overthrown, and how men climb from one ambition to another; and
recognize the truth of those words which Sallust puts in the mouth of
Cæsar, that “_all ill actions have their origin in fair
beginnings._”[4] For, as I have said already, the ambitious citizen in
a commonwealth seeks at the outset to secure himself against injury,
not only at the hands of private persons, but also of the magistrates;
to effect which he endeavours to gain himself friends. These he obtains
by means honourable in appearance, either by supplying them with money
or protecting them against the powerful. And because such conduct seems
praiseworthy, every one is readily deceived by it, and consequently no
remedy is applied. Pursuing these methods without hindrance, this man
presently comes to be so powerful that private citizens begin to fear
him, and the magistrates to treat him with respect. But when he has
advanced thus far on the road to power without encountering opposition,
he has reached a point at which it is most dangerous to cope with him;
it being dangerous, as I have before explained, to contend with a
disorder which has already made progress in a city. Nevertheless, when
he has brought things to this pass, you must either endeavour to crush
him, at the risk of immediate ruin, or else, unless death or some like
accident interpose, you incur inevitable slavery by letting him alone.
For when, as I have said, it has come to this that the citizens and
even the magistrates fear to offend him and his friends, little further
effort will afterwards be needed to enable him to proscribe and ruin
whom he pleases.

 [4] Quod omnia mala exempla ex bonis initiis orta sunt. (Sall. Cat.
 51.)


A republic ought, therefore, to provide by its ordinances that none of
its citizens shall, under colour of doing good, have it in their power
to do evil, but shall be suffered to acquire such influence only as may
aid and not injure freedom. How this may be done, shall presently be
explained.




CHAPTER XLVII.—_That though Men deceive themselves in Generalities, in
Particulars they judge truly._


The commons of Rome having, as I have said, grown disgusted with the
consular name, and desiring either that men of plebeian birth should be
admitted to the office or its authority be restricted, the nobles, to
prevent its degradation in either of these two ways, proposed a middle
course, whereby four tribunes, who might either be plebeians or nobles,
were to be created with consular authority. This compromise satisfied
the commons, who thought they would thus get rid of the consulship, and
secure the highest offices of the State for their own order. But here a
circumstance happened worth noting. When the four tribunes came to be
chosen, the people, who had it in their power to choose all from the
commons, chose all from the nobles. With respect to which election
Titus Livius observes, that “_the result showed that the people when
declaring their honest judgment after controversy was over, were
governed by a different spirit from that which had inspired them while
contending for their liberties and for a share in public honours_.” The
reason for this I believe to be, that men deceive themselves more
readily in generals than in particulars. To the commons of Rome it
seemed, in the abstract, that they had every right to be admitted to
the consulship, since their party in the city was the more numerous,
since they bore the greater share of danger in their wars, and since it
was they who by their valour kept Rome free and made her powerful. And
because it appeared to them, as I have said, that their desire was a
reasonable one, they were resolved to satisfy it at all hazards. But
when they had to form a particular judgment on the men of their own
party, they recognized their defects, and decided that individually no
one of them was deserving of what, collectively, they seemed entitled
to; and being ashamed of them, turned to bestow their honours on those
who deserved them. Of which decision Titus Livius, speaking with due
admiration, says, “_Where shall we now find in any one man, that
modesty, moderation, and magnanimity which were then common to the
entire people?_”

As confirming what I have said, I shall cite another noteworthy
incident, which occurred in Capua after the rout of the Romans by
Hannibal at Cannæ. For all Italy being convulsed by that defeat, Capua
too was threatened with civil tumult, through the hatred which
prevailed between her people and senate. But Pacuvius Calavius, who at
this time filled the office of chief magistrate, perceiving the danger,
took upon himself to reconcile the contending factions. With this
object he assembled the Senate and pointed out to them the hatred in
which they were held by the people, and the risk they ran of being put
to death by them, and of the city, now that the Romans were in
distress, being given up to Hannibal. But he added that, were they to
consent to leave the matter with him, he thought he could contrive to
reconcile them; in the meanwhile, however, he must shut them up in the
palace, that, by putting it in the power of the people to punish them,
he might secure their safety.

The senate consenting to this proposal, he shut them up in the palace,
and summoning the people to a public meeting, told them the time had at
last come for them to trample on the insolence of the nobles, and
requite the wrongs suffered at their hands; for he had them all safe
under bolt and bar; but, as he supposed they did not wish the city to
remain without rulers, it was fit, before putting the old senators to
death, they should appoint others in their room. Wherefore he had
thrown the names of all the old senators into a bag, and would now
proceed to draw them out one by one, and as they were drawn would cause
them to be put to death, so soon as a successor was found for each.
When the first name he drew was declared, there arose a great uproar
among the people, all crying out against the cruelty, pride, and
arrogance of that senator whose name it was. But on Pacuvius desiring
them to propose a substitute, the meeting was quieted, and after a
brief pause one of the commons was nominated. No sooner, however, was
his name mentioned than one began to whistle, another to laugh, some
jeering at him in one way and some in another. And the same thing
happening in every case, each and all of those nominated were judged
unworthy of senatorial rank. Whereupon Pacuvius, profiting by the
opportunity, said, “Since you are agreed that the city would be badly
off without a senate, but are not agreed whom to appoint in the room of
the old senators, it will, perhaps, be well for you to be reconciled to
them; for the fear into which they have been thrown must have so
subdued them, that you are sure to find in them that affability which
hitherto you have looked for in vain.” This proposal being agreed to, a
reconciliation followed between the two orders; the commons having seen
their error so soon as they were obliged to come to particulars.

A people therefore is apt to err in judging of things and their
accidents in the abstract, but on becoming acquainted with particulars,
speedily discovers its mistakes. In the year 1494, when her greatest
citizens were banished from Florence, and no regular government any
longer existed there, but a spirit of licence prevailed, and matters
went continually from bad to worse, many Florentines perceiving the
decay of their city, and discerning no other cause for it, blamed the
ambition of this or the other powerful citizen, who, they thought, was
fomenting these disorders with a view to establish a government to his
own liking, and to rob them of their liberties. Those who thought thus,
would hang about the arcades and public squares, maligning many
citizens, and giving it to be understood that if ever they found
themselves in the Signory, they would expose the designs of these
citizens and have them punished. From time to time it happened that one
or another of those who used this language rose to be of the chief
magistracy, and so soon as he obtained this advancement, and saw things
nearer, became aware whence the disorders I have spoken of really came,
the dangers attending them, and the difficulty in dealing with them;
and recognizing that they were the growth of the times, and not
occasioned by particular men, suddenly altered his views and conduct; a
nearer knowledge of facts freeing him from the false impressions he had
been led into on a general view of affairs. But those who had heard him
speak as a private citizen, when they saw him remain inactive after he
was made a magistrate, believed that this arose not from his having
obtained any better knowledge of things, but from his having been
cajoled or corrupted by the great. And this happening with many men and
often, it came to be a proverb among the people, that “_men had one
mind in the market-place, another in the palace._”

Reflecting on what has been said, we see how quickly men’s eyes may be
opened, if knowing that they deceive themselves in generalities, we can
find a way to make them pass to particulars; as Pacuvius did in the
case of the Capuans, and the senate in the case of Rome. Nor do I
believe that any prudent man need shrink from the judgment of the
people in questions relating to particulars, as, for instance, in the
distribution of honours and dignities. For in such matters only, the
people are either never mistaken, or at any rate far seldomer than a
small number of persons would be, were the distribution entrusted to
them.

It seems to me, however, not out of place to notice in the following
Chapter, a method employed by the Roman senate to enlighten the people
in making this distribution.




CHAPTER XLVIII.—_He who would not have an Office bestowed on some
worthless or wicked Person, should contrive that it be solicited by one
who is utterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the
highest degree noble and good._


Whenever the senate saw a likelihood of the tribunes with consular
powers being chosen exclusively from the commons, it took one or other
of two ways,—either by causing the office to be solicited by the most
distinguished among the citizens; or else, to confess the truth, by
bribing some base and ignoble fellow to fasten himself on to those
other plebeians of better quality who were seeking the office, and
become a candidate conjointly with them. The latter device made the
people ashamed to give, the former ashamed to refuse.

This confirms what I said in my last Chapter, as to the people
deceiving themselves in generalities but not in particulars.




CHAPTER XLIX.—_That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in
Freedom, have had difficulty in framing such Laws as would preserve
their Freedom, Cities which at the first have been in Subjection will
find this almost impossible._


How hard it is in founding a commonwealth to provide it with all the
laws needed to maintain its freedom, is well seen from the history of
the Roman Republic. For although ordinances were given it first by
Romulus, then by Numa, afterwards by Tullus Hostilius and Servius, and
lastly by the Ten created for the express purpose, nevertheless, in the
actual government of Rome new needs were continually developed, to meet
which, new ordinances had constantly to be devised; as in the creation
of the censors, who were one of the chief means by which Rome was kept
free during the whole period of her constitutional government. For as
the censors became the arbiters of morals in Rome, it was very much
owing to them that the progress of the Romans towards corruption was
retarded. And though, at the first creation of the office, a mistake
was doubtless made in fixing its term at five years, this was corrected
not long after by the wisdom of the dictator Mamercus, who passed a law
reducing it to eighteen months; a change which the censors then in
office took in such ill part, that they deprived Mamercus of his rank
as a senator. This step was much blamed both by the commons and the
Fathers; still, as our History does not record that Mamercus obtained
any redress, we must infer either that the Historian has omitted
something, or that on this head the laws of Rome were defective; since
it is never well that the laws of a commonwealth should suffer a
citizen to incur irremediable wrong because he promotes a measure
favourable to freedom.

But returning to the matter under consideration, we have, in connection
with the creation of this new office, to note, that if those cities
which, as was the case with Rome, have had their beginning in freedom,
and have by themselves maintained that freedom, have experienced great
difficulty in framing good laws for the preservation of their
liberties, it is little to be wondered at that cities which at the
first were dependent, should find it not difficult merely but
impossible so to shape their ordinances as to enable them to live free
and undisturbed. This difficulty we see to have arisen in the case of
Florence, which, being subject at first to the power of Rome and
subsequently to that of other rulers, remained long in servitude,
taking no thought for herself; and even afterwards, when she could
breathe more freely and began to frame her own laws, these, since they
were blended with ancient ordinances which were bad, could not
themselves be good; and thus for the two hundred years of which we have
trustworthy record, our city has gone on patching her institutions,
without ever possessing a government in respect of which she could
truly be termed a commonwealth.

The difficulties which have been felt in Florence are the same as have
been felt in all cities which have had a like origin; and although,
repeatedly, by the free and public votes of her citizens, ample
authority has been given to a few of their number to reform her
constitution, no alteration of general utility has ever been
introduced, but only such as forwarded the interests of the party to
which those commissioned to make changes belonged. This, instead of
order, has occasioned the greatest disorder in our city.

But to come to particulars, I say, that among other matters which have
to be considered by the founder of a commonwealth, is the question into
whose hands should be committed the power of life and death over its
citizens’ This was well seen to in Rome, where, as a rule, there was a
right of appeal to the people, but where, on any urgent case arising in
which it might have been dangerous to delay the execution of a judicial
sentence, recourse could be had to a dictator with powers to execute
justice at once; a remedy, however, never resorted to save in cases of
extremity. But Florence, and other cities having a like origin,
committed this power into the hands of a foreigner, whom they styled
Captain, and as he was open to be corrupted by powerful citizens this
was a pernicious course. Altering this arrangement afterwards in
consequence of changes in their government, they appointed eight
citizens to discharge the office of Captain. But this, for a reason
already mentioned, namely that a few will always be governed by the
will of a few and these the most powerful, was a change from bad to
worse.

The city of Venice has guarded herself against a like danger. For in
Venice ten citizens are appointed with power to punish any man without
appeal; and because, although possessing the requisite authority, this
number might not be sufficient to insure the punishment of the
powerful, in addition to their council of Ten, they have also
constituted a council of Forty, and have further provided that the
council of the “_Pregai_,” which is their supreme council, shall have
authority to chastise powerful offenders. So that, unless an accuser be
wanting, a tribunal is never wanting in Venice to keep powerful
citizens in check.

But when we see how in Rome, with ordinances of her own imposing, and
with so many and so wise legislators, fresh occasion arose from day to
day for framing new laws favourable to freedom, it is not to be
wondered at that, in other cities less happy in their beginnings,
difficulties should have sprung up which no ordinances could remedy.




CHAPTER L.—_That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have
power to bring the Government of a City to a stay._


T.Q. CINCINNATUS and Cn. Julius Mento being consuls of Rome, and being
at variance with one another, brought the whole business of the city to
a stay; which the senate perceiving, were moved to create a dictator to
do what, by reason of their differences, the consuls would not. But
though opposed to one another in everything else, the consuls were of
one mind in resisting the appointment of a dictator; so that the senate
had no remedy left them but to seek the help of the tribunes, who,
supported by their authority, forced the consuls to yield.

Here we have to note, first, the usefulness of the tribunes’ authority
in checking the ambitious designs, not only of the nobles against the
commons, but also of one section of the nobles against another; and
next, that in no city ought things ever to be so ordered that it rests
with a few to decide on matters, which, if the ordinary business of the
State is to proceed at all, must be carried out. Wherefore, if you
grant authority to a council to distribute honours and offices, or to a
magistrate to administer any branch of public business, you must either
impose an obligation that the duty confided shall be performed, or
ordain that, on failure to perform, another may and shall do what has
to be done. Otherwise such an arrangement will be found defective and
dangerous; as would have been the case in Rome, had it not been
possible to oppose the authority of the tribunes to the obstinacy of
the consuls.

In the Venetian Republic, the great council distributes honours and
offices. But more than once it has happened that the council, whether
from ill-humour or from being badly advised, has declined to appoint
successors either to the magistrates of the city or to those
administering the government abroad. This gave rise to the greatest
confusion and disorder; for, on a sudden, both the city itself and the
subject provinces found themselves deprived of their lawful governors;
nor could any redress be had until the majority of the council were
pacified or undeceived. And this disorder must have brought the city to
a bad end, had not provision been made against its recurrence by
certain of the wiser citizens, who, finding a fit opportunity, passed a
law that no magistracy, whether within or without the city, should ever
be deemed to have been vacated until it was filled up by the
appointment of a successor. In this way the council was deprived of its
facilities for stopping public business to the danger of the State.




CHAPTER LI.—_What a Prince or Republic does of Necessity, should seem
to be done by Choice_.


In all their actions, even in those which are matters of necessity
rather than choice, prudent men will endeavour so to conduct themselves
as to conciliate good-will. This species of prudence was well exercised
by the Roman senate when they resolved to grant pay from the public
purse to soldiers on active service, who, before, had served at their
own charges. For perceiving that under the old system they could
maintain no war of any duration, and, consequently, could not undertake
a siege or lead an army to any distance from home, and finding it
necessary to be able to do both, they decided on granting the pay I
have spoken of. But this, which they could not help doing, they did in
such a way as to earn the thanks of the people, by whom the concession
was so well received that all Rome was intoxicated with delight. For it
seemed to them a boon beyond any they could have ventured to hope for,
or have dreamed of demanding. And although the tribunes sought to make
light of the benefit, by showing the people that their burthens would
be increased rather than diminished by it, since taxes would have to be
imposed out of which the soldier’s stipend might be paid, they could
not persuade them to regard the measure otherwise than with gratitude;
which was further increased by the manner in which the senate
distributed the taxes, imposing on the nobles all the heavier and
greater, and those which had to be paid first.




CHAPTER LII.—_That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing
too powerful in a State, there is no safer Method, or less open to
objection, than to forestall him in those Ways whereby he seeks to
advance himself_.


It has been seen in the preceding chapter how much credit the nobles
gained with the commons by a show of good-will towards them, not only
in providing for their military pay, but also in adjusting taxation.
Had the senate constantly adhered to methods like these, they would
have put an end to all disturbances in Rome, and have deprived the
tribunes of the credit they had with the people, and of the influence
thence arising. For in truth, in a commonwealth, and especially in one
which has become corrupted, there is no better, or easier, or less
objectionable way of opposing the ambition of any citizen, than to
anticipate him in those paths by which he is seen to be advancing to
the ends he has in view. This plan, had it been followed by the enemies
of Cosimo de’ Medici, would have proved a far more useful course for
them than to banish him from Florence; since if those citizens who
opposed him had adopted his methods for gaining over the people, they
would have succeeded, without violence or tumult, in taking his most
effective weapon from his hands.

The influence acquired in Florence by Piero Soderini was entirely due
to his skill in securing the affections of the people, since in this
way he obtained among them a name for loving the liberties of the
commonwealth. And truly, for those citizens who envied his greatness it
would have been both easier and more honourable, and at the same time
far less dangerous and hurtful to the State, to forestall him in those
measures by which he was growing powerful, than to oppose him in such a
manner that his overthrow must bring with it the ruin of the entire
republic. For had they, as they might easily have done, deprived him of
the weapons which made him formidable, they could then have withstood
him in all the councils, and in all public deliberations, without
either being suspected or feared. And should any rejoin that, if the
citizens who hated Piero Soderini committed an error in not being
beforehand with him in those ways whereby he came to have influence
with the people, Piero himself erred in like manner, in not
anticipating his enemies in those methods whereby they grew formidable
to him; I answer that Piero is to be excused, both because it would
have been difficult for him to have so acted, and because for him such
a course would not have been honourable. For the paths wherein his
danger lay were those which favoured the Medici, and it was by these
that his enemies attacked him, and in the end overthrew him. But these
paths Piero could not pursue without dishonour, since he could not, if
he was to preserve his fair fame, have joined in destroying that
liberty which he had been put forward to defend. Moreover, since
favours to the Medicean party could not have been rendered secretly and
once for all, they would have been most dangerous for Piero, who, had
he shown himself friendly to the Medici, must have become suspected and
hated by the people; in which case his enemies would have had still
better opportunities than before for his destruction.

Men ought therefore to look to the risks and dangers of any course
which lies before them, nor engage in it when it is plain that the
dangers outweigh the advantages, even though they be advised by others
that it is the most expedient way to take. Should they act otherwise,
it will fare with them as with Tullius, who, in seeking to diminish the
power of Marcus Antonius, added to it. For Antonius, who had been
declared an enemy by the senate, having got together a strong force,
mostly made up of veterans who had shared the fortunes of Cæsar,
Tullius counselled the senate to invest Octavianus with full authority,
and to send him against Antonius with the consuls and the army;
affirming, that so soon as those veterans who had served with Cæsar saw
the face of him who was Cæsar’s nephew and had assumed his name, they
would rally to his side and desert Antonius, who might easily be
crushed when thus left bare of support.

But the reverse of all this happened. For Antonius persuaded Octavianus
to take part with him, and to throw over Tullius and the senate. And
this brought about the ruin of the senate, a result which might easily
have been foreseen. For remembering the influence of that great
captain, who, after overthrowing all opponents, had seized on sovereign
power in Rome, the senate should have turned a deaf ear to the
persuasions of Tullius, nor ever have believed it possible that from
Cæsar’s heir, or from soldiers who had followed Cæsar, they could look
for anything that consisted with the name of Freedom.




CHAPTER LIII.—_That the People, deceived by a false show of Advantage,
often desire what would be their Ruin; and that large Hopes and brave
Promises easily move them_.


When Veii fell, the commons of Rome took up the notion that it would be
to the advantage of their city were half their number to go and dwell
there. For they argued that as Veii lay in a fertile country and was a
well-built city, a moiety of the Roman people might in this way be
enriched; while, by reason of its vicinity to Rome, the management of
civil affairs would in no degree be affected. To the senate, however,
and the wiser among the citizens, the scheme appeared so rash and
mischievous that they publicly declared they would die sooner than
consent to it. The controversy continuing, the commons grew so inflamed
against the senate that violence and bloodshed must have ensued; had
not the senate for their protection put forward certain old and
esteemed citizens, respect for whom restrained the populace and put a
stop to their violence.

Two points are here to be noted. First, that a people deceived by a
false show of advantage will often labour for its own destruction; and,
unless convinced by some one whom it trusts, that the course on which
it is bent is pernicious, and that some other is to be preferred, will
bring infinite danger and injury upon the State. And should it so
happen, as sometimes is the case, that from having been deceived
before, either by men or by events, there is none in whom the people
trust, their ruin is inevitable. As to which Dante, in his treatise “De
Monarchia,” observes that the people will often raise the cry,
“_Flourish our death and perish our life_.”[5] From which distrust it
arises that often in republics the right course is not followed; as
when Venice, as has been related, on being attacked by many enemies,
could not, until her ruin was complete, resolve to make friends with
any one of them by restoring those territories she had taken from them,
on account of which war had been declared and a league of princes
formed against her.

 [5] “Viva la sua morte e muoia la sua vita.” The quotation does _not_
 seem to be from the “De Monarchia.”


In considering what courses it is easy, and what it is difficult to
persuade a people to follow, this distinction may be drawn: Either what
you would persuade them to, presents on the face of it a semblance of
gain or loss, or it seems a spirited course or a base one. When any
proposal submitted to the people holds out promise of advantage, or
seems to them a spirited course to take, though loss lie hid behind,
nay, though the ruin of their country be involved in it, they will
always be easily led to adopt it; whereas it will always be difficult
to persuade the adoption of such courses as wear the appearance of
disgrace or loss, even though safety and advantage be bound up with
them. The truth of what I say is confirmed by numberless examples both
Roman and foreign, modern and ancient. Hence grew the ill opinion
entertained in Rome of Fabius Maximus, who could never persuade the
people that it behoved them to proceed warily in their conflict with
Hannibal, and withstand his onset without fighting. For this the people
thought a base course, not discerning the advantage resulting from it,
which Fabius could by no argument make plain to them. And so blinded
are men in favour of what seems a spirited course, that although the
Romans had already committed the blunder of permitting Varro, master of
the knights to Fabius, to join battle contrary to the latter’s desire,
whereby the army must have been destroyed had not Fabius by his
prudence saved it, this lesson was not enough; for afterwards they
appointed this Varro to be consul, for no other reason than that he
gave out, in the streets and market-places, that he would make an end
of Hannibal as soon as leave was given him to do so. Whence came the
battle and defeat of Cannæ, and well-nigh the destruction of Rome.

Another example taken from Roman history may be cited to the same
effect. After Hannibal had maintained himself for eight or ten years in
Italy, during which time the whole country had been deluged with Roman
blood, a certain Marcus Centenius Penula, a man of mean origin, but who
had held some post in the army, came forward and proposed to the senate
that were leave given him to raise a force of volunteers in any part of
Italy he pleased, he would speedily deliver Hannibal into their hands,
alive or dead. To the senate this man’s offer seemed a rash one; but
reflecting that were they to refuse it, and were the people afterwards
to hear that it had been made, tumults, ill will, and resentment
against them would result, they granted the permission asked; choosing
rather to risk the lives of all who might follow Penula, than to excite
fresh discontent on the part of the people, to whom they knew that such
a proposal would be welcome, and that it would be very hard to dissuade
them from it. And so this adventurer, marching forth with an
undisciplined and disorderly rabble to meet Hannibal, was, with all his
followers, defeated and slain in the very first encounter.

In Greece, likewise, and in the city of Athens, that most grave and
prudent statesman, Nicias, could not convince the people that the
proposal to go and attack Sicily was disadvantageous; and the
expedition being resolved on, contrary to his advice and to the wishes
of the wiser among the citizens, resulted in the overthrow of the
Athenian power. Scipio, on being appointed consul, asked that the
province of Africa might be awarded to him, promising that he would
utterly efface Carthage; and when the senate, on the advice of Fabius,
refused his request, he threatened to submit the matter to the people
as very well knowing that to the people such proposals are always
acceptable.

I might cite other instances to the same effect from the history of our
own city, as when Messer Ercole Bentivoglio and Antonio Giacomini,
being in joint command of the Florentine armies, after defeating
Bartolommeo d’Alviano at San Vincenzo, proceeded to invest Pisa. For
this enterprise was resolved on by the people in consequence of the
brave promises of Messer Ercole; and though many wise citizens
disapproved of it, they could do nothing to prevent it, being carried
away by the popular will, which took its rise in the assurances of
their captain.

I say, then, that there is no readier way to bring about the ruin of a
republic, when the power is in the hands of the people, than to suggest
daring courses for their adoption. For wherever the people have a
voice, such proposals will always be well received, nor will those
persons who are opposed to them be able to apply any remedy. And as
this occasions the ruin of States, it likewise, and even more
frequently, occasions the private ruin of those to whom the execution
of these proposals is committed; because the people anticipating
victory, do not when there comes defeat ascribe it to the short means
or ill fortune of the commander, but to his cowardice and incapacity;
and commonly either put him to death, or imprison or banish him; as was
done in the case of numberless Carthaginian generals and of many
Athenian, no successes they might previously have obtained availing
them anything; for all past services are cancelled by a present loss.
And so it happened with our Antonio Giacomini, who not succeeding as
the people had expected, and as he had promised, in taking Pisa, fell
into such discredit with the people, that notwithstanding his countless
past services, his life was spared rather by the compassion of those in
authority than through any movement of the citizens in his behalf.




CHAPTER LIV.—_Of the boundless Authority which a great Man may use to
restrain an excited Multitude_.


The next noteworthy point in the passage referred to in the foregoing
Chapter is, that nothing tends so much to restrain an excited multitude
as the reverence felt for some grave person, clothed with authority,
who stands forward to oppose them. For not without reason has Virgil
said—

“If then, by chance, some reverend chief appear,
Known for his deeds and for his virtues dear,
Silent they wait his words and bend a listening ear.”[6]


 [6] Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem
Conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant.
          _Virg. Aen._, I. 154.


He therefore who commands an army or governs a city wherein tumult
shall have broken out, ought to assume the noblest and bravest bearing
he can, and clothe himself with all the ensigns of his station, that he
may make himself more revered. It is not many years since Florence was
divided into two factions, the _Frateschi_ and _Arrabbiati_, as they
were named, and these coming to open violence, the _Frateschi_, among
whom was Pagolo Antonio Soderini, a citizen of great reputation in
these days, were worsted. In the course of these disturbances the
people coming with arms in their hands to plunder the house of
Soderini, his brother Messer Francesco, then bishop of Volterra and now
cardinal, who happened to be dwelling there, so soon as he heard the
uproar and saw the crowd, putting on his best apparel and over it his
episcopal robes, went forth to meet the armed multitude, and by his
words and mien brought them to a stay; and for many days his behaviour
was commended by the whole city. The inference from all which is, that
there is no surer or more necessary restraint on the violence of an
unruly multitude, than the presence of some one whose character and
bearing command respect.

But to return once more to the passage we are considering, we see how
stubbornly the people clung to this scheme of transplanting themselves
to Veii, thinking it for their advantage, and not discerning the
mischief really involved in it; so that in addition to the many
dissensions which it occasioned, actual violence must have followed,
had not the senate with the aid of certain grave and reverend citizens
repressed the popular fury.




CHAPTER LV.—_That Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the
body of the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible
where Equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not_.


Though what we have to fear or hope from cities that have grown
corrupted has already been discussed, still I think it not out of place
to notice a resolution passed by the senate touching the vow which
Camillus made to Apollo of a tenth of the spoil taken from the
Veientines. For this spoil having fallen into the hands of the people,
the senate, being unable by other means to get any account of it,
passed an edict that every man should publicly offer one tenth part of
what he had taken. And although this edict was not carried out, from
the senate having afterwards followed a different course, whereby, to
the content of the people, the claim of Apollo was otherwise satisfied,
we nevertheless see from their having entertained such a proposal, how
completely the senate trusted to the honesty of the people, when they
assumed that no one would withhold any part of what the edict commanded
him to give; on the other hand, we see that it never occurred to the
people that they might evade the law by giving less than was due, their
only thought being to free themselves from the law by openly
manifesting their displeasure. This example, together with many others
already noticed, shows how much virtue and how profound a feeling of
religion prevailed among the Roman people, and how much good was to be
expected from them. And, in truth, in the country where virtue like
this does not exist, no good can be looked for, as we should look for
it in vain in provinces which at the present day are seen to be
corrupted; as Italy is beyond all others, though, in some degree,
France and Spain are similarly tainted. In which last two countries, if
we see not so many disorders spring up as we see daily springing up in
Italy, this is not so much due to the superior virtue of their
inhabitants (who, to say truth, fall far short of our countrymen), as
to their being governed by a king who keeps them united, not merely by
his personal qualities, but also by the laws and ordinances of the
realm which are still maintained with vigour. In Germany, however, we
do see signal excellence and a devout religious spirit prevail among
the people, giving rise to the many free States which there maintain
themselves, with such strict observance of their laws that none, either
within or without their walls, dare encroach on them.

That among this last-named people a great share of the ancient
excellence does in truth still flourish, I shall show by an example
similar to that which I have above related of the senate and people of
Rome. It is customary with the German Free States when they have to
expend any large sum of money on the public account, for their
magistrates or councils having authority given them in that behalf, to
impose a rate of one or two in the hundred on every man’s estate; which
rate being fixed, every man, in conformity with the laws of the city,
presents himself before the collectors of the impost, and having first
made oath to pay the amount justly due, throws into a chest provided
for the purpose what he conscientiously believes it fair for him to
pay, of which payment none is witness save himself. From this fact it
may be gathered what honesty and religion still prevail among this
people. For we must assume that each pays his just share, since
otherwise the impost would not yield the sum which, with reference to
former imposts, it was estimated to yield; whereby the fraud would be
detected, and thereupon some other method for raising money have to be
resorted to.

At the present time this virtue is the more to be admired, because it
seems to have survived in this province only. That it has survived
there may be ascribed to two circumstances: _first_, that the natives
have little communication with their neighbours, neither visiting them
in their countries nor being visited by them; being content to use such
commodities, and subsist on such food, and to wear garments of such
materials as their own land supplies; so that all occasion for
intercourse, and every cause of corruption is removed. For living after
this fashion, they have not learned the manners of the French, the
Italians, or the Spaniards, which three nations together are the
corruption of the world. The _second_ cause is, that these republics in
which a free and pure government is maintained will not suffer any of
their citizens either to be, or to live as gentlemen; but on the
contrary, while preserving a strict equality among themselves, are
bitterly hostile to all those gentlemen and lords who dwell in their
neighbourhood; so that if by chance any of these fall into their hands,
they put them to death, as the chief promoters of corruption and the
origin of all disorders.

But to make plain what I mean when I speak of _gentlemen_, I say that
those are so to be styled who live in opulence and idleness on the
revenues of their estates, without concerning themselves with the
cultivation of these estates, or incurring any other fatigue for their
support. Such persons are very mischievous in every republic or
country. But even more mischievous are they who, besides the estates I
have spoken of, are lords of strongholds and castles, and have vassals
and retainers who render them obedience. Of these two classes of men
the kingdom of Naples, the country round Rome, Romagna, and Lombardy
are full; and hence it happens that in these provinces no commonwealth
or free form of government has ever existed; because men of this sort
are the sworn foes to all free institutions.

And since to plant a commonwealth in provinces which are in this
condition were impossible, if these are to be reformed at all, it can
only be by some one man who is able there to establish a kingdom; the
reason being that when the body of the people is grown so corrupted
that the laws are powerless to control it, there must in addition to
the laws be introduced a stronger force, to wit, the regal, which by
its absolute and unrestricted authority may curb the excessive ambition
and corruption of the great. This opinion may be supported by the
example of Tuscany, in which within a narrow compass of territory there
have long existed the three republics of Florence, Lucca, and Siena,
while the other cities of that province, although to a certain extent
dependent, still show by their spirit and by their institutions that
they preserve, or at any rate desire to preserve, their freedom: and
this because there are in Tuscany no lords possessed of strongholds,
and few or no gentlemen, but so complete an equality prevails, that a
prudent statesman, well acquainted with the history of the free States
of antiquity, might easily introduce free institutions. Such, however,
has been the unhappiness of this our country, that, up to the present
hour, it has never produced any man with the power and knowledge which
would have enabled him to act in this way.

From what has been said, it follows, that he who would found a
commonwealth in a country wherein there are many gentlemen, cannot do
so unless he first gets rid of them; and that he who would found a
monarchy or princedom in a country wherein great equality prevails,
will never succeed, unless he raise above the level of that equality
many persons of a restless and ambitious temperament, whom he must make
gentlemen not in name merely but in reality, by conferring on them
castles and lands, supplying them with riches, and providing them with
retainers; that with these gentlemen around him, and with their help,
he may maintain his power, while they through him may gratify their
ambition; all others being constrained to endure a yoke, which force
and force alone imposes on them. For when in this way there comes to be
a proportion between him who uses force and him against whom it is
used, each stands fixed in his own station.

But to found a commonwealth in a country suited for a kingdom, or a
kingdom in a country suited to be a commonwealth, requires so rare a
combination of intelligence and power, that though many engage in the
attempt, few are found to succeed. For the greatness of the undertaking
quickly daunts them, and so obstructs their advance they break down at
the very outset. The case of the Venetian Republic, wherein none save
gentlemen are permitted to hold any public office, does, doubtless,
seem opposed to this opinion of mine that where there are gentlemen it
is impossible to found a commonwealth. But it may be answered that the
case of Venice is not in truth an instance to the contrary; since the
gentlemen of Venice are gentlemen rather in name than in reality,
inasmuch as they draw no great revenues from lands, their wealth
consisting chiefly in merchandise and chattels, and not one of them
possessing a castle or enjoying any feudal authority. For in Venice
this name of gentleman is a title of honour and dignity, and does not
depend on any of those circumstances in respect of which the name is
given in other States. But as in other States the different ranks and
classes are divided under different names, so in Venice we have the
division into gentlemen (_gentiluomini_) and plebeians (_popolani_), it
being understood that the former hold, or have the right to hold all
situations of honour, from which the latter are entirely excluded. And
in Venice this occasions no disturbance, for reasons which I have
already explained.

Let a commonwealth, then, be constituted in the country where a great
equality is found or has been made; and, conversely, let a princedom be
constituted where great inequality prevails. Otherwise what is
constituted will be discordant in itself, and without stability.




CHAPTER LVI.—_That when great Calamities are about to befall a City or
Country, Signs are seen to presage, and Seers arise who foretell them_.


Whence it happens I know not, but it is seen from examples both ancient
and recent, that no grave calamity has ever befallen any city or
country which has not been foretold by vision, by augury, by portent,
or by some other Heaven-sent sign. And not to travel too far afield for
evidence of this, every one knows that long before the invasion of
Italy by Charles VIII. of France, his coming was foretold by the friar
Girolamo Savonarola; and how, throughout the whole of Tuscany, the
rumour ran that over Arezzo horsemen had been seen fighting in the air.
And who is there who has not heard that before the death of the elder
Lorenzo de’ Medici, the highest pinnacle of the cathedral was rent by a
thunderbolt, to the great injury of the building? Or who, again, but
knows that shortly before Piero Soderini, whom the people of Florence
had made gonfalonier for life, was deprived of his office and banished,
the palace itself was struck by lightning?

Other instances might be cited, which, not to be tedious, I shall omit,
and mention only a circumstance which Titus Livius tells us preceded
the invasion of the Gauls. For he relates how a certain plebeian named
Marcus Ceditius reported to the senate that as he passed by night along
the Via Nova, he heard a voice louder than mortal, bidding him warn the
magistrates that the Gauls were on their way to Rome.

The causes of such manifestations ought, I think, to be inquired into
and explained by some one who has a knowledge, which I have not, of
causes natural and supernatural. It may, however, be, as certain wise
men say, that the air is filled with intelligent beings, to whom it is
given to forecast future events; who, taking pity upon men, warn them
beforehand by these signs to prepare for what awaits them. Be this as
it may, certain it is that such warnings are given, and that always
after them new and strange disasters befall nations.




CHAPTER LVII.—_That the People are strong collectively, but
individually weak_.


After the ruin brought on their country by the invasion of the Gauls,
many of the Romans went to dwell in Veii, in opposition to the edicts
and commands of the senate, who, to correct this mischief, publicly
ordained that within a time fixed, and under penalties stated, all
should return to live in Rome. The persons against whom these
proclamations were directed at first derided them; but, when the time
came for them to be obeyed, all obeyed them. And Titus Livius observes
that, “_although bold enough collectively, each separately, fearing to
be punished, made his submission_.” And indeed the temper of the
multitude in such cases, cannot be better described than in this
passage. For often a people will be open-mouthed in condemning the
decrees of their prince, but afterwards, when they have to look
punishment in the face, putting no trust in one another, they hasten to
comply. Wherefore, if you be in a position to keep the people
well-disposed towards you when they already are so, or to prevent them
injuring you in case they be ill-disposed, it is clearly of little
moment whether the feelings with which they profess to regard you, be
favourable or no. This applies to all unfriendliness on the part of a
people, whencesoever it proceed, excepting only the resentment felt by
them on being deprived either of liberty, or of a prince whom they love
and who still survives. For the hostile temper produced by these two
causes is more to be feared than any beside, and demands measures of
extreme severity to correct it. The other untoward humours of the
multitude, should there be no powerful chief to foster them, are easily
dealt with; because, while on the one hand there is nothing more
terrible than an uncontrolled and headless mob, on the other, there is
nothing feebler. For though it be furnished with arms it is easily
subdued, if you have some place of strength wherein to shelter from its
first onset. For when its first fury has somewhat abated, and each man
sees that he has to return to his own house, all begin to lose heart
and to take thought how to insure their personal safety, whether by
flight or by submission. For which reason a multitude stirred in this
way, if it would avoid dangers such as I speak of, must at once appoint
a head from among its own numbers, who may control it, keep it united,
and provide for its defence; as did the commons of Rome when, after the
death of Virginia, they quitted the city, and for their protection
created twenty tribunes from among themselves. Unless this be done,
what Titus Livius has observed in the passage cited, will always prove
true, namely, that a multitude is strong while it holds together, but
so soon as each of those who compose it begins to think of his own
private danger, it becomes weak and contemptible.




CHAPTER LVIII.—_That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince_


That “_nothing is more fickle and inconstant than the multitude_” is
affirmed not by Titus Livius only, but by all other historians, in
whose chronicles of human actions we often find the multitude
condemning some citizen to death, and afterwards lamenting him and
grieving greatly for his loss, as the Romans grieved and lamented for
Manlius Capitolinus, whom they had themselves condemned to die. In
relating which circumstance our author observes “_In a short time the
people, having no longer cause to fear him, began to deplore his
death_” And elsewhere, when speaking of what took place in Syracuse
after the murder of Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero, he says, “_It is the
nature of the multitude to be an abject slave, or a domineering
master_”

It may be that in attempting to defend a cause, which, as I have said,
all writers are agreed to condemn, I take upon me a task so hard and
difficult that I shall either have to relinquish it with shame or
pursue it with opprobrium. Be that as it may, I neither do, nor ever
shall judge it a fault, to support opinion by arguments, where it is
not sought to impose them by violence or authority I maintain, then,
that this infirmity with which historians tax the multitude, may with
equal reason be charged against every individual man, but most of all
against princes, since all who are not controlled by the laws, will
commit the very same faults as are committed by an uncontrolled
multitude. Proof whereof were easy, since of all the many princes
existing, or who have existed, few indeed are or have been either wise
or good.

I speak of such princes as have had it in their power to break the
reins by which they are controlled, among whom I do not reckon those
kings who reigned in Egypt in the most remote antiquity when that
country was governed in conformity with its laws; nor do I include
those kings who reigned in Sparta, nor those who in our own times reign
in France, which kingdom, more than any other whereof we have knowledge
at the present day, is under the government of its laws. For kings who
live, as these do, subject to constitutional restraint, are not to be
counted when we have to consider each man’s proper nature, and to see
whether he resembles the multitude. For to draw a comparison with such
princes as these, we must take the case of a multitude controlled as
they are, and regulated by the laws, when we shall find it to possess
the same virtues which we see in them, and neither conducting itself as
an abject slave nor as a domineering master.

Such was the people of Rome, who, while the commonwealth continued
uncorrupted, never either served abjectly nor domineered haughtily;
but, on the contrary, by means of their magistrates and their
ordinances, maintained their place, and when forced to put forth their
strength against some powerful citizen, as in the case of Manlius, the
decemvirs, and others who sought to oppress them, did so; but when it
was necessary for the public welfare to yield obedience to the dictator
or consuls, obeyed. And if the Roman people mourned the loss of the
dead Manlius, it is no wonder; for they mourned his virtues, which had
been of such a sort that their memory stirred the regret of all, and
would have had power to produce the same feelings even in a prince; all
writers being agreed that excellence is praised and admired even by its
enemies. But if Manlius when he was so greatly mourned, could have
risen once more from the dead, the Roman people would have pronounced
the same sentence against him which they pronounced when they led him
forth from the prison-house, and straightway condemned him to die. And
in like manner we see that princes, accounted wise, have put men to
death, and afterwards greatly lamented them, as Alexander mourned for
Clitus and others of his friends, and Herod for Mariamne.

But what our historian says of the multitude, he says not of a
multitude which like the people of Rome is controlled by the laws, but
of an uncontrolled multitude like the Syracusans, who were guilty of
all these crimes which infuriated and ungoverned men commit, and which
were equally committed by Alexander and Herod in the cases mentioned.
Wherefore the nature of a multitude is no more to be blamed than the
nature of princes, since both equally err when they can do so without
regard to consequences. Of which many instances, besides those already
given, might be cited from the history of the Roman emperors, and of
other princes and tyrants, in whose lives we find such inconstancy and
fickleness, as we might look in vain for in a people.

I maintain, therefore, contrary to the common opinion which avers that
a people when they have the management of affairs are changeable,
fickle, and ungrateful, that these faults exist not in them otherwise
than as they exist in individual princes; so that were any to accuse
both princes and peoples, the charge might be true, but that to make
exception in favour of princes is a mistake; for a people in command,
if it be duly restrained, will have the same prudence and the same
gratitude as a prince has, or even more, however wise he may be
reckoned; and a prince on the other hand, if freed from the control of
the laws, will be more ungrateful, fickle, and short-sighted than a
people. And further, I say that any difference in their methods of
acting results not from any difference in their nature, that being the
same in both, or, if there be advantage on either side, the advantage
resting with the people, but from their having more or less respect for
the laws under which each lives. And whosoever attentively considers
the history of the Roman people, may see that for four hundred years
they never relaxed in their hatred of the regal name, and were
constantly devoted to the glory and welfare of their country, and will
find numberless proofs given by them of their consistency in both
particulars. And should any allege against me the ingratitude they
showed to Scipio, I reply by what has already been said at length on
that head, where I proved that peoples are less ungrateful than
princes. But as for prudence and stability of purpose, I affirm that a
people is more prudent, more stable, and of better judgment than a
prince. Nor is it without reason that the voice of the people has been
likened to the voice of God; for we see that wide-spread beliefs fulfil
themselves, and bring about marvellous results, so as to have the
appearance of presaging by some occult quality either weal or woe.
Again, as to the justice of their opinions on public affairs, seldom
find that after hearing two speakers of equal ability urging them in
opposite directions, they do not adopt the sounder view, or are unable
to decide on the truth of what they hear. And if, as I have said, a
people errs in adopting courses which appear to it bold and
advantageous, princes will likewise err when their passions are
touched, as is far oftener the case with them than with a people.

We see, too, that in the choice of magistrates a people will choose far
more honestly than a prince; so that while you shall never persuade a
people that it is advantageous to confer dignities on the infamous and
profligate, a prince may readily, and in a thousand ways, be drawn to
do so. Again, it may be seen that a people, when once they have come to
hold a thing in abhorrence, remain for many ages of the same mind;
which we do not find happen with princes. For the truth of both of
which assertions the Roman people are my sufficient witness, who, in
the course of so many hundred years, and in so many elections of
consuls and tribunes, never made four appointments of which they had
reason to repent; and, as I have said, so detested the name of king,
that no obligation they might be under to any citizen who affected that
name, could shield him from the appointed penalty.

Further, we find that those cities wherein the government is in the
hands of the people, in a very short space of time, make marvellous
progress, far exceeding that made by cities which have been always
ruled by princes; as Rome grew after the expulsion of her kings, and
Athens after she freed herself from Pisistratus; and this we can
ascribe to no other cause than that the rule of a people is better than
the rule of a prince.

Nor would I have it thought that anything our historian may have
affirmed in the passage cited, or elsewhere, controverts these my
opinions. For if all the glories and all the defects both of peoples
and of princes be carefully weighed, it will appear that both for
goodness and for glory a people is to be preferred. And if princes
surpass peoples in the work of legislation, in shaping civil
institutions, in moulding statutes, and framing new ordinances, so far
do the latter surpass the former in maintaining what has once been
established, as to merit no less praise than they.

And to state the sum of the whole matter shortly, I say that popular
governments have endured for long periods in the same way as the
governments of princes, and that both have need to be regulated by the
laws; because the prince who can do what he pleases is a madman, and
the people which can do as it pleases is never wise. If, then, we
assume the case of a prince bound, and of a people chained down by the
laws, greater virtue will appear in the people than in the prince;
while if we assume the case of each of them freed from all control, it
will be seen that the people commits fewer errors than the prince, and
less serious errors, and such as admit of readier cure. For a turbulent
and unruly people may be spoken to by a good man, and readily brought
back to good ways; but none can speak to a wicked prince, nor any
remedy be found against him but by the sword. And from this we may
infer which of the two suffers from the worse disease; for if the
disease of the people may be healed by words, while that of the prince
must be dealt with by the sword, there is none but will judge that evil
to be the greater which demands the more violent remedy.

When a people is absolutely uncontrolled, it is not so much the follies
which it commits or the evil which it actually does that excites alarm,
as the mischief which may thence result, since in such disorders it
becomes possible for a tyrant to spring up. But with a wicked prince
the contrary is the case; for we dread present ill, and place our hopes
in the future, persuading ourselves that the evil life of the prince
may bring about our freedom. So that there is this distinction between
the two, that with the one we fear what is, with the other what is
likely to be. Again, the cruelties of a people are turned against him
who it fears will encroach upon the common rights, but the cruelties of
the prince against those who he fears may assert those rights.

The prejudice which is entertained against the people arises from this,
that any man may speak ill of them openly and fearlessly, even when the
government is in their hands; whereas princes are always spoken of with
a thousand reserves and a constant eye to consequences.

But since the subject suggests it, it seems to me not out of place to
consider what alliances we can most trust, whether those made with
commonwealths or those made with princes.




CHAPTER LIX.—_To what Leagues or Alliances we may most trust; whether
those we make with Commonwealths or those we make with Princes_.


Since leagues and alliances are every day entered into by one prince
with another, or by one commonwealth with another, and as conventions
and treaties are concluded in like manner between princes and
commonwealths, it seems to me proper to inquire whether the faith of a
commonwealth or that of a prince is the more stable and the safer to
count on. All things considered, I am disposed to believe that in most
cases they are alike, though in some they differ. Of one thing,
however, I am convinced, namely, that engagements made under duress
will never be observed either by prince or by commonwealth; and that if
menaced with the loss of their territories, both the one and the other
will break faith with you and treat you with ingratitude. Demetrius,
who was named the “City-taker,” had conferred numberless benefits upon
the Athenians; but when, afterwards, on being defeated by his enemies,
he sought shelter in Athens, as being a friendly city and under
obligations to him, it was refused him; a circumstance which grieved
him far more than the loss of his soldiers and army had done. Pompey,
in like manner, when routed by Cæsar in Thessaly, fled for refuge to
Ptolemy in Egypt, who formerly had been restored by him to his kingdom;
by whom he was put to death. In both these instances the same causes
were at work, although the inhumanity and the wrong inflicted were less
in the case of the commonwealth than of the prince. Still, wherever
there is fear, the want of faith will be the same.

And even if there be found a commonwealth or prince who, in order to
keep faith, will submit to be ruined, this is seen to result from a
like cause. For, as to the prince, it may easily happen that he is
friend to a powerful sovereign, whom, though he be at the time without
means to defend him, he may presently hope to see restored to his
dominions; or it may be that having linked his fortunes with another’s,
he despairs of finding either faith or friendship from the enemies of
his ally, as was the case with those Neapolitan princes who espoused
the interests of France. As to commonwealths, an instance similar to
that of the princes last named, is that of Saguntum in Spain, which
awaited ruin in adhering to the fortunes of Rome. A like course was
also followed by Florence when, in the year 1512, she stood steadfastly
by the cause of the French. And taking everything into account, I
believe that in cases of urgency, we shall find a certain degree of
stability sooner in commonwealths than in princes. For though
commonwealths be like-minded with princes, and influenced by the same
passions, the circumstance that their movements must be slower, makes
it harder for them to resolve than it is for a prince, for which reason
they will be less ready to break faith.

And since leagues and alliances are broken for the sake of certain
advantages, in this respect also, commonwealths observe their
engagements far more faithfully than princes; for abundant examples
might be cited of a very slight advantage having caused a prince to
break faith, and of a very great advantage having failed to induce a
commonwealth to do so. Of this we have an instance in the proposal made
to the Athenians by Themistocles, when he told them at a public meeting
that he had certain advice to offer which would prove of great
advantage to their city, but the nature of which he could not disclose
to them, lest it should become generally known, when the opportunity
for acting upon it would be lost. Whereupon the Athenians named
Aristides to receive his communication, and to act upon it as he
thought fit. To him, accordingly, Themistocles showed how the navy of
united Greece, for the safety of which the Athenians stood pledged, was
so situated that they might either gain it over or destroy it, and thus
make themselves absolute masters of the whole country. Aristides
reporting to the Athenians that the course proposed by Themistocles was
extremely advantageous but extremely dishonourable, the people utterly
refused to entertain it. But Philip of Macedon would not have so acted,
nor any of those other princes who have sought and found more profit in
breaking faith than in any other way.

As to engagements broken off on the pretext that they have not been
observed by the other side, I say nothing, since that is a matter of
everyday occurrence, and I am speaking here only of those engagements
which are broken off on extraordinary grounds; but in this respect,
likewise, I believe that commonwealths offend less than princes, and
are therefore more to be trusted.




CHAPTER LX.—_That the Consulship and all the other Magistracies in Rome
were given without respect to Age_.


It is seen in the course of the Roman history that, after the
consulship was thrown open to the commons, the republic conceded this
dignity to all its citizens, without distinction either of age or
blood; nay, that in this matter respect for age was never made a ground
for preference among the Romans, whose constant aim it was to discover
excellence whether existing in old or young. To this we have the
testimony of Valerius Corvinus, himself made consul in his
twenty-fourth year, who, in addressing his soldiers, said of the
consulship that it was “_the reward not of birth but of desert_.”

Whether the course thus followed by the Romans was well judged or not,
is a question on which much might be said. The concession as to blood,
however, was made under necessity, and as I have observed on another
occasion, the same necessity which obtained in Rome, will be found to
obtain in every other city which desires to achieve the results which
Rome achieved. For you cannot subject men to hardships unless you hold
out rewards, nor can you without danger deprive them of those rewards
whereof you have held out hopes. It was consequently necessary to
extend, betimes, to the commons the hope of obtaining the consulship,
on which hope they fed themselves for a while, without actually
realizing it. But afterwards the hope alone was not enough, and it had
to be satisfied. For while cities which do not employ men of plebeian
birth in any of those undertakings wherein glory is to be gained, as we
have seen was the case with Venice, may treat these men as they please,
those other cities which desire to do as Rome did, cannot make this
distinction. And if there is to be no distinction in respect of blood,
nothing can be pleaded for a distinction in respect of age. On the
contrary, that distinction must of necessity cease to be observed. For
where a young man is appointed to a post which requires the prudence
which are is supposed to bring, it must be, since the choice rests with
the people, that he is thus advanced in consideration of some noble
action which he has performed; but when a young man is of such
excellence as to have made a name for himself by some signal
achievement, it were much to the detriment of his city were it unable
at once to make use of him, but had to wait until he had grown old, and
had lost, with youth, that alacrity and vigour by which his country
might have profited; as Rome profited by the services of Valerius
Corvinus, of Scipio, of Pompey, and of many others who triumphed while
yet very young.




BOOK II.


PREFACE.


Men do always, but not always with reason, commend the past and condemn
the present, and are so much the partisans of what has been, as not
merely to cry up those times which are known to them only from the
records left by historians, but also, when they grow old, to extol the
days in which they remember their youth to have been spent. And
although this preference of theirs be in most instances a mistaken one,
I can see that there are many causes to account for it; chief of which
I take to be that in respect of things long gone by we perceive not the
whole truth, those circumstances that would detract from the credit of
the past being for the most part hidden from us, while all that gives
it lustre is magnified and embellished. For the generality of writers
render this tribute to the good fortune of conquerors, that to make
their achievements seem more splendid, they not merely exaggerate the
great things they have done, but also lend such a colour to the actions
of their enemies, that any one born afterwards, whether in the
conquering or in the conquered country, has cause to marvel at these
men and these times, and is constrained to praise and love them beyond
all others.

Again, men being moved to hatred either by fear or envy, these two most
powerful causes of dislike are cancelled in respect of things which are
past, because what is past can neither do us hurt, nor afford occasion
for envy. The contrary, however, is the case with the things we see,
and in which we take part; for in these, from our complete acquaintance
with them, no part of them being hidden from us, we recognize, along
with much that is good, much that displeases us, and so are forced to
pronounce them far inferior to the old, although in truth they deserve
far greater praise and admiration. I speak not, here, of what relates
to the arts, which have such distinction inherent in them, that time
can give or take from them but little of the glory which they merit of
themselves. I speak of the lives and manners of men, touching which the
grounds for judging are not so clear.

I repeat, then, that it is true that this habit of blaming and praising
obtains, but not always true that it is wrong applied. For sometimes it
will happen that this judgment is just; because, as human affairs are
in constant movement, it must be that they either rise or fall.
Wherefore, we may see a city or province furnished with free
institutions by some great and wise founder, flourish for a while
through his merits, and advance steadily on the path of improvement.
Any one born therein at that time would be in the wrong to praise the
past more than the present, and his error would be occasioned by the
causes already noticed. But any one born afterwards in that city or
province when the time has come for it to fall away from its former
felicity, would not be mistaken in praising the past.

When I consider how this happens, I am persuaded that the world,
remaining continually the same, has in it a constant quantity of good
and evil; but that this good and this evil shift about from one country
to another, as we know that in ancient times empire shifted from one
nation to another, according as the manners of these nations changed,
the world, as a whole, continuing as before, and the only difference
being that, whereas at first Assyria was made the seat of its
excellence, this was afterwards placed in Media, then in Persia, until
at last it was transferred to Italy and Rome. And although after the
Roman Empire, none has followed which has endured, or in which the
world has centred its whole excellence, we nevertheless find that
excellence diffused among many valiant nations, the kingdom of the
Franks, for example, that of the Turks, that of the Soldan, and the
States of Germany at the present day; and shared at an earlier time by
that sect of the Saracens who performed so many great achievements and
gained so wide a dominion, after destroying the Roman Empire in the
East.

In all these countries, therefore, after the decline of the Roman
power, and among all these races, there existed, and in some part of
them there yet exists, that excellence which alone is to be desired and
justly to be praised. Wherefore, if any man being born in one of these
countries should exalt past times over present, he might be mistaken;
but any who, living at the present day in Italy or Greece, has not in
Italy become an ultramontane or in Greece a Turk, has reason to
complain of his own times, and to commend those others, in which there
were many things which made them admirable; whereas, now, no regard
being had to religion, to laws, or to arms, but all being tarnished
with every sort of shame, there is nothing to redeem the age from the
last extremity of wretchedness, ignominy, and disgrace. And the vices
of our age are the more odious in that they are practised by those who
sit on the judgment seat, govern the State, and demand public
reverence.

But, returning to the matter in hand, it may be said, that if the
judgment of men be at fault in pronouncing whether the present age or
the past is the better in respect of things whereof, by reason of their
antiquity, they cannot have the same perfect knowledge which they have
of their own times, it ought not to be at fault in old men when they
compare the days of their youth with those of their maturity, both of
which have been alike seen and known by them. This were indeed true, if
men at all periods of their lives judged of things in the same way, and
were constantly influenced by the same desires; but since they alter,
the times, although they alter not, cannot but seem different to those
who have other desires, other pleasures, and other ways of viewing
things in their old age from those they had in their youth. For since,
when they grow old, men lose in bodily strength but gain in wisdom and
discernment, it must needs be that those things which in their youth
seemed to them tolerable and good, should in their old age appear
intolerable and evil. And whereas they should ascribe this to their
judgment, they lay the blame upon the times.

But, further, since the desires of men are insatiable, Nature prompting
them to desire all things and Fortune permitting them to enjoy but few,
there results a constant discontent in their minds, and a loathing of
what they possess, prompting them to find fault with the present,
praise the past, and long for the future, even though they be not moved
thereto by any reasonable cause.

I know not, therefore, whether I may not deserve to be reckoned in the
number of those who thus deceive themselves, if, in these Discourses of
mine, I render excessive praise to the ancient times of the Romans
while I censure our own. And, indeed, were not the excellence which
then prevailed and the corruption which prevails now clearer than the
sun, I should proceed more guardedly in what I have to say, from fear
lest in accusing others I should myself fall into this self-deception.
But since the thing is so plain that every one sees it, I shall be bold
to speak freely all I think, both of old times and of new, in order
that the minds of the young who happen to read these my writings, may
be led to shun modern examples, and be prepared to follow those set by
antiquity whenever chance affords the opportunity. For it is the duty
of every good man to teach others those wholesome lessons which the
malice of Time or of Fortune has not permitted him to put in practice;
to the end, that out of many who have the knowledge, some one better
loved by Heaven may be found able to carry them out.

Having spoken, then, in the foregoing Book of the various methods
followed by the Romans in regulating the domestic affairs of their
city, in this I shall speak of what was done by them to spread their
Empire.




CHAPTER I.—_Whether the Empire acquired by the Romans was more due to
Valour or to Fortune_.


Many authors, and among others that most grave historian Plutarch, have
thought that in acquiring their empire the Romans were more beholden to
their good fortune than to their valour; and besides other reasons
which they give for this opinion, they affirm it to be proved by the
admission of the Romans themselves, since their having erected more
temples to Fortune than to any other deity, shows that it was to her
that they ascribed their success. It would seem, too, that Titus Livius
was of the same mind, since he very seldom puts a speech into the mouth
of any Roman in which he discourses of valour, wherein he does not also
make mention of Fortune. This, however, is an opinion with which I can
in no way concur, and which, I take it, cannot be made good. For if no
commonwealth has ever been found to grow like the Roman, it is because
none was ever found so well fitted by its institutions to make that
growth. For by the valour of her armies she spread her empire, while by
her conduct of affairs, and by other methods peculiar to herself and
devised by her first founder, she was able to keep what she acquired,
as shall be fully shown in many of the following Discourses.

The writers to whom I have referred assert that it was owing to their
good fortune and not to their prudence that the Romans never had two
great wars on their hands at once; as, for instance, that they waged no
wars with the Latins until they had not merely overcome the Samnites,
but undertook in their defence the war on which they then entered; nor
ever fought with the Etruscans until they had subjugated the Latins,
and had almost worn out the Samnites by frequent defeats; whereas, had
any two of these powers, while yet fresh and unexhausted, united
together, it may easily be believed that the ruin of the Roman Republic
must have followed. But to whatsoever cause we ascribe it, it never so
chanced that the Romans engaged in two great wars at the same time. On
the contrary, it always seemed as though on the breaking out of one
war, another was extinguished; or that on the termination of one,
another broke out. And this we may plainly see from the order in which
their wars succeeded one another.

For, omitting those waged by them before their city was taken by the
Gauls, we find that during their struggle with the Equians and the
Volscians, and while these two nations continued strong, no others rose
against them. On these being subdued, there broke out the war with the
Samnites; and although before the close of that contest the Latin
nations had begun to rebel against Rome, nevertheless, when their
rebellion came to a head, the Samnites were in league with Rome, and
helped her with their army to quell the presumption of the rebels; on
whose defeat the war with Samnium was renewed.

When the strength of Samnium had been drained by repeated reverses,
there followed the war with the Etruscans; which ended, the Samnites
were once more stirred to activity by the coming of Pyrrhus into Italy.
When he, too, had been defeated, and sent back to Greece, Rome entered
on her first war with the Carthaginians; which was no sooner over than
all the Gallic nations on both sides of the Alps combined against the
Romans, by whom, in the battle fought between Populonia and Pisa, where
now stands the fortress of San Vincenzo, they were at last routed with
tremendous slaughter.

This war ended, for twenty years together the Romans were engaged in no
contest of importance, their only adversaries being the Ligurians, and
the remnant of the Gallic tribes who occupied Lombardy; and on this
footing things continued down to the second Carthaginian war, which for
sixteen years kept the whole of Italy in a blaze. This too being
brought to a most glorious termination, there followed the Macedonian
war, at the close of which succeeded the war with Antiochus and Asia.
These subdued, there remained not in the whole world, king or people
who either singly or together could withstand the power of Rome.

But even before this last victory, any one observing the order of these
wars, and the method in which they were conducted, must have recognized
not only the good fortune of the Romans, but also their extraordinary
valour and prudence. And were any one to search for the causes of this
good fortune, he would have little difficulty in finding them, since
nothing is more certain than that when a potentate has attained so
great a reputation that every neighbouring prince or people is afraid
to engage him single-handed, and stands in awe of him, none will ever
venture to attack him, unless driven to do so by necessity; so that it
will almost rest on his will to make war as he likes on any of his
neighbours, while he studiously maintains peace with the rest; who, on
their part, whether through fear of his power, or deceived by the
methods he takes to dull their vigilance, are easily kept quiet.
Distant powers, in the mean time, who have no intercourse with either,
treat the matter as too remote to concern them in any way; and abiding
in this error until the conflagration approaches their own doors, on
its arrival have no resource for its extinction, save in their own
strength, which, as their enemy has by that time become exceedingly
powerful, no longer suffices.

I forbear to relate how the Samnites stood looking on while the Romans
were subjugating the Equians and the Volscians; and, to avoid being
prolix, shall content myself with the single instance of the
Carthaginians, who, at the time when the Romans were contending with
the Samnites and Etruscans, were possessed of great power and held in
high repute, being already masters of the whole of Africa together with
Sicily and Sardinia, besides occupying territory in various parts of
Spain. And because their empire was so great, and at such a distance
from the Roman frontier, they were never led to think of attacking the
Romans or of lending assistance to the Etruscans or Samnites. On the
contrary, they behaved towards the Romans as men behave towards those
whom they see prosper, rather taking their part and courting their
friendship. Nor did they discover their mistake until the Romans, after
subduing all the intervening nations, began to assail their power both
in Spain and Sicily. What happened in the case of the Carthaginians,
happened also in the case of the Gauls, of Philip of Macedon, and of
Antiochus, each of whom, while Rome was engaged with another of them,
believed that other would have the advantage, and that there would be
time enough to provide for their own safety, whether by making peace or
war. It seems to me, therefore, that the same good fortune which, in
this respect, attended the Romans, might be shared by all princes
acting as they did, and of a valour equal to theirs.

As bearing on this point, it might have been proper for me to show what
methods were followed by the Romans in entering the territories of
other nations, had I not already spoken of this at length in my
_Treatise on Princedoms_, wherein the whole subject is discussed. Here
it is enough to say briefly, that in a new province they always sought
for some friend who should be to them as a ladder whereby to climb, a
door through which to pass, or an instrument wherewith to keep their
hold. Thus we see them effect their entrance into Samnium through the
Capuans, into Etruria through the Camertines, into Sicily through the
Mamertines, into Spain through the Saguntans, into Africa through
Massinissa, into Greece through the Etolians, into Asia through Eumenes
and other princes, into Gaul through the Massilians and Eduans; and, in
like manner, never without similar assistance in their efforts whether
to acquire provinces or to keep them.

The nations who carefully attend to this precaution will be seen to
stand in less need of Fortune’s help than others who neglect it. But
that all may clearly understand how much more the Romans were aided by
valour than by Fortune in acquiring their empire, I shall in the
following Chapter consider the character of those nations with whom
they had to contend, and show how stubborn these were in defending
their freedom.




CHAPTER II.—_With what Nations the Romans had to contend, and how
stubborn these were in defending their Freedom._


In subduing the countries round about them, and certain of the more
distant provinces, nothing gave the Romans so much trouble, as the love
which in those days many nations bore to freedom, defending it with
such obstinacy as could not have been overcome save by a surpassing
valour. For we know by numberless instances, what perils these nations
were ready to face in their efforts to maintain or recover their
freedom, and what vengeance they took against those who deprived them
of it. We know, too, from history, what hurt a people or city suffers
from servitude. And though, at the present day, there is but one
province which can be said to contain within it free cities, we find
that formerly these abounded everywhere. For we learn that in the
ancient times of which I speak, from the mountains which divide Tuscany
from Lombardy down to the extreme point of Italy, there dwelt numerous
free nations, such as the Etruscans, the Romans, and the Samnites,
besides many others in other parts of the Peninsula. Nor do we ever
read of there being any kings over them, except those who reigned in
Rome, and Porsenna, king of Etruria. How the line of this last-named
prince came to be extinguished, history does not inform us; but it is
clear that at the time when the Romans went to besiege Veii, Etruria
was free, and so greatly rejoiced in her freedom, and so detested the
regal name, that when the Veientines, who for their defence had created
a king in Veii, sought aid from the Etruscans against Rome, these,
after much deliberation resolved to lend them no help while they
continued to live under a king; judging it useless to defend a country
given over to servitude by its inhabitants.

It is easy to understand whence this love of liberty arises among
nations, for we know by experience that States have never signally
increased, either as to dominion or wealth, except where they have
lived under a free government. And truly it is strange to think to what
a pitch of greatness Athens came during the hundred years after she had
freed herself from the despotism of Pisistratus; and far stranger to
contemplate the marvellous growth which Rome made after freeing herself
from her kings. The cause, however, is not far to seek, since it is the
well-being, not of individuals, but of the community which makes a
State great; and, without question, this universal well-being is
nowhere secured save in a republic. For a republic will do whatsoever
makes for its interest; and though its measures prove hurtful to this
man or to that, there are so many whom they benefit, that these are
able to carry them out, in spite of the resistance of the few whom they
injure.

But the contrary happens in the case of a prince; for, as a rule, what
helps him hurts the State, and what helps the State hurts him; so that
whenever a tyranny springs up in a city which has lived free, the least
evil which can befall that city is to make no further progress, nor
ever increase in power or wealth; but in most cases, if not in all, it
will be its fate to go back. Or should there chance to arise in it some
able tyrant who extends his dominions by his valour and skill in arms,
the advantage which results is to himself only, and not to the State;
since he can bestow no honours on those of the citizens over whom he
tyrannizes who have shown themselves good and valiant, lest afterwards
he should have cause to fear them. Nor can he make those cities which
he acquires, subject or tributary to the city over which he rules;
because to make this city powerful is not for his interest, which lies
in keeping it so divided that each town and province may separately
recognize him alone as its master. In this way he only, and not his
country, is the gainer by his conquests. And if any one desire to have
this view confirmed by numberless other proofs, let him look into
Xenophon’s treatise _De Tirannide_.

No wonder, then, that the nations of antiquity pursued tyrants with
such relentless hatred, and so passionately loved freedom that its very
name was dear to them, as was seen when Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero
the Syracusan, was put to death in Syracuse. For when word of his death
reached the army, which lay encamped not far off, at first it was
greatly moved, and eager to take up arms against the murderers. But on
hearing the cry of liberty shouted in the streets of Syracuse, quieted
at once by the name, it laid aside its resentment against those who had
slain the tyrant, and fell to consider how a free government might be
provided for the city.

Nor is it to be wondered at that the ancient nations took terrible
vengeance on those who deprived them of their freedom; of which, though
there be many instances, I mean only to cite one which happened in the
city of Corcyra at the time of the Peloponnesian war. For Greece being
divided into two factions, one of which sided with the Athenians, the
other with the Spartans, it resulted that many of its cities were
divided against themselves, some of the citizens seeking the friendship
of Sparta and some of Athens. In the aforesaid city of Corcyra, the
nobles getting the upper hand, deprived the commons of their freedom;
these, however, recovering themselves with the help of the Athenians,
laid hold of the entire body of the nobles, and cast them into a prison
large enough to contain them all, whence they brought them forth by
eight or ten at a time, pretending that they were to be sent to
different places into banishment, whereas, in fact, they put them to
death with many circumstances of cruelty. Those who were left, learning
what was going on, resolved to do their utmost to escape this
ignominious death, and arming themselves with what weapons they could
find, defended the door of their prison against all who sought to
enter; till the people, hearing the tumult and rushing in haste to the
prison, dragged down the roof, and smothered the prisoners in the
ruins. Many other horrible and atrocious cruelties likewise perpetrated
in Greece, show it to be true that a lost freedom is avenged with more
ferocity than a threatened freedom is defended.

When I consider whence it happened that the nations of antiquity were
so much more zealous in their love of liberty than those of the present
day, I am led to believe that it arose from the same cause which makes
the present generation of men less vigorous and daring than those of
ancient times, namely the difference of the training of the present day
from that of earlier ages; and this, again, arises from the different
character of the religions then and now prevailing. For our religion,
having revealed to us the truth and the true path, teaches us to make
little account of worldly glory; whereas, the Gentiles, greatly
esteeming it, and placing therein their highest good, displayed a
greater fierceness in their actions.

This we may gather from many of their customs, beginning with their
sacrificial rites, which were of much magnificence as compared with the
simplicity of our worship, though that be not without a certain dignity
of its own, refined rather than splendid, and far removed from any
tincture of ferocity or violence. In the religious ceremonies of the
ancients neither pomp nor splendour were wanting; but to these was
joined the ordinance of sacrifice, giving occasion to much bloodshed
and cruelty. For in its celebration many beasts were slaughtered, and
this being a cruel spectacle imparted a cruel temper to the
worshippers. Moreover, under the old religions none obtained divine
honours save those who were loaded with worldly glory, such as captains
of armies and rulers of cities; whereas our religion glorifies men of a
humble and contemplative, rather than of an active life. Accordingly,
while the highest good of the old religions consisted in magnanimity,
bodily strength, and all those other qualities which make men brave,
our religion places it in humility, lowliness, and contempt for the
things of this world; or if it ever calls upon us to be brave, it is
that we should be brave to suffer rather than to do.

This manner of life, therefore, seems to have made the world feebler,
and to have given it over as a prey to wicked men to deal with as they
please; since the mass of mankind, in the hope of being received into
Paradise, think more how to bear injuries than how to avenge them. But
should it seem that the world has grown effeminate and Heaven laid
aside her arms, this assuredly results from the baseness of those who
have interpreted our religion to accord with indolence and ease rather
than with valour. For were we to remember that religion permits the
exaltation and defence of our country, we would see it to be our duty
to love and honour it, and would strive to be able and ready to defend
it.

This training, therefore, and these most false interpretations are the
causes why, in the world of the present day, we find no longer the
numerous commonwealths which were found of old; and in consequence,
that we see not now among the nations that love of freedom which
prevailed then; though, at the same time, I am persuaded that one cause
of this change has been, that the Roman Empire by its arms and power
put an end to all the free States and free institutions of antiquity.
For although the power of Rome fell afterwards into decay, these States
could never recover their strength or resume their former mode of
government, save in a very few districts of the Empire.

But, be this as it may, certain it is that in every country of the
world, even the least considerable, the Romans found a league of
well-armed republics, most resolute in the defence of their freedom,
whom it is clear they never could have subdued had they not been
endowed with the rarest and most astonishing valour. To cite a single
instance, I shall take the case of the Samnites who, strange as it may
now seem, were on the admission of Titus Livius himself, so powerful
and so steadfast in arms, as to be able to withstand the Romans down to
the consulship of Papirius Cursor, son to the first Papirius, a period
of six and forty years, in spite of numerous defeats, the loss of many
of their towns, and the great slaughter which overtook them everywhere
throughout their country. And this is the more remarkable when we see
that country, which once contained so many noble cities, and supported
so great a population, now almost uninhabited; and reflect that it
formerly enjoyed a government and possessed resources making its
conquest impossible to less than Roman valour.

There is no difficulty, therefore, in determining whence that ancient
greatness and this modern decay have arisen, since they can be traced
to the free life formerly prevailing and to the servitude which
prevails now. For all countries and provinces which enjoy complete
freedom, make, as I have said, most rapid progress. Because, from
marriage being less restricted in these countries, and more sought
after, we find there a greater population; every man being disposed to
beget as many children as he thinks he can rear, when he has no anxiety
lest they should be deprived of their patrimony, and knows not only
that they are born to freedom and not to slavery, but that they may
rise by their merit to be the first men of their country. In such
States, accordingly, we see wealth multiply, both that which comes from
agriculture and that which comes from manufactures. For all love to
gather riches and to add to their possessions when their enjoyment of
them is not likely to be disturbed. And hence it happens that the
citizens of such States vie with one another in whatever tends to
promote public or private well-being; in both of which, consequently,
there is a wonderful growth.

But the contrary of all this takes place in those countries which live
in servitude, and the more oppressive their servitude, the more they
fall short of the good which all desire. And the hardest of all hard
servitudes is that wherein one commonwealth is subjected to another.
First, because it is more lasting, and there is less hope to escape
from it; and, second, because every commonwealth seeks to add to its
own strength by weakening and enfeebling all beside. A prince who gets
the better of you will not treat you after this fashion, unless he be a
barbarian like those eastern despots who lay countries waste and
destroy the labours of civilization; but if influenced by the ordinary
promptings of humanity, will, as a rule, regard all his subject States
with equal favour, and suffer them to pursue their usual employments,
and retain almost all their ancient institutions, so that if they
flourish not as free States might, they do not dwindle as States that
are enslaved; by which I mean enslaved by a stranger, for of that other
slavery to which they may be reduced by one of their own citizens, I
have already spoken.

Whoever, therefore, shall well consider what has been said above, will
not be astonished at the power possessed by the Samnites while they
were still free, nor at the weakness into which they fell when they
were subjugated. Of which change in their fortunes Livius often reminds
us, and particularly in connection with the war with Hannibal, where he
relates that the Samnites, being ill-treated by a Roman legion
quartered at Nola, sent legates to Hannibal to ask his aid; who in
laying their case before him told him, that with their own soldiers and
captains they had fought single handed against the Romans for a hundred
years, and had more than once withstood two consuls and two consular
armies; but had now fallen so low, that they were scarce able to defend
themselves against one poor legion.




CHAPTER III.—_That Rome became great by destroying the Cities which lay
round about her, and by readily admitting strangers to the rights of
Citizenship._


“Crescit interea Roma Albæ ruinis”—_Meanwhile Rome grows on the ruins
of Alba_. They who would have their city become a great empire, must
endeavour by every means to fill it with inhabitants; for without a
numerous population no city can ever succeed in growing powerful. This
may be effected in two ways, by gentleness or by force. By gentleness,
when you offer a safe and open path to all strangers who may wish to
come and dwell in your city, so as to encourage them to come there of
their own accord; by force, when after destroying neighbouring towns,
you transplant their inhabitants to live in yours. Both of these
methods were practised by Rome, and with such success, that in the time
of her sixth king there dwelt within her walls eighty thousand citizens
fit to bear arms. For the Romans loved to follow the methods of the
skilful husbandman, who, to insure a plant growing big and yielding and
maturing its fruit, cuts off the first shoots it sends out, that the
strength remaining in the stem, it may in due season put forth new and
more vigorous and more fruitful branches. And that this was a right and
a necessary course for Rome to take for establishing and extending her
empire, is proved by the example of Sparta and Athens, which, although
exceedingly well-armed States, and regulated by excellent laws, never
reached the same greatness as the Roman Republic; though the latter, to
all appearance, was more turbulent and disorderly than they, and, so
far as laws went, not so perfectly governed. For this we can offer no
other explanation than that already given. For by augmenting the
numbers of her citizens in both the ways named, Rome was soon able to
place two hundred and eighty thousand men under arms; while neither
Sparta nor Athens could ever muster more than twenty thousand; and
this, not because the situation of these countries was less
advantageous than that of Rome, but simply from the difference in the
methods they followed.

For Lycurgus, the founder of the Spartan Republic, thinking nothing so
likely to relax his laws as an admixture of new citizens, did all he
could to prevent intercourse with strangers; with which object, besides
refusing these the right to marry, the right of citizenship, and all
such other social rights as induce men to become members of a
community, he ordained that in this republic of his the only money
current should be of leather, so that none might be tempted to repair
thither to trade or to carry on any art.

Under such circumstances the number of the inhabitants of that State
could never much increase. For as all our actions imitate nature, and
it is neither natural nor possible that a puny stem should carry a
great branch, so a small republic cannot assume control over cities or
countries stronger than herself; or, doing so, will resemble the tree
whose boughs being greater than its trunk, are supported with
difficulty, and snapped by every gust of wind. As it proved with
Sparta. For after she had spread her dominion over all the cities of
Greece, no sooner did Thebes rebel than all the others rebelled
likewise, and the trunk was left stripped of its boughs. But this could
not have happened with Rome, whose stem was mighty enough to bear any
branch with ease.

It was, therefore, by adding to her population, and by, adopting
certain other methods presently to be noticed, that Rome became so
great and powerful. And this is well expressed by Titus Livius, in the
words, “_Crescit interea Roma Albae ruinis_.”




CHAPTER IV.—_That Commonwealths have followed three Methods for
extending their Power_.


Any one who has read ancient history with attention, must have observed
that three methods have been used by republics for extending their
power. One of these, followed by the old Etruscans, is to form a
confederation of many States, wherein none has precedence over the rest
in authority or rank, and each allows the others to share its
acquisitions; as do the States of the Swiss League in our days, and as
the Achaians and Etolians did in Greece in earlier times. And because
the Etruscans were opposed to the Romans in many wars, that I may give
a clearer notion of this method of theirs, I shall enlarge a little in
my account of the Etruscan people.

In Italy, before the Romans became supreme, the Etruscans were very
powerful, both by sea and land; and although we have no separate
history of their affairs, we have some slight records left us of them,
and some indications of their greatness. We know, for instance, that
they planted a colony, to which they gave the name of Hadria, on the
coast of the upper sea; which colony became so renowned that it lent
its name to the sea itself, which to this day by the Latins is called
the Hadriatic. We know, too, that their arms were obeyed from the Tiber
to the foot of the mountains which enclose the greater part of the
Italian peninsula; although, two hundred years before Rome grew to any
great strength, they had lost their supremacy in the province now known
as Lombardy, of which the French had possessed themselves. For that
people, whether driven by necessity, or attracted by the excellence of
the fruits, and still more of the wine of Italy, came there under their
chief, Bellovesus; and after defeating and expelling the inhabitants of
the country, settled themselves therein, and there built many cities;
calling the district Gallia, after the name they then bore: and this
territory they retained until they were subdued by the Romans.

These Etruscans, therefore, living with one another on a footing of
complete equality, when they sought to extend their power, followed
that first method of which I have just now spoken. Their State was made
up of twelve cities, among which were Chiusi, Veii, Friuli, Arezzo,
Volterra, and the like, and their government was conducted in the form
of a league. They could not, however, extend their conquests beyond
Italy; while even within the limits of Italy, much territory remained
unoccupied by them for reasons presently to be noticed.

The second method is to provide yourself with allies or companions,
taking heed, however, to retain in your own hands the chief command,
the seat of government, and the titular supremacy. This was the method
followed by the Romans.

The third method is to hold other States in direct subjection to you,
and not merely associated with you as companions; and this was the plan
pursued by the Spartans and Athenians.

Of these three methods, the last is wholly useless, as was seen in the
case of the two States named, which came to ruin from no other cause
than that they had acquired a dominion greater than they could
maintain. For to undertake to govern cities by force, especially such
cities as have been used to live in freedom, is a difficult and arduous
task, in which you never can succeed without an army and that a great
one. But to have such an army you must needs have associates who will
help to swell the numbers of your own citizens. And because Athens and
Sparta neglected this precaution, whatever they did was done in vain;
whereas Rome, which offers an instance of the second of the methods we
are considering, by attending to this precaution reached a power that
had no limit. And as she alone has lived in this way, so she alone has
attained to this pitch of power. For joining with herself many States
throughout Italy as her companions, who in most respects lived with her
on a footing of equality, while, as has been noted, always reserving to
herself the seat of empire and the titular command, it came about that
these States, without being aware of it, by their own efforts, and with
their own blood, wrought out their own enslavement.

For when Rome began to send armies out of Italy, for the purpose of
reducing foreign kingdoms to provinces, and of subjugating nations who,
being used to live under kings, were not impatient of her yoke, and
who, receiving Roman governors, and having been conquered by armies
bearing the Roman name, recognized no masters save the Romans, those
companions of Rome who dwelt in Italy suddenly found themselves
surrounded by Roman subjects, and weighed down by the greatness of the
Roman power; and when at last they came to perceive the mistake in
which they had been living, it was too late to remedy it, so vast was
the authority which Rome had then obtained over foreign countries, and
so great the resources which she possessed within herself; having by
this time grown to be the mightiest and best-armed of States. So that
although these her companions sought to avenge their wrongs by
conspiring against her, they were soon defeated in the attempt, and
remained in a worse plight than before, since they too became subjects
and no longer associates. This method, then, as I have said, was
followed by the Romans alone; but no other plan can be pursued by a
republic which desires to extend its power; experience having shown
none other so safe and certain.

The method which consists in forming leagues, of which I have spoken
above as having been adopted by the Etruscans, the Achaians, and the
Etolians of old, and in our own days by the Swiss, is the next best
after that followed by the Romans, for as in this way there can be no
great extension of power, two advantages result: first, that you do not
readily involve yourself in war; and, second, that you can easily
preserve any little acquisition which you may make. The reason why you
cannot greatly extend your power is, that as your league is made up of
separate States with distinct seats of government, it is difficult for
these to consult and resolve in concert. The same causes make these
States careless to enlarge their territories; because acquisitions
which have to be shared among many communities are less thought of than
those made by a single republic which looks to enjoy them all to
itself. Again, since leagues govern through general councils, they must
needs be slower in resolving than a nation dwelling within one
frontier.

Moreover, we find from experience that this method has certain fixed
limits beyond which there is no instance of its ever having passed; by
which I mean that some twelve or fourteen communities may league
themselves together, but will never seek to pass beyond that limit: for
after associating themselves in such numbers as seem to them to secure
their safety against all besides, they desire no further extension of
their power, partly because no necessity compels them to extend, and
partly because, for the reasons already given, they would find no
profit in extending. For were they to seek extension they would have to
follow one of two courses: either continuing to admit new members to
their league, whose number must lead to confusion; or else making
subjects, a course which they will avoid since they will see difficulty
in making them, and no great good in having them. Wherefore, when their
number has so increased that their safety seems secured, they have
recourse to two expedients: either receiving other States under their
protection and engaging for their defence (in which way they obtain
money from various quarters which they can easily distribute among
themselves); or else hiring themselves out as soldiers to foreign
States, and drawing pay from this or the other prince who employs them
to carry out his enterprises; as we see done by the Swiss at the
present day, and as we read was done in ancient times by certain of
those nations whom we have named above. To which we have a witness in
Titus Livius, who relates that when Philip of Macedon came to treat
with Titus Quintius Flamininus, and while terms were being discussed in
the presence of a certain Etolian captain, this man coming to words
with Philip, the latter taunted him with greed and bad faith; telling
him that the Etolians were not ashamed to draw pay from one side, and
then send their men to serve on the other; so that often the banner of
Etolia might be seen displayed in two hostile camps.

We see, therefore, that the method of proceeding by leagues has always
been of the same character, and has led always to the same results. We
see, likewise, that the method which proceeds by reducing States to
direct subjection has constantly proved a weak one, and produced
insignificant gains; and that whenever these gains have passed a
certain limit, ruin has ensued. And if the latter of these two methods
be of little utility among armed States, among those that are unarmed,
as is now the case with the republics of Italy, it is worse than
useless. We may conclude, therefore, that the true method was that
followed by the Romans; which is the more remarkable as we find none
who adopted it before they did, and none who have followed it since. As
for leagues, I know of no nations who have had recourse to them in
recent times except the Swiss and the Suevians.

But to bring my remarks on this head to an end, I affirm that all the
various methods followed by the Romans in conducting their affairs,
whether foreign or domestic, so far from being imitated in our day,
have been held of no account, some pronouncing them to be mere fables,
some thinking them impracticable, others out of place and unprofitable;
and so, abiding in this ignorance, we rest a prey to all who have
chosen to invade our country. But should it seem difficult to tread in
the footsteps of the Romans, it ought not to appear so hard, especially
for us Tuscans, to imitate the Tuscans of antiquity, who if, from the
causes already assigned, they failed to establish an empire like that
of Rome, succeeded in acquiring in Italy that degree of power which
their method of acting allowed, and which they long preserved in
security, with the greatest renown in arms and government, and the
highest reputation for manners and religion. This power and this glory
of theirs were first impaired by the Gauls, and afterwards extinguished
by the Romans, and so utterly extinguished, that of the Etruscan
Empire, so splendid two thousand years ago, we have at the present day
barely a record. This it is which has led me to inquire whence this
oblivion of things arises, a question of which I shall treat in the
following Chapter.




CHAPTER V.—_That changes in Sects and Tongues, and the happening of
Floods and Pestilences, obliterate the Memory of the Past_.


To those philosophers who will have it that the world has existed from
all eternity, it were, I think, a good answer, that if what they say be
true we ought to have record of a longer period than five thousand
years; did it not appear that the memory of past times is blotted out
by a variety of causes, some referable to men, and some to Heaven.

Among the causes which have a human origin are the changes in sects and
tongues; because when a new sect, that is to say a new religion, comes
up, its first endeavour, in order to give itself reputation, is to
efface the old; and should it so happen that the founders of the new
religion speak another tongue, this may readily be effected. This we
know from observing the methods which Christianity has followed in
dealing with the religion of the Gentiles, for we find that it has
abolished all the rites and ordinances of that worship, and obliterated
every trace of the ancient belief. True, it has not succeeded in
utterly blotting out our knowledge of things done by the famous men who
held that belief; and this because the propagators of the new faith,
retaining the Latin tongue, were constrained to use it in writing the
new law; for could they have written this in a new tongue, we may
infer, having regard to their other persecutions, that no record
whatever would have survived to us of past events. For any one who
reads of the methods followed by Saint Gregory and the other heads of
the Christian religion, will perceive with what animosity they pursued
all ancient memorials; burning the works of poets and historians;
breaking images; and destroying whatsoever else afforded any trace of
antiquity. So that if to this persecution a new language had been
joined, it must soon have been found that everything was forgotten.

We may believe, therefore, that what Christianity has sought to effect
against the sect of the Gentiles, was actually effected by that sect
against the religion which preceded theirs; and that, from the repeated
changes of belief which have taken place in the course of five or six
thousand years, the memory of what happened at a remote date has
perished, or, if any trace of it remain, has come to be regarded as a
fable to which no credit is due; like the Chronicle of Diodorus
Siculus, which, professing to give an account of the events of forty or
fifty thousand years, is held, and I believe justly, a lying tale.

As for the causes of oblivion which we may refer to Heaven, they are
those which make havoc of the human race, and reduce the population of
certain parts of the world to a very small number. This happens by
plague, famine, or flood, of which three the last is the most hurtful,
as well because it is the most universal, as because those saved are
generally rude and ignorant mountaineers, who possessing no knowledge
of antiquity themselves, can impart none to those who come after them.
Or if among the survivors there chance to be one possessed of such
knowledge, to give himself consequence and credit, he will conceal and
pervert it to suit his private ends, so that to his posterity there
will remain only so much as he may have been pleased to communicate,
and no more.

That these floods, plagues, and famines do in fact happen, I see no
reason to doubt, both because we find all histories full of them, and
recognize their effect in this oblivion of the past, and also because
it is reasonable that such things should happen. For as when much
superfluous matter has gathered in simple bodies, nature makes repeated
efforts to remove and purge it away, thereby promoting the health of
these bodies, so likewise as regards that composite body the human
race, when every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that
they can neither subsist where they are nor remove elsewhere, every
region being equally crowded and over-peopled, and when human craft and
wickedness have reached their highest pitch, it must needs come about
that the world will purge herself in one or another of these three
ways, to the end that men, becoming few and contrite, may amend their
lives and live with more convenience.

Etruria, then, as has been said above, was at one time powerful,
abounding in piety and valour, practising her own customs, and speaking
her own tongue; but all this was effaced by the power of Rome, so that,
as I have observed already, nothing is left of her but the memory of a
name.




CHAPTER VI.—_Of the Methods followed by the Romans in making War_.


Having treated of the methods followed by the Romans for increasing
their power, we shall now go on to consider those which they used in
making war; and in all they did we shall find how wisely they turned
aside from the common path in order to render their progress to supreme
greatness easy.

Whosoever makes war, whether from policy or ambition, means to acquire
and to hold what he acquires, and to carry on the war he has undertaken
in such a manner that it shall enrich and not impoverish his native
country and State. It is necessary, therefore, whether for acquiring or
holding, to consider how cost may be avoided, and everything done most
advantageously for the public welfare. But whoever would effect all
this, must take the course and follow the methods of the Romans; which
consisted, first of all, in making their wars, as the French say,
_great and short_. For entering the field with strong armies, they
brought to a speedy conclusion whatever wars they had with the Latins,
the Samnites, or the Etruscans.

And if we take note of all the wars in which they were engaged, from
the foundation of their city down to the siege of Veii, all will be
seen to have been quickly ended some in twenty, some in ten, and some
in no more than six days. And this was their wont: So soon as war was
declared they would go forth with their armies to meet the enemy and at
once deliver battle. The enemy, on being routed, to save their country
from pillage, very soon came to terms, when the Romans would take from
them certain portions of their territory. These they either assigned to
particular persons, or made the seat of a colony, which being settled
on the confines of the conquered country served as a defence to the
Roman frontier, to the advantage both of the colonists who had these
lands given them, and of the Roman people whose borders were thus
guarded at no expense to themselves. And no other system of defence
could have been at once so safe, so strong, and so effectual. For while
the enemy were not actually in the field, this guard was sufficient;
and when they came out in force to overwhelm the colony, the Romans
also went forth in strength and gave them battle; and getting the
better of them, imposed harder terms than before, and so returned home.
And in this way they came gradually to establish their name abroad, and
to add to their power.

These methods they continued to employ until they changed their system
of warfare, which they did during the siege of Veii; when to enable
them to carry on a prolonged war, they passed a law for the payment of
their soldiers, whom, up to that time they had not paid, nor needed to
pay, because till then their wars had been of brief duration.
Nevertheless, while allowing pay to their soldiers that they might thus
wage longer wars, and keep their armies longer in the field when
employed on distant enterprises, they never departed from their old
plan of bringing their campaigns to as speedy an end as place and
circumstances allowed, nor ever ceased to plant colonies.

Their custom of terminating their wars with despatch, besides being
natural to the Romans, was strengthened by the ambition of their
consuls, who, being appointed for twelve months only, six of which they
had to spend in the city, were eager to bring their wars to an end as
rapidly as they could, that they might enjoy the honours of a triumph.
The usage of planting colonies was recommended by the great advantage
and convenience which resulted from it. In dealing with the spoils of
warfare their practice, no doubt, in a measure changed, so that in this
respect they were not afterwards so liberal as they were at first;
partly, because liberality did not seem so necessary when their
soldiers were in receipt of pay; and, partly, because the spoils
themselves being greater than before, they thought by their help so to
enrich the public treasury as to be able to carry on their wars without
taxing the city; and, in fact, by pursuing this course the public
revenues were soon greatly augmented. The methods thus followed by the
Romans in dividing plunder and in planting colonies had, accordingly,
this result, that whereas other less prudent princes and republics are
impoverished by war, Rome was enriched by it; nay, so far was the
system carried, that no consul could hope for a triumph unless he
brought back with him for the public treasury much gold and silver and
spoils of every kind.

By methods such as these, at one time bringing their wars to a rapid
conclusion by invasion and actual defeat, at another wearing out an
enemy by protracted hostilities, and again by concluding peace on
advantageous terms, the Romans continually grew richer and more
powerful.




CHAPTER VII.—_Of the Quantity of Land assigned by the Romans to each
Colonist_.


It would, I think, be difficult to fix with certainty how much land the
Romans allotted to each colonist, for my belief is that they gave more
or less according to the character of the country to which they sent
them. We may, however, be sure that in every instance, and to whatever
country they were sent, the quantity of land assigned was not very
large: first, because, these colonists being sent to guard the newly
acquired country, by giving little land it became possible to send more
men; and second because, as the Romans lived frugally at home, it is
unreasonable to suppose that they should wish their countrymen to be
too well off abroad. And Titus Livius tells us that on the capture of
Veii, the Romans sent thither a colony, allotting to each colonist
three jugera and seven unciae of land, which, according to our
measurement would be something under two acres.

Besides the above reasons, the Romans may likely enough have thought
that it was not so much the quantity of the land allotted as its
careful cultivation that would make it suffice. It is very necessary,
however, that every colony should have common pasturage where all may
send their cattle to graze, as well as woods where they may cut fuel;
for without such conveniences no colony can maintain itself.




CHAPTER VIII.—_Why certain Nations leave their ancestral Seats and
overflow the Countries of others_.


Having spoken above of the methods followed by the Romans in making
war, and related how the Etruscans were attacked by the Gauls, it seems
to me not foreign to these topics to explain that of wars there are two
kinds. One kind of war has its origin in the ambition of princes or
republics who seek to extend their dominions. Such were the wars waged
by Alexander the Great, and by the Romans, and such are those which we
see every day carried on by one potentate against another. Wars of this
sort have their dangers, but do not utterly extirpate the inhabitants
of a country; what the conqueror seeks being merely the submission of
the conquered people, whom, generally speaking, he suffers to retain
their laws, and always their houses and goods.

The other species of war is when an entire people, with all the
families of which it is made up, being driven out by famine or defeat,
removes from its former seat, and goes in search of a new abode and a
new country, not simply with the view to establish dominion over it,
but to possess it as its own, and to expel or exterminate the former
inhabitants. Of this most terrible and cruel species of warfare Sallust
speaks at the end of his history of the war with Jugurtha, where in
mentioning that after the defeat of Jugurtha the movement of the Gauls
into Italy began to be noticed, he observes that “_in the wars of the
Romans with other nations the struggle was for mastery; but that always
in their wars with the Gauls the struggle on both sides was for life_.”
For a prince or commonwealth, when attacking another State, will be
content to rid themselves of those only who are at the head of affairs;
but an entire people, set in motion in the manner described, must
destroy all who oppose them, since their object is to subsist on that
whereon those whom they invade have hitherto subsisted.

The Romans had to pass through three of these desperate wars; the first
being that in which their city was actually captured by those Gauls
who, as already mentioned, had previously taken Lombardy from the
Etruscans and made it their seat, and for whose invasion Titus Livius
has assigned two causes. First, that they were attracted, as I have
said before, by the fruitful soil and by the wine of Italy which they
had not in Gaul; second, that their population having multiplied so
greatly that they could no longer find wherewithal to live on at home,
the princes of their land decided that certain of their number should
go forth to seek a new abode; and so deciding, chose as leaders of
those who were to go, two Gaulish chiefs, Bellovesus and Siccovesus;
the former of whom came into Italy while the latter passed into Spain.
From the immigration under Bellovesus resulted the occupation of
Lombardy, and, subsequently, the first war of the Gauls with Rome. At a
later date, and after the close of the first war with Carthage, came
the second Gallic invasion, when more than two hundred thousand Gauls
perished in battle between Piombino and Pisa. The third of these wars
broke out on the descent into Italy of the Todi and Cimbri, who, after
defeating several Roman armies, were themselves defeated by Marius.

In these three most dangerous contests the arms of Rome prevailed; but
no ordinary valour was needed for their success. For we see afterwards,
when the spirit of the Romans had declined, and their armies had lost
their former excellence, their supremacy was overthrown by men of the
same race, that is to say by the Goths, the Vandals, and others like
them, who spread themselves over the whole of the Western Empire.

Nations such as these, quit, as I have said, their native land, when
forced by famine, or by defeat in domestic wars, to seek a new
habitation elsewhere. When those thus driven forth are in large
numbers, they violently invade the territories of other nations,
slaughtering the inhabitants, seizing on their possessions, founding
new kingdoms, and giving new names to provinces; as was done by Moses,
and by those tribes who overran the Roman Empire. For the new names
which we find in Italy and elsewhere, have no other origin than in
their having been given by these new occupants; as when the countries
formerly known as Gallia Cisalpina and Gallia Transalpina took the
names of Lombardy and France, from the Lombards and the Franks who
settled themselves there. In the same way Sclavonia was formerly known
as Illyria, Hungary as Pannonia, and England as Britain; while many
other provinces which it would be tedious to enumerate, have similarly
changed their designations; as when the name Judæa was given by Moses
to that part of Syria of which he took possession.

And since I have said above that nations such as those I have been
describing, are often driven by wars from their ancestral homes, and
forced to seek a new country elsewhere, I shall cite the instance of
the Maurusians, a people who anciently dwelt in Syria, but hearing of
the inroad of the Hebrews, and thinking themselves unable to resist
them, chose rather to seek safety in flight than to perish with their
country in a vain effort to defend it. For which reason, removing with
their families, they went to Africa, where, after driving out the
native inhabitants, they took up their abode; and although they could
not defend their own country, were able to possess themselves of a
country belonging to others. And Procopius, who writes the history of
the war which Belisarius conducted against those Vandals who seized on
Africa, relates, that on certain pillars standing in places where the
Maurusians once dwelt, he had read inscriptions in these words: “_We
Maurusians who fled before Joshua, the robber, the son of Nun_;”[7]
giving us to know the cause of their quitting Syria. Be this as it may,
nations thus driven forth by a supreme necessity, are, if they be in
great number, in the highest degree dangerous, and cannot be
successfully withstood except by a people who excel in arms.

 [7] Nos Maurusii qui fugimus a facie Jesu latronis filii Navæ.
 _Procop. Hist. Bell. Vand. II._


When those constrained to abandon their homes are not in large numbers,
they are not so dangerous as the nations of whom I have been speaking,
since they cannot use the same violence, but must trust to their
address to procure them a habitation; and, after procuring it, must
live with their neighbours as friends and companions, as we find Æneas,
Dido, the Massilians, and others like them to have lived; all of whom
contrived to maintain themselves in the districts in which they
settled, by securing the good will of the neighbouring nations.

Almost all the great emigrations of nations have been and continue to
be from the cold and barren region of Scythia, because from the
population there being excessive, and the soil ill able to support
them, they are forced to quit their home, many causes operating to
drive them forth and none to keep them back. And if, for the last five
hundred years, it has not happened that any of these nations has
actually overrun another country, there are various reasons to account
for it. First, the great clearance which that region made of its
inhabitants during the decline of the Roman Empire, when more than
thirty nations issued from it in succession; and next, the circumstance
that the countries of Germany and Hungary, whence also these nations
came, are now so much improved that men can live there in comfort, and
consequently are not constrained to shift their habitations. Besides
which, since these countries are occupied by a very warlike race, they
serve as a sort of bulwark to keep back the neighbouring Scythians, who
for this reason do not venture to attack them, nor attempt to force a
passage. Nevertheless, movements on a great scale have oftentimes been
begun by the Tartars, and been at once withstood by the Hungarians and
Poles, whose frequent boast it is, that but for them, Italy and the
Church would more than once have felt the weight of the Tartar arms.

Of the nations of whom I have been speaking, I shall now say no more.




CHAPTER IX.—_Of the Causes which commonly give rise to Wars between
States_.


The occasion which led to war between the Romans and Samnites, who for
long had been in league with one another, is of common occurrence in
all powerful States, being either brought about by accident, or else
purposely contrived by some one who would set war a-foot. As between
the Romans and the Samnites, the occasion of war was accidental. For in
making war upon the Sidicinians and afterwards on the Campanians, the
Samnites had no thought of involving themselves with the Romans. But
the Campanians being overpowered, and, contrary to the expectation of
Romans and Samnites alike, resorting to Rome for aid, the Romans, on
whose protection they threw themselves, were forced to succour them as
dependants, and to accept a war which, it seemed to them, they could
not with honour decline. For though they might have thought it
unreasonable to be called on to defend the Campanians as friends
against their own friends the Samnites, it seemed to them shameful not
to defend them as subjects, or as a people who had placed themselves
under their protection. For they reasoned that to decline their defence
would close the gate against all others who at any future time might
desire to submit themselves to their power. And, accordingly, since
glory and empire, and not peace, were the ends which they always had in
view, it became impossible for them to refuse this protectorship.

A similar circumstance gave rise to the first war with the
Carthaginians, namely the protectorate assumed by the Romans of the
citizens of Messina in Sicily, and this likewise came about by chance.
But the second war with Carthage was not the result of chance. For
Hannibal the Carthaginian general attacked the Saguntans, who were the
friends of Rome in Spain, not from any desire to injure them, but in
order to set the arms of Rome in motion, and so gain an opportunity of
engaging the Romans in a war, and passing on into Italy. This method of
picking a quarrel is constantly resorted to by powerful States when
they are bound by scruples of honour or like considerations. For if I
desire to make war on a prince with whom I am under an ancient and
binding treaty, I shall find some colour or pretext for attacking the
friend of that prince, very well knowing that when I attack his friend,
either the prince will resent it, when my scheme for engaging him in
war will be realized; or that, should he not resent it, his weakness or
baseness in not defending one who is under his protection will be made
apparent; either of which alternatives will discredit him, and further
my designs.

We are to note, therefore, in connection with this submission of the
Campanians, what has just now been said as to provoking another power
to war; and also the remedy open to a State which, being unequal to its
own defence, is prepared to go all lengths to ruin its assailant,—that
remedy being to give itself up unreservedly to some one whom it selects
for its defender; as the Campanians gave themselves up to the Romans,
and as the Florentines gave themselves up to King Robert of Naples,
who, after refusing to defend them as his friends against Castruccio of
Lucca by whom they were hard pressed, defended them as his subjects.




CHAPTER X.—_That contrary to the vulgar opinion, Money is not the
Sinews of War_.


Since any man may begin a war at his pleasure, but cannot at his
pleasure bring it to a close, a prince before he engages in any warlike
enterprise ought to measure his strength and govern himself
accordingly. But he must be prudent enough not to deceive himself as to
his strength, which he will always do, if he measure it by money, by
advantage of position, or by the good-will of his subjects, while he is
unprovided with an army of his own. These are things which may swell
your strength but do not constitute it, being in themselves null and of
no avail without an army on which you can depend.

Without such an army no amount of money will meet your wants, the
natural strength of your country will not protect you, and the fidelity
and attachment of your subjects will not endure, since it is impossible
that they should continue true to you when you cannot defend them.
Lakes, and mountains, and the most inaccessible strongholds, where
valiant defenders are wanting, become no better than the level plain;
and money, so far from being a safeguard, is more likely to leave you a
prey to your enemy; since nothing can be falser than the vulgar opinion
which affirms it to be the sinews of war.

This opinion is put forward by Quintus Curtius, where, in speaking of
the war between Antipater the Macedonian and the King of Sparta, he
relates that the latter, from want of money, was constrained to give
battle and was defeated; whereas, could he have put off fighting for a
few days the news of Alexander’s death would have reached Greece, and
he might have had a victory without a battle. But lacking money, and
fearing that on that account his soldiers might desert him, he was
forced to hazard an engagement. It was for this reason that Quintus
Curtius declared money to be the sinews of war, a maxim every day cited
and acted upon by princes less wise than they should be. For building
upon this, they think it enough for their defence to have laid up great
treasures; not reflecting that were great treasures all that is needed
for victory, Darius of old had conquered Alexander, the Greeks the
Romans, and in our own times Charles of Burgundy the Swiss; while the
pope and the Florentines together would have had little difficulty in
defeating Francesco Maria, nephew of Pope Julius II., in the recent war
of Urbino; and yet, in every one of these instances, the victory
remained with him who held the sinews of war to consist, not in money,
but in good soldiers.

Croesus, king of Lydia, after showing Solon the Athenian much besides,
at last displayed to him the boundless riches of his treasure-house,
and asked him what he thought of his power. Whereupon Solon answered
that he thought him no whit more powerful in respect of these
treasures, for as war is made with iron and not with gold, another
coming with more iron might carry off his gold. After the death of
Alexander the Great a tribe of Gauls, passing through Greece on their
way into Asia, sent envoys to the King of Macedonia to treat for terms
of accord; when the king, to dismay them by a display of his resources,
showed them great store of gold and silver. But these barbarians, when
they saw all this wealth, in their greed to possess it, though before
they had looked on peace as settled, broke off negotiations; and thus
the king was ruined by those very treasures he had amassed for his
defence. In like manner, not many years ago, the Venetians, with a full
treasury, lost their whole dominions without deriving the least
advantage from their wealth.

I maintain, therefore, that it is not gold, as is vulgarly supposed,
that is the sinews of war, but good soldiers; or while gold by itself
will not gain you good soldiers, good soldiers may readily get you
gold. Had the Romans chosen to make war with gold rather than with iron
all the treasures of the earth would not have sufficed them having
regard to the greatness of their enterprises and the difficulties they
had to overcome in carrying them out. But making their wars with iron
they never felt any want of gold; for those who stood in fear of them
brought gold into their camp.

And supposing it true that the Spartan king was forced by lack of money
to risk the chances of a battle, it only fared with him in respect of
money as it has often fared with others from other causes; since we see
that where an army is in such straits for want of victual that it must
either fight or perish by famine, it will always fight, as being the
more honourable course and that on which fortune may in some way smile.
So, too, it has often happened that a captain, seeing his enemy about
to be reinforced, has been obliged either to trust to fortune and at
once deliver battle, or else, waiting till the reinforcement is
complete, to fight then, whether he will or no, and at whatever
disadvantage. We find also, as in the case of Hasdrubal when beset, in
the March of Ancona, at once by Claudius Nero and by the other Roman
consul, that a captain, when he must either fight or fly, will always
fight, since it will seem to him that by this course, however
hazardous, he has at least a chance of victory, while by the other his
ruin is certain.

There are many circumstances, therefore, which may force a captain to
give battle contrary to his intention, among which the want of money
may sometimes be one. But this is no ground for pronouncing money to be
the sinews of war, any more than those other things from the want of
which men are reduced to the same necessity. Once more, therefore, I
repeat that not gold but good soldiers constitute the sinews of war.
Money, indeed, is most necessary in a secondary place; but this
necessity good soldiers will always be able to supply, since it is as
impossible that good soldiers should lack money, as that money by
itself should secure good soldiers. And that what I say is true is
shown by countless passages in history. When Pericles persuaded the
Athenians to declare war against the whole Peloponnesus, assuring them
that their dexterity, aided by their wealth, was sure to bring them off
victorious, the Athenians, though for a while they prospered in this
war, in the end were overpowered, the prudent counsels and good
soldiers of Sparta proving more than a match for the dexterity and
wealth of Athens. But, indeed, there can be no better witness to the
truth of my contention than Titus Livius himself. For in that passage
of his history wherein he discusses whether if Alexander the Great had
invaded Italy, he would have succeeded in vanquishing the Romans, three
things are noted by him as essential to success in war; to wit, many
and good soldiers, prudent captains, and favourable fortune; and after
examining whether the Romans or Alexander would have had the advantage
in each of these three particulars, he arrives at his conclusion
without any mention of money.

The Campanians, therefore, when asked by the Sidicinians to arm in
their behalf, must have measured their strength by wealth and not by
soldiers; for after declaring in their favour and suffering two
defeats, to save themselves they were obliged to become tributary to
Rome.




CHAPTER XI.—_That it were unwise to ally yourself a Prince who has
Reputation rather than Strength._


To mark the mistake made by the Sidicinians in trusting to the
protection of the Campanians, and by the Campanians in supposing
themselves able to protect the Sidicinians, Titus Livius could not have
expressed himself in apter words than by saying, that “_the Campanians
rather lent their name to the Sidicinians than furnished any
substantial aid towards their defence._”

Here we have to note that alliances with princes who from dwelling at a
distance have no facility, or who from their own embarrassments, or
from other causes, have no ability to render aid, afford rather
reputation than protection to those who put their trust in them. As was
the case in our own times with the Florentines, when, in the year 1479,
they were attacked by the Pope and the King of Naples. For being
friends of the French king they drew from that friendship more
reputation than help. The same would be the case with that prince who
should engage in any enterprise in reliance on the Emperor Maximilian,
his being one of those friendships which, in the words of our
historian, _nomen magis quam praesidium adferunt_.

On this occasion, therefore, the Campanians were misled by imagining
themselves stronger than they really were. For often, from defect of
judgment, men take upon them to defend others, when they have neither
skill nor ability to defend themselves. Of which we have a further
instance in the Tarentines, who, when the Roman and Samnite armies were
already drawn up against one another for battle, sent messengers to the
Roman consul to acquaint him that they desired peace between the two
nations, and would themselves declare war against whichsoever of the
two first began hostilities. The consul, laughing at their threats, in
the presence of the messengers, ordered the signal for battle to sound,
and bade his army advance to meet the enemy; showing the Tarentines by
acts rather than words what answer he thought their message deserved.

Having spoken in the present Chapter of unwise courses followed by
princes for defending others, I shall speak in the next, of the methods
they follow in defending themselves.




CHAPTER XII.—_Whether when Invasion is imminent it is better to
anticipate or to await it._


I have often heard it disputed by men well versed in military affairs,
whether, when there are two princes of nearly equal strength, and the
bolder of the two proclaims war upon the other, it is better for that
other to await attack within his own frontier, or to march into the
enemy’s country and fight him there; and I have heard reasons given in
favour of each of these courses.

They who maintain that an enemy should be attacked in his own country,
cite the advice given by Croesus to Cyrus, when the latter had come to
the frontiers of the Massagetæ to make war on that people. For word
being sent by Tomyris their queen that Cyrus might, at his pleasure,
either enter her dominions, where she would await him, or else allow
her to come and meet him; and the matter being debated, Croesus,
contrary to the opinion of other advisers, counselled Cyrus to go
forward and meet the queen, urging that were he to defeat her at a
distance from her kingdom, he might not be able to take it from her,
since she would have time to repair her strength; whereas, were he to
defeat her within her own dominions, he could follow her up on her
flight, and, without giving her time to recover herself, deprive her of
her State. They cite also the advice given by Hannibal to Antiochus,
when the latter was meditating a war on the Romans. For Hannibal told
him that the Romans could not be vanquished except in Italy, where an
invader might turn to account the arms and resources of their friends,
whereas any one making war upon them out of Italy, and leaving that
country in their hands, would leave them an unfailing source whence to
draw whatever reinforcement they might need; and finally, he told him,
that the Romans might more easily be deprived of Rome than of their
empire, and of Italy more easily than of any of their other provinces.
They likewise instance Agathocles, who, being unequal to support a war
at home, invaded the Carthaginians, by whom he was being attacked, and
reduced them to sue for peace. They also cite Scipio, who to shift the
war from Italy, carried it into Africa.

Those who hold a contrary opinion contend that to have your enemy at a
disadvantage you must get him away from his home, alleging the case of
the Athenians, who while they carried on the war at their convenience
in their own territory, retained their superiority; but when they
quitted that territory, and went with their armies to Sicily, lost
their freedom. They cite also the fable of the poets wherein it is
figured that Antæus, king of Libya, being assailed by the Egyptian
Hercules, could not be overcome while he awaited his adversary within
the bounds of his own kingdom; but so soon as he was withdrawn from
these by the craft of Hercules, lost his kingdom and his life. Whence
the fable runs that Antæus, being son to the goddess Earth, when thrown
to the ground drew fresh strength from the Earth, his mother; and that
Hercules, perceiving this, held him up away from the Earth.

Recent opinions are likewise cited as favouring this view. Every one
knows how Ferrando, king of Naples, was in his day accounted a most
wise prince; and how two years before his death there came a rumour
that Charles VIII of France was meditating an attack upon him; and how,
after making great preparations for his defence, he sickened; and being
on the point of death, among other counsels left his son Alfonso this
advice, that nothing in the world should tempt him to pass out of his
own territory, but to await the enemy within his frontier, and with his
forces unimpaired; a warning disregarded by Alfonso, who sent into
Romagna an army, which he lost, and with it his whole dominions,
without a battle.

Other arguments on both sides of the question in addition to those
already noticed, are as follows: He who attacks shows higher courage
than he who stands on his defence, and this gives his army greater
confidence. Moreover, by attacking your enemy you deprive him of many
opportunities for using his resources, since he can receive no aid from
subjects who have been stripped of their possessions; and when an enemy
is at his gates, a prince must be careful how he levies money and
imposes taxes; so that, as Hannibal said, the springs which enable a
country to support a war come to be dried up. Again, the soldiers of an
invader, finding themselves in a foreign land, are under a stronger
necessity to fight, and necessity, as has often been said, is the
parent of valour.

On the other hand, it may be argued that there are many advantages to
be gained by awaiting the attack of your enemy. For without putting
yourself much about, you may harass him by intercepting his supplies,
whether of victual or of whatsoever else an army stands in need: from
your better knowledge of the country you can impede his movements; and
because men muster more willingly to defend their homes than to go on
distant expeditions, you can meet him with more numerous forces, if
defeated you can more easily repair your strength, because the bulk of
your army, finding shelter at hand, will be able to save itself, and
your reserves will have no distance to come. In this way you can use
your whole strength without risking your entire fortunes; whereas, in
leaving your country, you risk your entire fortunes, without putting
forth your whole strength. Nay, we find that to weaken an adversary
still further, some have suffered him to make a march of several days
into their country, and then to capture certain of their towns, that by
leaving garrisons in these, he might reduce the numbers of his army,
and so be attacked at greater disadvantage.

But now to speak my own mind on the matter, I think we should make this
distinction. Either you have your country strongly defended, as the
Romans had and the Swiss have theirs, or, like the Carthaginians of old
and the King of France and the Italians at the present day, you have it
undefended. In the latter case you must keep the enemy at a distance
from your country, for as your strength lies not in men but in money,
whenever the supply of money is cut off you are undone, and nothing so
soon cuts off this supply as a war of invasion. Of which we have
example in the Carthaginians, who, while their country was free from
invasion, were able by means of their great revenues to carry on war in
Italy against the Romans, but when they were invaded could not defend
themselves even against Agathocles. The Florentines, in like manner,
could make no head against Castruccio, lord of Lucca, when he attacked
them in their own country; and to obtain protection, were compelled to
yield themselves up to King Robert of Naples. And yet, after
Castruccio’s death, these same Florentines were bold enough to attack
the Duke of Milan in his own country, and strong enough to strip him of
his dominions. Such valour did they display in distant wars, such
weakness in those that were near.

But when a country is armed as Rome was and Switzerland now is, the
closer you press it, the harder it is to subdue; because such States
can assemble a stronger force to resist attack than for attacking
others. Nor does the great authority of Hannibal move me in this
instance, since resentment and his own advantage might lead him to
speak as he spoke to Antiochus. For had the Romans suffered in Gaul,
and within the same space of time, those three defeats at the hands of
Hannibal which they suffered in Italy, it must have made an end of
them; since they could not have turned the remnants of their armies to
account as they did in Italy, not having the same opportunity for
repairing their strength; nor could they have met their enemy with such
numerous armies. For we never find them sending forth a force of more
than fifty thousand men for the invasion of any province; whereas, in
defending their own country against the inroad of the Gauls at the end
of the first Carthaginian war, we hear of them bringing some eighteen
hundred thousand men into the field; and their failure to vanquish the
Gauls in Lombardy as they had vanquished those in Tuscany arose from
their inability to lead a great force so far against a numerous enemy,
or to encounter him with the same advantages. In Germany the Cimbrians
routed a Roman army who had there no means to repair their disaster;
but when they came into Italy, the Romans could collect their whole
strength, and destroy them. Out of their native country, whence they
can bring no more than thirty or forty thousand men, the Swiss may
readily be defeated; but in their own country, where they can assemble
a hundred thousand, they are well-nigh invincible.

In conclusion, therefore, I repeat that the prince who has his people
armed and trained for war, should always await a great and dangerous
war at home, and never go forth to meet it. But that he whose subjects
are unarmed, and whose country is not habituated to war, should always
carry the war to as great a distance as he can from home. For in this
way each will defend himself in the best manner his means admit.




CHAPTER XIII.—_That Men rise from humble to high Fortunes rather by
Fraud than by Force._


I hold it as most certain that men seldom if ever rise to great place
from small beginnings without using fraud or force, unless, indeed,
they be given, or take by inheritance the place to which some other has
already come. Force, however, will never suffice by itself to effect
this end, while fraud often will, as any one may plainly see who reads
the lives of Philip of Macedon, Agathocles of Sicily, and many others
like them, who from the lowest or, at any rate, from very low
beginnings, rose either to sovereignty or to the highest command.

This necessity for using deceit is taught by Xenophon in his life of
Cyrus; for the very first expedition on which Cyrus is sent, against
the King of Armenia, is seen to teem with fraud; and it is by fraud,
and not by force, that he is represented as having acquired his
kingdom; so that the only inference to be drawn from his conduct, as
Xenophon describes it, is, that the prince who would accomplish great
things must have learned how to deceive. Xenophon, moreover, represents
his hero as deceiving his maternal grandsire Cyaxares, king of the
Medians, in a variety of ways; giving it to be understood that without
such deceit he could not have reached the greatness to which he came.
Nor do I believe that any man born to humble fortunes can be shown to
have attained great station, by sheer and open force, whereas this has
often been effected by mere fraud, such as that used by Giovanni
Galeazzo to deprive his uncle Bernabo of the State and government of
Lombardy.

The same arts which princes are constrained to use at the outset of
their career, must also be used by commonwealths, until they have grown
powerful enough to dispense with them and trust to strength alone. And
because Rome at all times, whether from chance or choice, followed all
such methods as are necessary to attain greatness, in this also she was
not behindhand. And, to begin with, she could have used no greater
fraud than was involved in her method above noticed, of making for
herself companions; since under this name she made for herself
subjects, for such the Latins and the other surrounding nations, in
fact, became. For availing herself at first of their arms to subdue
neighbouring countries and gain herself reputation as a State, her
power was so much increased by these conquests that there was none whom
she could not overcome. But the Latins never knew that they were
enslaved until they saw the Samnites twice routed and forced to make
terms. This success, while it added greatly to the fame of the Romans
among princes at a distance, who were thereby made familiar with the
Roman name though not with the Roman arms, bred at the same time
jealousy and distrust among those who, like the Latins, both saw and
felt these arms; and such were the effects of this jealousy and
distrust, that not the Latins only but all the Roman colonies in
Latium, along with the Campanians whom a little while before the Romans
had defended leagued themselves together against the authority of Rome.
This war was set on foot by the Latins in the manner in which, as I
have already explained, most wars are begun, not by directly attacking
the Romans, but by defending the Sidicinians against the Samnites who
were making war upon them with the permission of the Romans. And that
it was from their having found out the crafty policy of the Romans that
the Latins were led to take this step, is plain from the words which
Titus Livius puts in the mouth of Annius Setinus the Latin prætor, who,
in addressing the Latin council, is made to say, “_For if even now we
can put up with slavery under the disguise of an equal alliance, etc_”

We see, therefore, that the Romans, from the time they first began to
extend their power, were not unfamiliar with the art of deceiving, an
art always necessary for those who would mount to great heights from
low beginnings; and which is the less to be condemned when, as in the
case of the Romans, it is skilfully concealed.




CHAPTER XIV.—_That Men often err in thinking they can subdue Pride by
Humility._


You shall often find that humility is not merely of no service to you,
but is even hurtful, especially when used in dealing with insolent men,
who, through envy or other like cause, have conceived hatred against
you. Proof whereof is supplied by our historian where he explains the
causes of this war between the Romans and the Latins. For on the
Samnites complaining to the Romans that the Latins had attacked them,
the Romans, desiring not to give the Latins ground of offence, would
not forbid them proceeding with the war. But the endeavour to avoid
giving offence to the Latins only served to increase their confidence,
and led them the sooner to declare their hostility. Of which we have
evidence in the language used by the same Latin Prætor, Annius Setinus,
at the aforesaid council, when he said:—“_You have tried their patience
by refusing them, soldiers. Who doubts but that they are offended?
Still they have put up with the affront. They have heard that we are
assembling an army against their allies the Samnites; and yet they have
not stirred from their city. Whence this astonishing forbearance, but
from their knowing our strength and their own weakness_?” Which words
give us clearly to understand how much the patience of the Romans
increased the arrogance of the Latins.

A prince, therefore, should never stoop from his dignity, nor should he
if he would have credit for any concession make it voluntarily, unless
he be able or believe himself able to withhold it. For almost always
when matters have come to such a pass that you cannot give way with
credit it is better that a thing be taken from you by force than
yielded through fear of force. For if you yield through fear and to
escape war, the chances are that you do not escape it; since he to
whom, out of manifest cowardice you make this concession, will not rest
content, but will endeavour to wring further concessions from you, and
making less account of you, will only be the more kindled against you.
At the same time you will find your friends less zealous on your
behalf, since to them you will appear either weak or cowardly. But if,
so soon as the designs of your enemy are disclosed, you at once prepare
to resist though your strength be inferior to his, he will begin to
think more of you, other neighbouring princes will think more; and many
will be willing to assist you, on seeing you take up arms, who, had you
relinquished hope and abandoned yourself to despair, would never have
stirred a finger to save you.

The above is to be understood as applying where you have a single
adversary only; but should you have several, it will always be a
prudent course, even after war has been declared, to restore to some
one of their number something you have of his, so as to regain his
friendship and detach him from the others who have leagued themselves
against you.




CHAPTER XV.—That weak States are always dubious in their Resolves; and
that tardy Resolves are always hurtful.


Touching this very matter, and with regard to these earliest beginnings
of war between the Latins and the Romans, it may be noted, that in all
our deliberations it behoves us to come quickly to a definite resolve,
and not to remain always in dubiety and suspense. This is plainly seen
in connection with the council convened by the Latins when they thought
to separate themselves from the Romans. For the Romans suspecting the
hostile humour wherewith the Latins were infected, in order to learn
how things really stood, and see whether they could not win back the
malcontents without recourse to arms, gave them to know that they must
send eight of their citizens to Rome, as they had occasion to consult
with them. On receiving which message the Latins, knowing that they had
done many things contrary to the wishes of the Romans, called a council
to determine who of their number should be sent, and to instruct them
what they were to say. But Annius, their prætor, being present in the
council when these matters were being discussed, told them “_that he
thought it of far greater moment for them to consider what they were to
do than what they were to say; for when their resolves were formed, it
would be easy to clothe them in fit words_.” This, in truth, was sound
advice and such as every prince and republic should lay to heart.
Because, where there is doubt and uncertainty as to what we may decide
on doing, we know not how to suit our words to our conduct; whereas,
with our minds made up, and the course we are to follow fixed, it is an
easy matter to find words to declare our resolves. I have noticed this
point the more readily, because I have often found such uncertainty
hinder the public business of our own republic, to its detriment and
discredit. And in all matters of difficulty, wherein courage is needed
for resolving, this uncertainty will always be met with, whenever those
who have to deliberate and decide are weak.

Not less mischievous than doubtful resolves are those which are late
and tardy, especially when they have to be made in behalf of a friend.
For from their lateness they help none, and hurt ourselves. Tardy
resolves are due to want of spirit or want of strength, or to the
perversity of those who have to determine, who being moved by a secret
desire to overthrow the government, or to carry out some selfish
purpose of their own, suffer no decision to be come to, but only thwart
and hinder. Whereas, good citizens, even when they see the popular mind
to be bent on dangerous courses, will never oppose the adoption of a
fixed plan, more particularly in matters which do not brook delay.

After Hieronymus, the Syracusan tyrant, was put to death, there being
at that time a great war between the Romans and the Carthaginians, the
citizens of Syracuse fell to disputing among themselves with which
nation they should take part; and so fierce grew the controversy
between the partisans of the two alliances, that no course could be
agreed on, and they took part with neither; until Apollonides, one of
the foremost of the Syracusan citizens, told them in a speech replete
with wisdom, that neither those who inclined to hold by the Romans, nor
those who chose rather to side with the Carthaginians, were deserving
of blame; but that what was utterly to be condemned was doubt and delay
in taking one side or other; for from such uncertainty he clearly
foresaw the ruin of their republic; whereas, by taking a decided
course, whatever it might be, some good might come. Now Titus Livius
could not show more clearly than he does in this passage, the mischief
which results from resting in suspense. He shows it, likewise, in the
case of the Lavinians, of whom he relates, that being urged by the
Latins to aid them against Rome, they were so long in making up their
minds, that when the army which they at last sent to succour the Latins
was issuing from their gates, word came that the Latins were defeated.
Whereupon Millionius, their prætor, said, “_With the Romans this short
march will cost us dear_.” But had the Lavinians resolved at once
either to grant aid or to refuse it, taking a latter course they would
not have given offence to the Romans, taking the former, and rendering
timely help, they and the Latins together might have had a victory. But
by delay they stood to lose in every way, as the event showed.

This example, had it been remembered by the Florentines, might have
saved them from all that loss and vexation which they underwent at the
hands of the French, at the time King Louis XII. of France came into
Italy against Lodovico, duke of Milan. For when Louis first proposed to
pass through Tuscany he met with no objection from the Florentines,
whose envoys at his court arranged with him that they should stand
neutral, while the king, on his arrival in Italy, was to maintain their
government and take them under his protection; a month’s time being
allowed the republic to ratify these terms. But certain persons, who,
in their folly, favoured the cause of Lodovico, delayed this
ratification until the king was already on the eve of victory; when the
Florentines suddenly becoming eager to ratify, the king would not
accept their ratification, perceiving their consent to be given under
constraint and not of their own good-will. This cost the city of
Florence dear, and went near to lose her freedom, whereof she was
afterwards deprived on another like occasion. And the course taken by
the Florentines was the more to be blamed in that it was of no sort of
service to Duke Lodovico, who, had he been victorious, would have shown
the Florentines many more signs of his displeasure than did the king.

Although the hurt which results to republics from weakness of this sort
has already been discussed in another Chapter, nevertheless, since an
opportunity offered for touching upon it again, I have willingly
availed myself of it, because to me it seems a matter of which
republics like ours should take special heed.




CHAPTER XVI.—_That the Soldiers of our days depart widely from the
methods of ancient Warfare._


In all their wars with other nations, the most momentous battle ever
fought by the Romans, was that which they fought with the Latins when
Torquatus and Decius were consuls. For it may well be believed that as
by the loss of that battle the Latins became subject to the Romans, so
the Romans had they not prevailed must have become subject to the
Latins. And Titus Livius is of this opinion, since he represents the
armies as exactly equal in every respect, in discipline and in valour,
in numbers and in obstinacy, the only difference he draws being, that
of the two armies the Romans had the more capable commanders. We find,
however, two circumstances occurring in the conduct of this battle, the
like of which never happened before, and seldom since, namely, that to
give steadiness to the minds of their soldiers, and render them
obedient to the word of command and resolute to fight, one of the
consuls put himself, and the other his son, to death.

The equality which Titus Livius declares to have prevailed in these two
armies, arose from this, that having long served together they used the
same language, discipline, and arms; that in disposing their men for
battle they followed the same system; and that the divisions and
officers of their armies bore the same names. It was necessary,
therefore, that as they were of equal strength and valour, something
extraordinary should take place to render the courage of the one army
more stubborn and unflinching than that of the other, it being on this
stubbornness, as I have already said, that victory depends. For while
this temper is maintained in the minds of the combatants they will
never turn their backs on their foe. And that it might endure longer in
the minds of the Romans than of the Latins, partly chance, and partly
the valour of the consuls caused it to fall out that Torquatus slew his
son, and Decius died by his own hand.

In pointing out this equality of strength, Titus Livius takes occasion
to explain the whole system followed by the Romans in the ordering of
their armies and in disposing them for battle; and as he has treated
the subject at length, I need not go over the same ground, and shall
touch only on what I judge in it most to deserve attention, but, being
overlooked by all the captains of our times, has led to disorder in
many armies and in many battles.

From this passage of Titus Livius, then, we learn that the Roman army
had three principal divisions, or battalions as we might now call them,
of which they named the first _hastati_, the second _principes_, and
the third _triarii_, to each of which cavalry were attached. In
arraying an army for battle they set the _hastati_ in front. Directly
behind them, in the second rank, they placed the _principes_; and in
the third rank of the same column, the _triarii_. The cavalry of each
of these three divisions they disposed to the right and left of the
division to which it belonged; and to these companies of horse, from
their form and position, they gave the name wings (_alæ_), from their
appearing like the two wings of the main body of the army. The first
division, the _hastati_, which was in front, they drew up in close
order to enable it to withstand and repulse the enemy. The second
division, the _principes_, since it was not to be engaged from the
beginning, but was meant to succour the first in case that were driven
in, was not formed in close order but kept in open file, so that it
might receive the other into its ranks whenever it was broken and
forced to retire. The third division, that, namely, of the _triarii_,
had its ranks still more open than those of the second, so that, if
occasion required, it might receive the first two divisions of the
_hastati_ and _principes_. These divisions, therefore, being drawn up
in this order, the engagement began, and if the _hastati_ were
overpowered and driven back, they retired within the loose ranks of the
_principes_, when both these divisions, being thus united into one,
renewed the conflict. If these, again, were routed and forced back,
they retreated within the open ranks of the _triarii_, and all three
divisions, forming into one, once more renewed the fight, in which, if
they were overpowered, since they had no further means of recruiting
their strength, they lost the battle. And because whenever this last
division, of the _triarii_, had to be employed, the army was in
jeopardy, there arose the proverb, “_Res redacta est ad triarios_,”
equivalent to our expression of _playing a last stake_.

The captains of our day, as they have abandoned all the other customs
of antiquity, and pay no heed to any part of the ancient discipline, so
also have discarded this method of disposing their men, though it was
one of no small utility. For to insure the defeat of a commander who so
arranges his forces as to be able thrice during an engagement to renew
his strength, Fortune must thrice declare against him, and he must be
matched with an adversary able three times over to defeat him; whereas
he whose sole chance of success lies in his surviving the first onset,
as is the case with all the armies of Christendom at the present day,
may easily be vanquished, since any slight mishap, and the least
failure in the steadiness of his men, may deprive him of victory.

And what takes from our armies the capacity to renew their strength is,
that provision is now no longer made for one division being received
into the ranks of another, which happens because at present an army is
arranged for battle in one or other of two imperfect methods. For
either its divisions are placed side by side, so as to form a line of
great width but of no depth or solidity; or if, to strengthen it, it be
drawn up in columns after the fashion of the Roman armies, should the
front line be broken, no provision having been made for its being
received by the second, it is thrown into complete disorder, and both
divisions fall to pieces. For if the front line be driven back, it
jostles the second, if the second line endeavour to advance, the first
stands in its way: and thus, the first driving against the second, and
the second against the third, such confusion follows that often the
most trifling accident will cause the ruin of an entire army.

At the battle of Ravenna, where M. de Foix, the French commander, was
slain, although according to modern notions this was a well-fought
field, both the French and the Spanish armies were drawn up in the
first of the faulty methods above described; that is to say, each army
advanced with the whole of its battalions side by side, so that each
presented a single front much wider than deep; this being always the
plan followed by modern armies when, as at Ravenna, the ground is open.
For knowing the disorder they fall into on retreat, forming themselves
in a single line, they endeavour, as I have said, as much as possible
to escape confusion by extending their front. But where the ground
confines them they fall at once into the disorder spoken of, without an
effort to prevent it.

Troops traversing an enemy’s country, whether to pillage or carry out
any other operation of war, are liable to fall into the same disorder;
and at S. Regolo in the Pisan territory, and at other places where the
Florentines were beaten by the Pisans during the war which followed on
the revolt of Pisa after the coming of Charles of France into Italy,
our defeat was due to no other cause than the behaviour of our own
cavalry, who being posted in front, and being repulsed by the enemy,
fell back on the infantry and threw them into confusion, whereupon the
whole army took to flight; and Messer Ciriaco del Borgo, the veteran
leader of the Florentine foot, has often declared in my presence that
he had never been routed by any cavalry save those who were fighting on
his side. For which reason the Swiss, who are the greatest proficients
in modern warfare, when serving with the French, make it their first
care to place themselves on their flank, so that the cavalry of their
friends, if repulsed, may not throw them into disorder.

But although these matters seem easy to understand and not difficult to
put in practice, none has yet been found among the commanders of our
times, who attempted to imitate the ancients or to correct the moderns.
For although these also have a tripartite division of their armies into
van-guard, main-body, and rear-guard, the only use they make of it is
in giving orders when their men are in quarters; whereas on active
service it rarely happens that all divisions are not equally exposed to
the same onset.

And because many, to excuse their ignorance, will have it that the
destructive fire of artillery forbids our employing at the present day
many of the tactics used by the ancients, I will discuss this question
in the following Chapter, and examine whether artillery does in fact
prevent us from using the valiant methods of antiquity.




CHAPTER XVII.—_What importance the Armies of the present day should
allow to Artillery; and whether the commonly received opinion
concerning it be just._


Looking to the number of pitched battles, or what are termed by the
French _journées_, and by the Italians _fatti d’arme_, fought by the
Romans at divers times, I am led further to examine the generally
received opinion, that had artillery been in use in their day, the
Romans would not have been allowed, or at least not with the same ease,
to subjugate provinces and make other nations their tributaries, and
could never have spread their power in the astonishing way they did.
For it is said that by reason of these fire-arms men can no longer use
or display their personal valour as they could of old; that there is
greater difficulty now than there was in former times in joining
battle; that the tactics followed then cannot be followed now; and that
in time all warfare must resolve itself into a question of artillery.

Judging it not out of place to inquire whether these opinions are
sound, and how far artillery has added to or taken from the strength of
armies, and whether its use lessens or increases the opportunities for
a good captain to behave valiantly, I shall at once address myself to
the first of the averments noticed above, namely, that the armies of
the ancient Romans could not have made the conquests they did, had
artillery then been in use.

To this I answer by saying that, since war is made for purposes either
of offence or defence, we have first to see in which of these two kinds
of warfare artillery gives the greater advantage or inflicts the
greater hurt. Now, though something might be said both ways, I
nevertheless believe that artillery is beyond comparison more hurtful
to him who stands on the defensive than to him who attacks. For he who
defends himself must either do so in a town or in a fortified camp. If
within a town, either the town will be a small one, as fortified towns
commonly are, or it will be a great one. In the former case, he who is
on the defensive is at once undone. For such is the shock of artillery
that there is no wall so strong that in a few days it will not batter
down, when, unless those within have ample room to withdraw behind
covering works and trenches, they must be beaten; it being impossible
for them to resist the assault of an enemy who forces an entrance
through the breaches in their walls. Nor will any artillery a defender
may have be of any service to him; since it is an established axiom
that where men are able to advance in numbers and rapidly, artillery is
powerless to check them.

For this reason, in storming towns the furious assaults of the northern
nations prove irresistible, whereas the attacks of our Italian troops,
who do not rush on in force, but advance to the assault in small knots
of skirmishers (_scaramouches_, as they are fitly named), may easily be
withstood. Those who advance in such loose order, and with so little
spirit, against a breach covered by artillery, advance to certain
destruction, and as against them artillery is useful. But when the
assailants swarm to the breach so massed together that one pushes on
another, unless they be brought to a stand by ditches and earthworks,
they penetrate everywhere, and no artillery has any effect to keep them
back; and though some must fall, yet not so many as to prevent a
victory.

The frequent success of the northern nations in storming towns, and
more particularly the recovery of Brescia by the French, is proof
sufficient of the truth of what I say. For the town of Brescia rising
against the French while the citadel still held out, the Venetians, to
meet any attack which might be made from the citadel upon the town,
ranged guns along the whole line of road which led from the one to the
other, planting them in front, and in flank, and wherever else they
could be brought to bear. Of all which M. de Foix making no account,
dismounted with his men-at-arms from horseback, and, advancing with
them on foot through the midst of the batteries, took the town; nor do
we learn that he sustained any considerable loss from the enemy’s fire.
So that, as I have said, he who has to defend himself in a small town,
when his walls are battered down and he has no room to retire behind
other works, and has only his artillery to trust to, is at once undone.

But even where the town you defend is a great one, so that you have
room to fall back behind new works, artillery is still, by a long way,
more useful for the assailant than for the defender. For to enable your
artillery to do any hurt to those without, you must raise yourself with
it above the level of the ground, since, if you remain on the level,
the enemy, by erecting any low mound or earth-work, can so secure
himself that it will be impossible for you to touch him. But in raising
yourself above the level of the ground, whether by extending yourself
along the gallery of the walls, or otherwise, you are exposed to two
disadvantages; for, first, you cannot there bring into position guns of
the same size or range as he who is without can bring to bear against
you, since it is impossible to work large guns in a confined space;
and, secondly, although you should succeed in getting your guns into
position, you cannot construct such strong and solid works for their
protection as those can who are outside, and on level ground, and who
have all the room and every other advantage which they could desire. It
is consequently impossible for him who defends a town to maintain his
guns in position at any considerable height, when those who are outside
have much and powerful artillery; while, if he place it lower, it
becomes, as has been explained, to a great extent useless. So that in
the end the defence of the city has to be effected, as in ancient
times, by hand to hand fighting, or else by means of the smaller kinds
of fire-arms, from which if the defender derive some slight advantage,
it is balanced by the injury he sustains from the great artillery of
his enemy, whereby the walls of the city are battered down and almost
buried in their ditches; so that when it comes once more to an
encounter at close quarters, by reason of his walls being demolished
and his ditches filled up, the defender is now at a far greater
disadvantage than he was formerly. Wherefore I repeat that these arms
are infinitely more useful for him who attacks a town than for him who
defends it.

As to the remaining method, which consists in your taking up your
position in an entrenched camp, where you need not fight unless you
please, and unless you have the advantage, I say that this method
commonly affords you no greater facility for avoiding an engagement
than the ancients had; nay, that sometimes, owing to the use of
artillery, you are worse off than they were. For if the enemy fall
suddenly upon you, and have some slight advantage (as may readily be
the case from his being on higher ground, or from your works on his
arrival being still incomplete so that you are not wholly sheltered by
them), forthwith, and without your being able to prevent him, he
dislodges you, and you are forced to quit your defences and deliver
battle: as happened to the Spaniards at the battle of Ravenna. For
having posted themselves between the river Ronco and an earthwork, from
their not having carried this work high enough, and from the French
having a slight advantage of ground, they were forced by the fire of
the latter to quit their entrenchments come to an engagement.

But assuming the ground you have chosen for your camp to be, as it
always should, higher than that occupied by the enemy, and your works
to be complete and sufficient, so that from your position and
preparations the enemy dare not attack you, recourse will then be had
to the very same methods as were resorted to in ancient times when an
army was so posted that it could not be assailed; that is to say, your
country will be wasted, cities friendly to you besieged or stormed, and
your supplies intercepted; until you are forced, at last, of necessity
to quit your camp and to fight a pitched battle, in which, as will
presently appear, artillery will be of little service to you.

If we consider, therefore, for what ends the Romans made wars, and that
attack and not defence was the object of almost all their campaigns, it
will be clear, if what I have said be true, that they would have had
still greater advantage, and might have achieved their conquests with
even greater ease, had artillery been in use in their times.

And as to the second complaint, that by reason of artillery men can no
longer display their valour as they could in ancient days, I admit it
to be true that when they have to expose themselves a few at a time,
men run more risks now than formerly; as when they have to scale a town
or perform some similar exploit, in which they are not massed together
but must advance singly and one behind another. It is true, also, that
Captains and commanders of armies are subjected to a greater risk of
being killed now than of old, since they an be reached everywhere by
the enemy’s fire; and it is no protection to them to be with those of
their men who are furthest from the enemy, or to be surrounded by the
bravest of their guards. Still, we do not often find either of these
two dangers occasioning extraordinary loss. For towns strongly
fortified are not attacked by escalade, nor will the assailing army
advance against them in weak numbers; but will endeavour, as in ancient
times, to reduce them by regular siege. And even in the case of towns
attacked by storm, the dangers are not so very much greater now than
they were formerly; for in those old days also, the defenders of towns
were not without warlike engines, which if less terrible in their
operation, had, so far as killing goes, much the same effect. And as
for the deaths of captains and leaders of companies, it may be said
that during the last twenty-four years of war in Italy, we have had
fewer instances of such deaths than might be found in a period of ten
years of ancient warfare. For excepting the Count Lodovico della
Mirandola, who fell at Ferrara, when the Venetians a few years ago
attacked that city, and the Duke de Nemours, slain at Cirignuola, we
have no instance of any commander being killed by artillery. For, at
Ravenna, M. de Foix died by steel and not by shot. Wherefore I say that
if men no longer perform deeds of individual prowess, it results not so
much from the use of artillery, as from the faulty discipline and
weakness of our armies, which being collectively without valour cannot
display it in particular instances.

As to the third assertion, that armies can no longer be brought to
engage one another, and that war will soon come to be carried on wholly
with artillery, I maintain that this allegation is utterly untrue, and
will always be so held by those who are willing in handling their
troops to follow the usages of ancient valour. For whosoever would have
a good army must train it, either by real or by mimic warfare, to
approach the enemy, to come within sword-thrust, and to grapple with
him; and must rely more on foot soldiers than on horse, for reasons
presently to be explained. But when you trust to your foot-soldiers,
and to the methods already indicated, artillery becomes powerless to
harm you. For foot-soldiers, in approaching an enemy, can with more
ease escape the fire of his artillery than in ancient times they could
have avoided a charge of elephants or of scythed chariots, or any other
of those strange contrivances which had to be encountered by the
Romans, and against which they always devised some remedy. And,
certainly, as against artillery, their remedy would have been easier,
by as much as the time during which artillery can do hurt is shorter
than the time during which elephants and chariots could. For by these
you were thrown into disorder after battle joined, whereas artillery
harasses you only before you engage; a danger which infantry can easily
escape, either by advancing so as to be covered by the inequalities of
the ground, or by lying down while the firing continues; nay, we find
from experience that even these precautions may be dispensed with,
especially as against great artillery, which can hardly be levelled
with such precision that its fire shall not either pass over your head
from the range being too high, or fall short from its being too low.

So soon, however, as the engagement is begun, it is perfectly clear
that neither small nor great artillery can harm you any longer; since,
if the enemy have his artillerymen in front, you take them; if in rear,
they will injure him before they injure you; and if in flank, they can
never fire so effectively as to prevent your closing, with the result
already explained. Nor does this admit of much dispute, since we have
proof of it in the case of the Swiss at Novara, in the year 1513, when,
with neither guns nor cavalry, they advanced against the French army,
who had fortified themselves with artillery behind entrenchments, and
routed them without suffering the slightest check from their fire. In
further explanation whereof it is to be noted, that to work artillery
effectively it should be protected by walls, by ditches, or by
earth-works; and that whenever, from being left without such protection
it has to be defended by men, as happens in pitched battles and
engagements in the open field, it is either taken or otherwise becomes
useless. Nor can it be employed on the flank of an army, save in the
manner in which the ancients made use of their warlike engines, which
they moved out from their columns that they might be worked without
inconvenience, but withdrew within them when driven back by cavalry or
other troops. He who looks for any further advantage from artillery
does not rightly understand its nature, and trusts to what is most
likely to deceive him. For although the Turk, using artillery, has
gained victories over the Soldan and the Sofi, the only advantage he
has had from it has been the terror into which the horses of the enemy,
unused to such sounds, are thrown by the roar of the guns.

And now, to bring these remarks to a conclusion, I say briefly that,
employed by an army wherein there is some strain of the ancient valour,
artillery is useful; but employed otherwise, against a brave adversary,
is utterly useless.




CHAPTER XVIII.—_That the authority of the Romans and the example of
ancient Warfare should make us hold Foot Soldiers of more account than
Horse._


By many arguments and instances it can be clearly established that in
their military enterprises the Romans set far more store on their
infantry than on their cavalry, and trusted to the former to carry out
all the chief objects which their armies were meant to effect. Among
many other examples of this, we may notice the great battle which they
fought with the Latins near the lake Regillus, where to steady their
wavering ranks they made their horsemen dismount, and renewing the
combat on foot obtained a victory. Here we see plainly that the Romans
had more confidence in themselves when they fought on foot than when
they fought on horseback. The same expedient was resorted to by them in
many of their other battles, and always in their sorest need they found
it their surest stay.

Nor are we to condemn the practice in deference to the opinion of
Hannibal, who, at the battle of Cannæ, on seeing the consuls make the
horsemen dismount, said scoffingly, “_Better still had they delivered
their knights to me in chains._” For though this saying came from the
mouth of a most excellent soldier, still, if we are to regard
authority, we ought rather to follow the authority of a commonwealth
like Rome, and of the many great captains who served her, than that of
Hannibal alone. But, apart from authority, there are manifest reasons
to bear out what I say. For a man may go on foot into many places where
a horse cannot go; men can be taught to keep rank, and if thrown into
disorder to recover form; whereas, it is difficult to keep horses in
line, and impossible if once they be thrown into disorder to reform
them. Moreover we find that with horses as with men, some have little
courage and some much; and that often a spirited horse is ridden by a
faint-hearted rider, or a dull horse by a courageous rider, and that in
whatever way such disparity is caused, confusion and disorder result.
Again, infantry, when drawn up in column, can easily break and is not
easily broken by cavalry. This is vouched, not only by many ancient and
many modern instances, but also by the authority of those who lay down
rules for the government of States, who show that at first wars were
carried on by mounted soldiers, because the methods for arraying
infantry were not yet understood, but that so soon as these were
discovered, the superiority of foot over horse was at once recognized.
In saying this, I would not have it supposed that horsemen are not of
the greatest use in armies, whether for purposes of observation, for
harrying and laying waste the enemy’s country, for pursuing a
retreating foe or helping to repulse his cavalry. But the substance and
sinew of an army, and that part of it which ought constantly to be most
considered, should always be the infantry. And among sins of the
Italian princes who have made their country the slave of foreigners,
there is none worse than that they have held these arms in contempt,
and turned their whole attention to mounted troops.

This error is due to the craft of our captains and to the ignorance of
our rulers. For the control of the armies of Italy for the last five
and twenty years resting in the hands of men, who, as having no lands
of their own, may be looked on as mere soldiers of fortune, these fell
forthwith on contriving how they might maintain their credit by being
supplied with the arms which the princes of the country were without.
And as they had no subjects of their own of whom they could make use,
and could not obtain constant employment and pay for a large number of
foot-soldiers, and as a small number would have given them no
importance, they had recourse to horsemen. For a _condottiere_ drawing
pay for two or three hundred horsemen was maintained by them in the
highest credit, and yet the cost was not too great to be met by the
princes who employed him. And to effect their object with more ease,
and increase their credit still further, these adventurers would allow
no merit or favour to be due to foot-soldiers, but claimed all for
their horsemen. And to such a length was this bad system carried, that
in the very greatest army only the smallest sprinkling of infantry was
to be found. This, together with many other ill practices which
accompanied it, has so weakened the militia of Italy, that the country
has easily been trampled upon by all the nations of the North.

That it is a mistake to make more account of cavalry than of infantry,
may be still more clearly seen from another example taken from Roman
history. The Romans being engaged on the siege of Sora, a troop of
horse a sally from the town to attack their camp; when the Roman master
of the knights advancing with his own horsemen to give them battle, it
so chanced that, at the very first onset, the leaders on both sides
were slain. Both parties being thus left without commanders, and the
combat, nevertheless, continuing, the Romans thinking thereby to have
the advantage of their adversaries, alighted from horseback, obliging
the enemy’s cavalry, in order to defend themselves, to do the like. The
result was that the Romans had the victory. Now there could be no
stronger instance than this to show the superiority of foot over horse.
For while in other battles the Roman cavalry were made by their consuls
to dismount in order to succour their infantry who were in distress and
in need of such aid, on this occasion they dismounted, not to succour
their infantry, nor to encounter an enemy contending on foot, but
because they saw that though they could not prevail against the enemy
fighting as horsemen against horsemen, on foot they readily might. And
from this I conclude that foot-soldiers, if rightly handled, can hardly
be beaten except by other soldiers fighting on foot.

With very few cavalry, but with a considerable force of infantry, the
Roman commanders, Crassus and Marcus Antonius, each for many days
together overran the territories of the Parthians, although opposed by
the countless horsemen of that nation. Crassus, indeed, with the
greater part of his army, was left there dead, and Antonius only saved
himself by his valour; but even in the extremities to which the Romans
were then brought, see how greatly superior foot-soldiers are to horse.
For though fighting in an open country, far from the sea-coast, and cut
off from his supplies, Antonius proved himself a valiant soldier in the
judgment even of the Parthians themselves, the whole strength of whose
cavalry never ventured to attack the columns of his army. And though
Crassus perished there, any one who reads attentively the account of
his expedition must see that he was rather outwitted than defeated, and
that even when his condition was desperate, the Parthians durst not
close with him, but effected his destruction by hanging continually on
the flanks of his army, and intercepting his supplies, while cajoling
him with promises which they never kept.

It might, I grant, be harder to demonstrate this great superiority of
foot over horse, had we not very many modern examples affording the
clearest proof of it. For instance, at the battle of Novara, of which
we have already spoken, nine thousand Swiss foot were seen to attack
ten thousand cavalry together with an equal number of infantry, and to
defeat them; the cavalry being powerless to injure them, while of the
infantry, who were mostly Gascons, and badly disciplined, they made no
account. On another occasion we have seen twenty-six thousand Swiss
march on Milan to attack Francis I. of France, who had with him twenty
thousand men-at-arms, forty thousand foot, and a hundred pieces of
artillery; and although they were not victorious as at Novara, they
nevertheless fought valiantly for two days together, and, in the end,
though beaten, were able to bring off half their number. With
foot-soldiers only Marcus Attilius Regulus ventured to oppose himself,
not to cavalry merely, but to elephants; and if the attempt failed it
does not follow that he was not justified by the valour of his men in
believing them equal to surmount this danger.

I repeat, therefore, that to prevail against well-disciplined infantry,
you must meet them with infantry disciplined still better, and that
otherwise you advance to certain destruction. In the time of Filippo
Visconti, Duke of Milan, some sixteen thousand Swiss made a descent on
Lombardy, whereupon the Duke, who at that time had Il Carmagnola as his
captain, sent him with six thousand men-at-arms and a slender following
of foot-soldiers to meet them. Not knowing their manner of fighting,
Carmagnola fell upon them with his horsemen, expecting to put them at
once to rout; but finding them immovable, after losing many of his men
he withdrew. But, being a most wise captain, and skilful in devising
new remedies to meet unwonted dangers, after reinforcing his company he
again advanced to the attack; and when about to engage made all his
men-at-arms dismount, and placing them in front of his foot-soldiers,
fell once more upon the Swiss, who could then no longer withstand him.
For his men, being on foot and well armed, easily penetrated the Swiss
ranks without hurt to themselves; and getting among them, had no
difficulty in cutting them down, so that of the entire army of the
Swiss those only escaped who were spared by his humanity.

Of this difference in the efficiency of these two kinds of troops, many
I believe are aware; but such is the unhappiness and perversity of the
times in which we live, that neither ancient nor modern examples, nor
even the consciousness of error, can move our present princes to amend
their ways, or convince them that to restore credit to the arms of a
State or province, it is necessary to revive this branch of their
militia also, to keep it near them, to make much of it, and to give it
life, that in return, it may give back life and reputation to them. But
as they have departed from all those other methods already spoken of,
so have they departed from this, and with this result, that to them the
acquisition of territory is rather a loss than a gain, as presently
shall be shown.




CHAPTER XIX.—_That Acquisitions made by ill-governed States and such as
follow not the valiant methods of the Romans, tend rather to their Ruin
than to their Aggrandizement_.


To these false opinions, founded on the pernicious example first set by
the present corrupt age, we owe it, that no man thinks of departing
from the methods which are in use. It had been impossible, for
instance, some thirty years ago, to persuade an Italian that ten
thousand foot-soldiers could, on plain ground, attack ten thousand
cavalry together with an equal number of infantry; and not merely
attack, but defeat them; as we saw done by the Swiss at that battle of
Novara, to which I have already referred so often. For although history
abounds in similar examples, none would have believed them, or,
believing them, would have said that nowadays men are so much better
armed, that a squadron of cavalry could shatter a rock, to say nothing
of a column of infantry. With such false pleas would they have belied
their judgment, taking no account that with a very scanty force of
foot-soldiers, Lucullus routed a hundred and fifty thousand of the
cavalry of Tigranes, among whom were a body of horsemen very nearly
resembling our own men-at-arms. Now, however, this error is
demonstrated by the example of the northern nations.

And since what history teaches as to the superiority of foot-soldiers
is thus proved to be true, men ought likewise to believe that the other
methods practised by the ancients are in like manner salutary and
useful. And were this once accepted, both princes and commonwealths
would make fewer blunders than they do, would be stronger to resist
sudden attack, and would no longer place their sole hope of safety in
flight; while those who take in hand to provide a State with new
institutions would know better what direction to give them, whether in
the way of extending or merely of preserving; and would see that to
augment the numbers of their citizens, to assume other States as
companions rather than reduce them to subjection, to send out colonies
for the defence of acquired territories, to hold their spoils at the
credit of the common stock, to overcome enemies by inroads and pitched
battles rather than by sieges, to enrich the public purse, keep down
private wealth, and zealously, to maintain all military exercises, are
the true ways to aggrandize a State and to extend its empire. Or if
these methods for adding to their power are not to their mind, let them
remember that acquisitions made in any other way are the ruin of
republics, and so set bounds to their ambition, wisely regulating the
internal government of their country by suitable laws and ordinances,
forbidding extension, and looking only to defence, and taking heed that
their defences are in good order, as do those republics of Germany
which live and for long have lived, in freedom.

And yet, as I have said on another occasion, when speaking of the
difference between the methods suitable for acquiring and those
suitable for maintaining, it is impossible for a republic to remain
long in the peaceful enjoyment of freedom within a restricted frontier.
For should it forbear from molesting others, others are not likely to
refrain from molesting it; whence must grow at once the desire and the
necessity to make acquisitions; or should no enemies be found abroad,
they will be found at home, for this seems to be incidental to all
great States. And if the free States of Germany are, and have long been
able to maintain themselves on their present footing, this arises from
certain conditions peculiar to that country, and to be found nowhere
else, without which these communities could not go on living as they
do.

The district of Germany of which I speak was formerly subject to the
Roman Empire, in the same way as France and Spain; but on the decline
of the Empire, and when its very name came to be limited to this one
province, its more powerful cities taking advantage of the weakness and
necessities of the Emperors, began to free themselves by buying from
them their liberty, subject to the payment of a trifling yearly
tribute; until, gradually, all the cities which held directly from the
Emperor, and were not subject to any intermediate lord, had, in like
manner, purchased their freedom. While this went on, it so happened
that certain communities subject to the Duke of Austria, among which
were Friburg, the people of Schweitz, and the like, rose in rebellion
against him, and meeting at the outset with good success, by degrees
acquired such accession of strength that so far from returning under
the Austrian yoke, they are become formidable to all their neighbours
These are the States which we now name Swiss.

Germany is, consequently, divided between the Swiss, the communities
which take the name of Free Towns, the Princes, and the Emperor; and
the reason why, amid so many conflicting interests, wars do not break
out, or breaking out are of short continuance, is the reverence in
which all hold this symbol of the Imperial authority. For although the
Emperor be without strength of his own, he has nevertheless such credit
with all these others that he alone can keep them united, and,
interposing as mediator, can speedily repress by his influence any
dissensions among them.

The greatest and most protracted wars which have taken place in this
country have been those between the Swiss and the Duke of Austria; and
although for many years past the Empire and the dukedom of Austria have
been united in the same man, he has always failed to subdue the
stubbornness of the Swiss, who are never to be brought to terms save by
force. Nor has the rest of Germany lent the Emperor much assistance in
his wars with the Swiss, the Free Towns being little disposed to attack
others whose desire is to live as they themselves do, in freedom; while
the Princes of the Empire either are so poor that they cannot, or from
jealousy of the power of the Emperor will not, take part with him
against them.

These communities, therefore, abide contented within their narrow
confines, because, having regard to the Imperial authority, they have
no occasion to desire greater; and are at the same time obliged to live
in unity within their walls, because an enemy is always at hand, and
ready to take advantage of their divisions to effect an entrance. But
were the circumstances of the country other than they are these
communities would be forced to make attempts to extend their dominions,
and be constrained to relinquish their present peaceful mode of life.
And since the same conditions are not found elsewhere, other nations
cannot adopt this way of living, but are compelled to extend their
power either by means of leagues, or else by the methods used by the
Romans; and any one who should act otherwise would find not safety but
rather death and destruction. For since in a thousand ways, and from
causes innumerable, conquests are surrounded with dangers, it may well
happen that in adding to our dominions, we add nothing to our strength;
but whosoever increases not his strength while he adds to his
dominions, must needs be ruined. He who is impoverished by his wars,
even should he come off victorious, can add nothing to his strength,
since he spends more than he gains, as the Venetians and Florentines
have done. For Venice has been far feebler since she acquired Lombardy,
and Florence since she acquired Tuscany, than when the one was content
to be mistress of the seas, and the other of the lands lying within six
miles from her walls. And this from their eagerness to acquire without
knowing what way to take. For which ignorance these States are the more
to be blamed in proportion as there is less to excuse them; since they
had seen what methods were used by the Romans, and could have followed
in their footsteps; whereas the Romans, without any example set them,
were able by their own prudence to shape a course for themselves.

But even to well-governed States, their conquests may chance to
occasion much harm; as when some city or province is acquired abounding
in luxury and delights, by whose manners the conqueror becomes
infected; as happened first to the Romans, and afterwards to Hannibal
on taking possession of Capua. And had Capua been at such a distance
from Rome that a ready remedy could not have been applied to the
disorders of the soldiery, or had Rome herself been in any degree
tainted with corruption, this acquisition had certainly proved her
ruin. To which Titus Livius bears witness when he says, “_Most
mischievous at this time to our military discipline was Capua; for
ministering to all delights, she turned away the corrupted minds of our
soldiers from the remembrance of their country_.” And, truly, cities
and provinces like this, avenge themselves on their conquerors without
blood or blow; since by infecting them with their own evil customs they
prepare them for defeat at the hands of any assailant. Nor could the
subject have been better handled than by Juvenal, where he says in his
Satires, that into the hearts of the Romans, through their conquests in
foreign lands, foreign manners found their way; and in place of
frugality and other admirable virtues—

“Came luxury more mortal than the sword,
And settling down, avenged a vanquished world.”[8]


 [8] Sævior armis
Luxuria occubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem.
          _Juv. Sat_. vi. 292.


And if their conquests were like to be fatal to the Romans at a time
when they were still animated by great virtue and prudence, how must it
fare with those who follow methods altogether different from theirs,
and who, to crown their other errors of which we have already said
enough, resort to auxiliary and mercenary arms, bringing upon
themselves those dangers whereof mention shall be made in the Chapter
following.




CHAPTER XX.—_Of the Dangers incurred by Princes or Republics who resort
to Auxiliary or Mercenary Arms_.


Had I not already, in another treatise, enlarged on the inutility of
mercenary and auxiliary, and on the usefulness of national arms, I
should dwell on these matters in the present Discourse more at length
than it is my design to do. For having given the subject very full
consideration elsewhere, here I would be brief. Still when I find Titus
Livius supplying a complete example of what we have to look for from
auxiliaries, by whom I mean troops sent to our assistance by some other
prince or ruler, paid by him and under officers by him appointed, it is
not fit that I should pass it by in silence.

It is related, then, by our historian, that the Romans, after defeating
on two different occasions armies of the Samnites with forces sent by
them to succour the Capuans, whom they thus relieved from the war which
the Samnites Were waging against them, being desirious to return to
Rome, left behind two legions to defend the Capuans, that the latter
might not, from being altogether deprived of their protection, once
more become a prey to the Samnites. But these two legions, rotting in
idleness began to take such delight therein, that forgetful of their
country and the reverence due to the senate, they resolved to seize by
violence the city they had been left to guard by their valour. For to
them it seemed that the citizens of Capua were unworthy to enjoy
advantages which they knew not how to defend. The Romans, however,
getting timely notice of this design, at once met and defeated it, in
the manner to be more fully noticed when I come to treat of
conspiracies.

Once more then, I repeat, that of all the various kinds of troops,
auxiliaries are the most pernicious, because the prince or republic
resorting to them for aid has no authority over them, the only person
who possesses such authority being he who sends them. For, as I have
said, auxiliary troops are those sent to your assistance by some other
potentate, under his own flag, under his own officers, and in his own
pay, as were the legions sent by the Romans to Capua. Such troops, if
victorious, will for the most part plunder him by whom, as well as him
against whom, they are hired to fight; and this they do, sometimes at
the instigation of the potentate who sends them, sometimes for
ambitious ends of their own. It was not the purpose of the Romans to
violate the league and treaty which they had made with Capua; but to
their soldiers it seemed so easy a matter to master the Capuans, that
they were readily led into this plot for depriving them of their town
and territories. Many other examples might be given to the same effect,
but it is enough to mention besides this instance, that of the people
of Regium, who were deprived of their city and of their lives by
another Roman legion sent for their protection.

Princes and republics, therefore, should resort to any other expedient
for the defence of their States sooner than call in hired auxiliaries,
when they have to rest their entire hopes of safety on them; since any
accord or terms, however hard, which you may make with your enemy, will
be carefully studied and current events well considered, it will be
seen that for one who has succeeded with such assistance, hundreds have
been betrayed. Nor, in truth, can any better opportunity for usurping a
city or province present itself to an ambitious prince or commonwealth,
than to be asked to send an army for its defence. On the other hand, he
who is so greedy of conquest as to summon such help, not for purposes
of defence but in order to attack others, seeks to have what he can
never hold and is most likely to be taken from him by the very person
who helps him to gain it. Yet such is the perversity of men that, to
gratify the desire of the moment, they shut their eyes to those ills
which must speedily ensue and are no more moved by example in this
matter than in all those others of which I have spoken; for were they
moved by these examples they would see that the more disposed they are
to deal generously with their neighbours, and the more averse they are
to usurp authority over them, the readier will these be to throw
themselves into their arms; as will at once appear from the case of the
Capuans.




CHAPTER XXI.—_That Capua was the first City to which the Romans sent a
Prætor; nor there, until four hundred years after they began to make
War._


The great difference between the methods followed by the ancient Romans
in adding to their dominions, and those used for that purpose by the
States of the present time, has now been sufficiently discussed. It has
been seen, too how in dealing with the cities which they did not think
fit to destroy, and even with those which had made their submission not
as companions but as subjects, it was customary with the Romans to
permit them to live on under their own laws, without imposing any
outward sign of dependence, merely binding them to certain conditions,
or complying with which they were maintained in their former dignity
and importance. We know, further, that the same methods continued to be
followed by the Romans until they passed beyond the confines of Italy,
and began to reduce foreign kingdoms and States to provinces: as
plainly appears in the fact that Capua was the first city to which they
sent a prætor, and him from no motive of ambition, but at the request
of the Capuans themselves who, living at variance with one another,
thought it necessary to have a Roman citizen in their town who might
restore unity and good order among them. Influenced by this example,
and urged by the same need, the people of Antium were the next to ask
that they too might have a prætor given them; touching which request
and in connection with which new method of governing, Titus Livius
observes, “_that not the arms only but also the laws of Rome now began
to exert an influence;_” showing how much the course thus followed by
the Romans promoted the growth of their authority.

For those cities, more especially, which have been used to freedom or
to be governed by their own citizens, rest far better satisfied with a
government which they do not see, even though it involve something of
oppression, than with one which standing constantly before their eyes,
seems every day to reproach them with the disgrace of servitude. And to
the prince there is another advantage in this method of government,
namely, that as the judges and magistrates who administer the laws
civil and criminal within these cities, are not under his control, no
decision of theirs can throw responsibility or discredit upon him; so
that he thus escapes many occasions of calumny and hatred. Of the truth
whereof, besides the ancient instances which might be noted, we have a
recent example here in Italy. For Genoa, as every one knows, has many
times been occupied by the French king, who always, until lately, sent
thither a French governor to rule in his name. Recently, however, not
from choice but of necessity, he has permitted the town to be
self-governed under a Genoese ruler; and any one who had to decide
which of these two methods of governing gives the greater security to
the king’s authority and the greater content to the people themselves,
would assuredly have to pronounce in favour of the latter.

Men, moreover, in proportion as they see you averse to usurp authority
over them, grow the readier to surrender themselves into your hands;
and fear you less on the score of their freedom, when they find you
acting towards them with consideration and kindness. It was the display
of these qualities that moved the Capuans to ask the Romans for a
prætor; for had the Romans betrayed the least eagerness to send them
one, they would at once have conceived jealousy and grown estranged.

But why turn for examples to Capua and Rome, when we have them close at
hand in Tuscany and Florence? Who is there but knows what a time it is
since the city of Pistoja submitted of her own accord to the Florentine
supremacy? Who, again, but knows the animosity which down to the
present day exists between Florence and the cities of Pisa, Lucca, and
Siena? This difference of feeling does not arise from the citizens of
Pistoja valuing their freedom less than the citizens of these other
towns or thinking themselves inferior to them, but from the Florentines
having always acted towards the former as brothers, towards the latter
as foes. This it was that led the Pistojans to come voluntarily under
our authority while the others have done and do all in their power to
escape it. For there seems no reason to doubt, that if Florence,
instead of exasperating these neighbours of hers, had sought to win
them over, either by entering into league with them or by lending them
assistance, she would at this hour have been mistress of Tuscany. Not
that I would be understood to maintain that recourse is never to be had
to force and to arms, but that these are only to be used in the last
resort, and when all other remedies are unavailing.




CHAPTER XXII.—_That in matters of moment Men often judge amiss._


How falsely men often judge of things, they who are present at their
deliberations have constant occasion to know. For in many matters,
unless these deliberations be guided by men of great parts, the
conclusions come to are certain to be wrong. And because in corrupt
republics, and especially in quiet times, either through jealousy or
from other like causes, men of great ability are often obliged to stand
aloof, it follows that measures not good in themselves are by a common
error judged to be good, or are promoted by those who seek public
favour rather than the public advantage. Mistakes of this sort are
found out afterwards in seasons of adversity, when recourse must be had
to those persons who in peaceful times had been, as it were, forgotten,
as shall hereafter in its proper place be more fully explained. Cases,
moreover, arise in which those who have little experience of affairs
are sure to be misled, from the matters with which they have to deal
being attended by many deceptive appearances such as lead men to
believe whatsoever they are minded to believe.

These remarks I make with reference to the false hopes which the
Latins, after being defeated by the Romans, were led to form on the
persuasion of their prætor Numitius, and also with reference to what
was believed by many a few years ago, when Francis, king of France,
came to recover Milan from the Swiss. For Francis of Angoulême,
succeeding on the death of Louis XII. to the throne of France, and
desiring to recover for that realm the Duchy of Milan, on which, some
years before, the Swiss had seized at the instance of Pope Julius,
sought for allies in Italy to second him in his attempt; and besides
the Venetians, who had already been gained over by King Louis,
endeavoured to secure the aid of the Florentines and Pope Leo X.;
thinking that were he to succeed in getting these others to take part
with him, his enterprise would be easier. For the forces of the Spanish
king were then in Lombardy, and the army of the Emperor at Verona.

Pope Leo, however, did not fall in with the wishes of Francis, being,
it is said, persuaded by his advisers that his best course was to stand
neutral. For they urged that it was not for the advantage of the Church
to have powerful strangers, whether French or Swiss, in Italy; but that
to restore the country to its ancient freedom, it must be delivered
from the yoke of both. And since to conquer both, whether singly or
together, was impossible, it was to be desired that the one should
overthrow the other, after which the Church with her friends might fall
upon the victor. And it was averred that no better opportunity for
carrying out this design could ever be found than then presented
itself; for both the French and the Swiss were in the field; while the
Pope had his troops in readiness to appear on the Lombard frontier and
in the vicinity of the two armies, where, under colour of watching his
own interests, he could easily keep them until the opposed hosts came
to an engagement; when, as both armies were full of courage, their
encounter might be expected to be a bloody one, and likely to leave the
victor so weakened that it would be easy for the Pope to attack and
defeat him; and so, to his own great glory, remain master of Lombardy
and supreme throughout Italy.

How baseless this expectation was, was seen from the event. For the
Swiss being routed after a protracted combat, the troops of the Pope
and Spain, so far from venturing to attack the conqueror, prepared for
flight; nor would flight have saved them, had not the humanity or
indifference of the king withheld him from pursuing his victory, and
disposed him to make terms with the Church.

The arguments put forward by the Pope’s advisers had a certain show of
reason in their favour, which looked at from a distance seemed
plausible enough; but were in reality wholly contrary to truth; since
it rarely happens that the captain who wins a victory loses any great
number of his men, his loss being in battle only, and not in flight.
For in the heat of battle, while men stand face to face, but few fall,
chiefly because such combats do not last long; and even when they do
last, and many of the victorious army are slain, so splendid is the
reputation which attends a victory, and so great the terror it
inspires, as far to outweigh any loss the victor suffers by the
slaughter of his soldiers; so that an enemy who, trusting to find him
weakened, should then venture to attack him, would soon be taught his
mistake, unless strong enough to give him battle at any time, before
his victory as well as after. For in that case he might, as fortune and
valour should determine, either win or lose; though, even then, the
army which had first fought and won would have an advantage. And this
we know for a truth from what befell the Latins in consequence of the
mistake made by Numitius their prætor, and their blindness in believing
him. For when they had already suffered defeat at the hands of the
Romans, Numitius caused it to be proclaimed throughout the whole
country of Latium, that now was the time to fall upon the enemy,
exhausted by a struggle in which they were victorious only in name,
while in reality suffering all those ills which attend defeat, and who
might easily be crushed by any fresh force brought against them.
Whereupon the Latins believed him, and getting together a new army,
were forthwith routed with such loss as always awaits those who listen
to like counsels.




CHAPTER XXIII.—_That in chastising their Subjects when circumstances
required it the Romans always avoided half-measures._


“Such _was now the state of affairs in Latium, that peace and war
seemed alike intolerable_.” No worse calamity can befall a prince or
commonwealth than to be reduced to such straits that they can neither
accept peace nor support war; as is the case with those whom it would
ruin to conclude peace on the terms offered, while war obliges them
either to yield themselves a spoil to their allies, or remain a prey to
their foes. To this grievous alternative are men led by evil counsels
and unwise courses, and, as already said, from not rightly measuring
their strength. For the commonwealth or prince who has rightly measured
his strength, can hardly be brought so low as were the Latins, who made
war with the Romans when they should have made terms, and made terms
when they should have made war, and so mismanaged everything that the
friendship and the enmity of Rome were alike fatal. Whence it came
that, in the first place, they were defeated and broken by Manlius
Torquatus, and afterwards utterly subdued by Camillus; who, when he had
forced them to surrender at discretion to the Roman arms, and had
placed garrisons in all their towns, and taken hostages from all,
returned to Rome and reported to the senate that the whole of Latium
now lay at their mercy.

And because the sentence then passed by the senate is memorable, and
worthy to be studied by princes that it may be imitated by them on like
occasion, I shall cite the exact words which Livius puts into the mouth
of Camillus, as confirming what I have already said touching the
methods used by the Romans to extend their power, and as showing how in
chastising their subjects they always avoided half-measures and took a
decided course. For government consists in nothing else than in so
controlling your subjects that it shall neither be in their power nor
for their interest to harm you. And this is effected either by making
such sure work with them as puts it out of their power to do you
injury, or else by so loading them with benefits that it would be folly
in them to seek to alter their condition. All which is implied first in
the measures proposed by Camillus, and next in the resolutions passed
on these proposals by the senate. The words of Camillus were as
follows: “_The immortal gods have made you so entirely masters in the
matter you are now considering, that_ _it lies with you to pronounce
whether Latium shall or shall not longer exist. So far as the Latins
are concerned, you can secure a lasting peace either by clemency or by
severity. Would you deal harshly with those whom you have conquered and
who have given themselves into your hands, you can blot out the whole
Latin nation. Would you, after the fashion of our ancestors, increase
the strength of Rome by admitting the vanquished to the rights of
citizenship, here you have opportunity to do so, and with the greatest
glory to yourselves. That, assuredly, is the strongest government which
they rejoice in who obey it. Now, then, is your time, while the minds
of all are bent on what is about to happen, to obtain an ascendency
over them, either by punishment or by benefits._”

Upon this motion the senate resolved, in accordance with the advice
given by the consul, to take the case of each city separately, and
either destroy utterly or else treat with tenderness all the more
important of the Latin towns. To those cities they dealt with
leniently, they granted exemptions and privileges, conferring upon them
the rights of citizenship, and securing their welfare in every
particular. The others they razed to the ground, and planting colonies
in their room, either removed the inhabitants to Rome, or so scattered
and dispersed them that neither by arms nor by counsels was it ever
again in their power to inflict hurt. For, as I have said already, the
Romans never, in matters of moment, resorted to half-measures. And the
sentence which they then pronounced should be a pattern for all rulers,
and ought to have been followed by the Florentines when, in the year
1502, Arezzo and all the Val di Chiana rose in revolt. For had they
followed it, they would have established their authority on a surer
footing, and added much to the greatness of their city by securing for
it those lands which are needed to supply it with the necessaries of
life. But pursuing that half-hearted policy which is most mischievous
in executing justice, some of the Aretines they outlawed, some they
condemned to death, and all they deprived of their dignities and
ancient importance in their town, while leaving the town itself
untouched. And if in the councils then held any Florentine recommended
that Arezzo should be dismantled, they who thought themselves wiser
than their fellows objected, that to do so would be little to the
honour of our republic, since it would look as though she lacked
strength to hold it. Reasons like this are of a sort which seem sound,
but are not really so; for, by the same rule, no parricide should be
put to death, nor any other malefactor, however atrocious his crimes;
because, forsooth, it would be discreditable to the ruler to appear
unequal to the control of a single criminal. They who hold such
opinions fail to see that when men individually, or entire cities
collectively, offend against the State, the prince for his own safety,
and as a warning to others, has no alternative but to make an end of
them; and that true honour lies in being able and in knowing how to
chastise such offenders, and not in incurring endless dangers in the
effort to retain them. For the prince who does not chastise offenders
in a way that puts it out of their power to offend again, is accounted
unwise or worthless.

How necessary it was for the Romans to execute Justice against the
Latins, is further seen from the course took with the men of Privernum.
And here the text of Livius suggests two points for our attention:
first, as already noted, that a subjugated people is either to be
caressed or crushed; and second, how much it is for our advantage to
maintain a manly bearing, and to speak the truth fearlessly in the
presence of the wise. For the senate being met to determine the fate of
the citizens of Privernum, who after rebelling had been reduced to
submission by the Roman arms, certain of these citizens were sent by
their countrymen to plead for pardon. When these had come into the
presence of the senate, one of them was asked by a senator, “_What
punishment he thought his fellow citizens deserved?_” To which he of
Privernum answered, “_Such punishment as they deserve who deem
themselves worthy of freedom._” “_But,_” said the consul, “_should we
remit your punishment, what sort of peace can we hope to have with
you?_” To which the other replied, “_If granted on fair terms, a firm
and lasting peace; if on unfair, a peace of brief duration._” Upon
this, though many of the senators were displeased, the wiser among them
declared “_that they had heard the voice of freedom and manhood, and
would never believe that the man or people who so spoke ought to remain
longer than was needful in a position which gave them cause for shame;
since that was a safe peace which was accepted willingly; whereas good
faith could not be looked for where it was sought to impose
servitude._” So saying, they decided that the people of Privernum
should be admitted to Roman citizenship, with all the rights and
privileges thereto appertaining; declaring that “_men whose only
thought was for freedom, were indeed worthy to be Romans._” So pleasing
was this true and high answer to generous minds, while any other must
have seemed at once false and shameful. And they who judge otherwise of
men, and of those men, especially, who have been used to be free, or so
to think themselves, are mistaken; and are led through their mistake to
adopt courses unprofitable for themselves and affording no content to
others. Whence, the frequent rebellions and the downfall of States.

But, returning to our subject, I conclude, as well from this instance
of Privernum, as from the measures followed with the Latins, that when
we have to pass sentence upon powerful States accustomed to live in
freedom, we must either destroy them utterly, or else treat them with
much indulgence; and that any other course we may take with them will
be unprofitable. But most carefully should we avoid, as of all courses
the most pernicious, such half-measures as were followed by the
Samnites when they had the Romans shut up in the Caudine Forks, and
would not listen to the counsels of the old man who urged them either
to send their captives away with every honourable attention, or else
put them all to death; but adopted a middle course, and after disarming
them and making them pass under the yoke, suffered them to depart at
once disgraced and angered. And no long time after, they found to their
sorrow that the old man’s warning was true, and that the course they
had themselves chosen was calamitous; as shall, hereafter, in its place
be shown.




CHAPTER XXIV.—_That, commonly, Fortresses do much more Harm than Good_


To the wise men of our day it may seem an oversight on the part of the
Romans, that, when they sought to protect themselves against the men of
Latium and Privernum, it never occurred to them to build strongholds in
their cities to be a curb upon them, and insure their fidelity,
especially when we remember the Florentine saying which these same wise
men often quote, to the effect that Pisa and other like cities must be
held by fortresses Doubtless, had those old Romans been like-minded
with our modern sages, they would not have neglected to build
themselves fortresses, but because they far surpassed them in courage,
sense, and vigour, they refrained. And while Rome retained her freedom,
and adhered to her own wise ordinances and wholesome usages, she never
built a single fortress with the view to hold any city or province,
though, sometimes, she may have suffered those to stand which she found
already built.

Looking, therefore, to the course followed by the Romans in this
particular, and to that adopted by our modern rulers, it seems proper
to consider whether or not it is advisable to build fortresses, and
whether they are more likely to help or to hurt him who builds them In
the first place, then, we are to remember that fortresses are built
either as a defence against foreign foes or against subjects In the
former case, I pronounce them unnecessary, in the latter mischievous.
And to state the reasons why in the latter case they are mischievous, I
say that when princes or republics are afraid of their subjects and in
fear lest they rebel, this must proceed from knowing that their
subjects hate them, which hatred in its turn results from their own ill
conduct, and that again from their thinking themselves able to rule
their subjects by mere force, or from their governing with little
prudence. Now one of the causes which lead them to suppose that they
can rule by mere force, is this very circumstance of their people
having these fortresses on their backs So that the conduct which breeds
hatred is itself mainly occasioned by these princes or republics being
possessed of fortresses, which, if this be true, are really far more
hurtful than useful First, because, as has been said already, they
render a ruler bolder and more violent in his bearing towards his
subjects, and, next, because they do not in reality afford him that
security which he believes them to give For all those methods of
violence and coercion which may be used to keep a people under, resolve
themselves into two; since either like the Romans you must always have
it in your power to bring a strong army into the field, or else you
must dissipate, destroy, and disunite the subject people, and so divide
and scatter them that they can never again combine to injure you For
should you merely strip them of their wealth, _spoliatis arma
supersunt_, arms still remain to them, or if you deprive them of their
weapons, _furor arma ministrat_, rage will supply them, if you put
their chiefs to death and continue to maltreat the rest, heads will
renew themselves like those Hydra; while, if you build fortresses,
these may serve in time of peace to make you bolder in outraging your
subjects, but in time of war they will prove wholly useless, since they
will be attacked at once by foes both foreign and domestic, whom
together it will be impossible for you to resist. And if ever
fortresses were useless they are so at the present day, by reason of
the invention of artillery, against the fury of which, as I have shown
already, a petty fortress which affords no room for retreat behind
fresh works, cannot be defended.

But to go deeper into the matter, I say, either you are a prince
seeking by means of these fortresses to hold the people of your city in
check; or you are a prince, or it may be a republic, desirous to
control some city which you have gained in war. To the prince I would
say, that, for the reasons already given, nothing can be more
unserviceable than a fortress as a restraint upon your subjects, since
it only makes you the readier to oppress them, and less scrupulous how
you do so; while it is this very oppression which moves them to destroy
you, and so kindles their hatred, that the fortress, which is the cause
of all the mischief, is powerless to protect you. A wise and good
prince, therefore, that he may continue good, and give no occasion or
encouragement to his descendants to become evil, will never build a
fortress, to the end that neither he nor they may ever be led to trust
to it rather than to the good-will of their subjects. And if Francesco
Sforza, who was accounted a wise ruler, on becoming Duke of Milan
erected a fortress in that city, I say that herein he was unwise, and
that the event has shown the building of this fortress to have been
hurtful and not helpful to his heirs. For thinking that by its aid they
could behave as badly as they liked to their citizens and subjects, and
yet be secure, they refrained from no sort of violence or oppression,
until, becoming beyond measure odious, they lost their State as soon as
an enemy attacked it. Nor was this fortress, which in peace had
occasioned them much hurt, any defence or of any service them in war.
For had they being without it, through thoughtlessness, treated their
subjects inhumanely, they must soon have discovered and withdrawn from
their danger; and might, thereafter, with no other help than that of
attached subjects, have withstood the attacks of the French far more
successfully than they could with their fortress, but with subjects
whom they had estranged.

And, in truth, fortresses are unserviceable in every way, since they
may be lost either by the treachery of those to whom you commit their
defence, or by the overwhelming strength of an assailant, or else by
famine. And where you seek to recover a State which you have lost, and
in which only the fortress remains to you, if that fortress is to be of
any service or assistance to you, you must have an army wherewith to
attack the enemy who has driven you out. But with such an army you
might succeed in recovering your State as readily without a fortress as
with one; nay, perhaps, even more readily, since your subjects, had you
not used them ill, from the overweening confidence your fortress gave
you, might then have felt better disposed towards you. And the event
shows that in times of adversity this very fortress of Milan has been
of no advantage whatever, either to the Sforzas or to the French; but,
on the contrary, has brought ruin on both, because, trusting to it,
they did not turn their thoughts to nobler methods for preserving that
State. Guido Ubaldo, duke of Urbino and son to Duke Federigo, who in
his day was a warrior of much renown, but who was driven from his
dominions by Cesare Borgia, son to Pope Alexander VI., when afterwards,
by a sudden stroke of good fortune, he was restored to the dukedom
caused all the fortresses of the country to be dismantled, judging them
to be hurtful. For as he was beloved by his subjects, so far as they
were concerned he had no need for fortresses; while, as against foreign
enemies, he saw he could not defend them, since this would have
required an army kept constantly in the field. For which reasons he
made them be razed to the ground.

When Pope Julius II. had driven the Bentivogli from Bologna, after
erecting a citadel in that town, he caused the people to be cruelly
oppressed by his governor; whereupon, the people rebelled, and he
forthwith lost the citadel; so that his citadel, and the oppressions to
which it led, were of less service to him than different behaviour on
his part had been. When Niccolo da Castello, the ancestor of the
Vitelli, returned to his country out of exile, he straightway pulled
down the two fortresses built there by Pope Sixtus IV., perceiving that
it was not by fortresses, but by the good-will of the people, that he
could be maintained in his government.

But the most recent, and in all respects most noteworthy instance, and
that which best demonstrates the futility of building, and the
advantage of destroying fortresses, is what happened only the other day
in Genoa. Every one knows how, in 1507, Genoa rose in rebellion against
Louis XII. of France, who came in person and with all his forces to
recover it; and after recovering it built there a citadel stronger than
any before known, being, both from its position and from every other
circumstance, most inaccessible to attack. For standing on the
extremity of a hill, named by the Genoese Codefa, which juts out into
the sea, it commanded the whole harbour and the greater part of the
town. But, afterwards, in the year 1512, when the French were driven
out of Italy, the Genoese, in spite of this citadel, again rebelled,
and Ottaviano Fregoso assuming the government, after the greatest
efforts, continued over a period of sixteen months, at last succeeded
in reducing the citadel by famine. By all it was believed that he would
retain it as a rock of refuge in case of any reverse of fortune, and by
some he was advised to do so; but he, being a truly wise ruler, and
knowing well that it is by the attachment of their subjects and not by
the strength of their fortifications that princes are maintained in
their governments, dismantled this citadel; and founding his authority,
not upon material defences, but on his own valour and prudence, kept
and still keeps it. And whereas, formerly, a force of a thousand
foot-soldiers could effect a change in the government of Genoa, the
enemies of Ottaviano have assailed him with ten thousand, without being
able to harm him.

Here, then, we see that, while to dismantle this fortress occasioned
Ottaviano no loss, its construction gave the French king no sort of
advantage. For when he could come into Italy with an army, he could
recover Genoa, though he had no citadel there; but when he could not
come with an army, it was not in his power to hold the city by means of
the citadel. Moreover it was costly for the king to build, and shameful
for him to lose this fortress; while for Ottaviano it was glorious to
take, and advantageous to destroy it.

Let us turn now to those republics which build fortresses not within
their own territories, but in towns whereof they have taken possession.
And if the above example of France and Genoa suffice not to show the
futility of this course, that of Florence and Pisa ought, I think, to
be conclusive. For in erecting fortresses to hold Pisa, the Florentines
failed to perceive that a city which had always been openly hostile to
them, which had lived in freedom, and which could cloak rebellion under
the name of liberty, must, if it were to be retained at all, be
retained by those methods which were used by the Romans, and either be
made a companion or be destroyed. Of how little service these Pisan
fortresses were, was seen on the coming of Charles VIII. of France into
Italy, to whom, whether through the treachery of their defenders or
from fear of worse evils, they were at once delivered up; whereas, had
there been no fortresses in Pisa, the Florentines would not have looked
to them as the means whereby the town was to be held; the king could
not by their assistance have taken the town from the Florentines; and
the methods whereby it had previously been preserved might, in all
likelihood, have continued sufficient to preserve it; and, at any rate,
had served that end no worse than the fortresses.

These, then, are the conclusions to which I come, namely, that
fortresses built to hold your own country under are hurtful, and that
those built to retain acquired territories are useless; and I am
content to rely on the example of the Romans, who in the towns they
sought to hold by the strong hand, rather pulled down fortresses than
built them. And if any, to controvert these views of mine, were to cite
the case of Tarentum in ancient times, or of Brescia in recent, as
towns which when they rebelled were recovered by means of their
citadels; I answer, that for the recovery of Tarentum, Fabius Maximus
was sent at the end of a year with an army strong enough to retake it
even had there been no fortress there; and that although he availed
himself of the fortress for the recovery of the town, he might, without
it, have resorted to other means which would have brought about the
same result. Nor do I see of what service a citadel can be said to be,
when to recover the city you must employ a consular army under a Fabius
Maximus. But that the Romans would, in any case, have recovered
Tarentum, is plain from what happened at Capua, where there was no
citadel, and which they retook, simply by the valour of their soldiers.

Again, as regards Brescia, I say that the circumstances attending the
revolt of that town were such as occur but seldom, namely, that the
citadel remaining in your hands after the defection of the city, you
should happen to have a great army nigh at hand, as the French had
theirs on this occasion. For M. de Foix being in command of the king’s
forces at Bologna, on hearing of the loss of Brescia, marched thither
without an hour’s delay, and reaching Brescia in three days, retook the
town with the help of the citadel. But here, again, we see that, to be
of any service, the citadel of Brescia had to be succoured by a de
Foix, and by that French army which in three days’ time marched to its
relief. So that this instance cannot be considered conclusive as
against others of a contrary tendency. For, in the course of recent
wars, many fortresses have been taken and retaken, with the same
variety of fortune with which open country has been acquired or lost;
and this not only in Lombardy, but also in Romagna, in the kingdom of
Naples, and in all parts of Italy.

And, further, touching the erection of fortresses as a defence against
foreign enemies, I say that such defences are not needed by the prince
or people who possess a good army; while for those who do not possess a
good army, they are useless. For good armies without fortresses are in
themselves a sufficient defence: whereas, fortresses without good
armies avail nothing. And this we see in the case of those nations
which have been thought to excel both in their government and
otherwise, as, for instance, the Romans and the Spartans. For while the
Romans would build no fortresses, the Spartans not merely abstained
from building them, but would not even suffer their cities to be
enclosed with walls; desiring to be protected by their own valour only,
and by no other defence. So that when a Spartan was asked by an
Athenian what he thought of the walls of Athens, he answered “that they
were fine walls if meant to hold women only.”

If a prince who has a good army has likewise, on the sea-front of his
dominions, some fortress strong enough to keep an enemy in check for a
few days, until he gets his forces together, this, though not
necessary, may sometimes be for his advantage. But for a prince who is
without a strong army to have fortresses erected throughout his
territories, or upon his frontier, is either useless or hurtful, since
they may readily be lost and then turned against him; or, supposing
them so strong that the enemy is unable to take them by assault, he may
leave them behind, and so render them wholly unprofitable. For a brave
army, unless stoutly met, enters an enemy’s country without regard to
the towns or fortified places it leaves in its rear, as we read of
happening in ancient times, and have seen done by Francesco Maria della
Rovere, who no long while ago, when he marched against Urbino, made
little of leaving ten hostile cities behind him.

The prince, therefore, who can bring together a strong army can do
without building fortresses, while he who has not a strong army ought
not to build them, but should carefully strengthen the city wherein he
dwells, and keep it well stored with supplies, and its inhabitants well
affected, so that he may resist attack till an accord be agreed on, or
he be relieved by foreign aid. All other expedients are costly in time
of peace, and in war useless.

Whoever carefully weighs all that has now been said will perceive, that
the Romans, as they were most prudent in all their other methods, so
also showed their wisdom in the measures they took with the men of
Latium and Privernum, when, without ever thinking of fortresses, they
sought security in bolder and more sagacious courses.




CHAPTER XXV.—_That he who attacks a City divided against itself, must
not think to get possession of it through its Divisions._


Violent dissensions breaking out in Rome between the commons and the
nobles, it appeared to the Veientines and Etruscans that now was their
time to deal a fatal blow to the Roman supremacy. Accordingly, they
assembled an army and invaded the territories of Rome. The senate sent
Caius Manlius and Marcus Fabius to meet them, whose forces encamping
close by the Veientines, the latter ceased not to reproach and vilify
the Roman name with every sort of taunt and abuse, and so incensed the
Romans by their unmeasured insolence that, from being divided they
became reconciled, and giving the enemy battle, broke and defeated
them. Here, again, we see, what has already been noted, how prone men
are to adopt wrong courses, and how often they miss their object when
they think to secure it. The Veientines imagined that they could
conquer the Romans by attacking them while they were at feud among
themselves; but this very attack reunited the Romans and brought ruin
on their assailants. For the causes of division in a commonwealth are,
for the most part, ease and tranquillity, while the causes of union are
fear and war. Wherefore, had the Veientines been wise, the more divided
they saw Rome to be, the more should they have sought to avoid war with
her, and endeavoured to gain an advantage over her by peaceful arts.
And the best way to effect this in a divided city lies in gaining the
confidence of both factions, and in mediating between them as arbiter
so long as they do not come to blows; but when they resort to open
violence, then to render some tardy aid to the weaker side, so as to
plunge them deeper in hostilities, wherein both may exhaust their
forces without being led by your putting forth an excess of strength to
suspect you of a desire to ruin them and remain their master. Where
this is well managed, it will almost always happen that you succeed in
effecting the object you propose to yourself.

The city of Pistoja, as I have said already in connection with another
matter, was won over to the Florentine republic by no other artifice
than this. For the town being split by factions, the Florentines, by
now favouring one side and now the other, without incurring the
suspicions of either, brought both to such extremities that, wearied
out with their harassed life, they threw themselves at last of their
own accord into the arms of Florence. The city of Siena, again, has
never made any change in her government which has had the support of
the Florentines, save when that support has been slight and
insignificant; for whenever the interference of Florence has been
marked and decided, it has had the effect of uniting all parties in
support of things as they stood.

One other instance I shall add to those already given. Oftener than
once Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, relying on their divisions, set
wars on foot against the Florentines, and always without success; so
that, in lamenting over these failures, he was wont to complain that
the mad humours of the Florentines had cost him two millions of gold,
without his having anything to show for it. The Veientines and
Etruscans, therefore, as I have said already, were misled by false
hopes, and in the end were routed by the Romans in a single pitched
battle; and any who should look hereafter to prevail on like grounds
and by similar means against a divided people, will always find
themselves deceived.




CHAPTER XXVI.—_That Taunts and Abuse breed Hatred against him who uses
them, without yielding him any Advantage._


To abstain from threats and injurious language, is, methinks, one of
the wisest precautions a man can use. For abuse and menace take nothing
from the strength of an adversary; the latter only making him more
cautious, while the former inflames his hatred against you, and leads
him to consider more diligently how he may cause you hurt.

This is seen from the example of the Veientines, of whom I spoke in the
last Chapter, who, to the injury of war against the Romans, added those
verbal injuries from which all prudent commanders should compel their
soldiers to refrain. For these are injuries which stir and kindle your
enemy to vengeance, and yet, as has been said, in no way disable him
from doing you hurt; so that, in truth, they are weapons which wound
those who use them. Of this we find a notable instance in Asia, in
connection with the siege of Amida. For Gabade, the Persian general,
after besieging this town for a great while, wearied out at last by its
protracted defence, determined on withdrawing his army; and had
actually begun to strike his camp, when the whole inhabitants of the
place, elated by their success, came out upon the walls to taunt and
upbraid their enemies with their cowardice and meanness of spirit, and
to load them with every kind of abuse. Stung by these insults, Gabade,
changing his resolution, renewed the siege with such fury that in a few
days he stormed and sacked the town. And the very same thing befell the
Veientines, who, not content, as we have seen, to make war on the
Romans with arms, must needs assail them with foul reproaches,
advancing to the palisade of their camp to revile them, and molesting
them more with their tongues than with their swords, until the Roman
soldiers, who at first were most unwilling to fight, forced the consuls
to lead them to the attack. Whereupon, the Veientines, like those
others of whom mention has just now been made, had to pay the penalty
of their insolence.

Wise captains of armies, therefore, and prudent governors of cities,
should take all fit precautions to prevent such insults and reproaches
from being used by their soldiers and subjects, either amongst
themselves or against an enemy. For when directed against an enemy they
lead to the mischiefs above noticed, while still worse consequences may
follow from our not preventing them among ourselves by such measures as
sensible rulers have always taken for that purpose.

The legions who were left behind for the protection of Capua having, as
shall in its place be told, conspired against the Capuans, their
conspiracy led to a mutiny, which was presently suppressed by Valerius
Corvinus; when, as one of the conditions on which the mutineers made
their submission, it was declared that whosoever should thereafter
upbraid any soldier of these legions with having taken part in this
mutiny, should be visited with the severest punishment. So likewise,
when Tiberius Gracchus was appointed, during the war with Hannibal, to
command a body of slaves, whom the Romans in their straits for soldiers
had furnished with arms, one of his first acts was to pass an order
making it death for any to reproach his men with their servile origin.
So mischievous a thing did the Romans esteem it to use insulting words
to others, or to taunt them with their shame. Whether this be done in
sport or earnest, nothing vexes men more, or rouses them to fiercer
indignation; “_for the biting jest which flavours too much of truth,
leaves always behind it a rankling memory._”[9]

 memoriam relinquunt. _Tacit. An._ xv. 68.




CHAPTER XXVII.—_That prudent Princes and Republics should be content to
have obtained a Victory; for, commonly, when they are not,
theft-Victory turns to Defeat._


The use of dishonouring language towards an enemy is mostly caused by
an insolent humour, bred by victory or the false hope of it, whereby
men are oftentimes led not only to speak, but also to act amiss. For
such false hopes, when they gain an entry into men’s minds, cause them
to overrun their goal, and to miss opportunities for securing a certain
good, on the chance of obtaining some thing better, but uncertain. And
this, being a matter that deserves attention, because in deceiving
themselves men often injure their country, I desire to illustrate it by
particular instances, ancient and recent, since mere argument might not
place it in so clear a light.

After routing the Romans at Cannæ, Hannibal sent messengers to Carthage
to announce his victory, and to ask support. A debate arising in the
Carthaginian senate as to what was to be done, Hanno, an aged and wise
citizen, advised that they should prudently take advantage of their
victory to make peace with the Romans, while as conquerors they might
have it on favourable terms, and not wait to make it after a defeat;
since it should be their object to show the Romans that they were
strong enough to fight them, but not to peril the victory they had won
in the hope of winning a greater. This advice was not followed by the
Carthaginian senate, but its wisdom was well seen later, when the
opportunity to act upon it was gone.

When the whole East had been overrun by Alexander of Macedon, the
citizens of Tyre (then at the height of its renown, and very strong
from being built, like Venice, in the sea), recognizing his greatness,
sent ambassadors to him to say that they desired to be his good
servants, and to yield him all obedience, yet could not consent to
receive either him or his soldiers within their walls. Whereupon,
Alexander, displeased that a single city should venture to close its
gates against him to whom all the rest of the world had thrown theirs
open, repulsed the Tyrians, and rejecting their overtures set to work
to besiege their town. But as it stood on the water, and was well
stored with victual and all other munitions needed for its defence,
after four months had gone, Alexander, perceiving that he was wasting
more time in an inglorious attempt to reduce this one city than had
sufficed for most of his other conquests, resolved to offer terms to
the Tyrians, and to make them those concessions which they themselves
had asked. But they, puffed up by their success, not merely refused the
terms offered, but put to death the envoy sent to propose them. Enraged
by this, Alexander renewed the siege, and with such vigour, that he
took and destroyed the city, and either slew or made slaves of its
inhabitants.

In the year 1512, a Spanish army entered the Florentine territory, with
the object of restoring the Medici to Florence, and of levying a
subsidy from the town; having been summoned thither by certain of the
citizens, who had promised them that so soon as they appeared within
the Florentine confines they would arm in their behalf. But when the
Spaniards had come into the plain of the Arno, and none declared in
their favour, being in sore need of supplies, they offered to make
terms. This offer the people of Florence in their pride rejected, and
so gave occasion for the sack of Prato and the overthrow of the
Florentine Republic.

A prince, therefore, who is attacked by an enemy much more powerful
than himself, can make no greater mistake than to refuse to treat,
especially when overtures are made to him; for however poor the terms
offered may be, they are sure to contain some conditions advantageous
for him who accepts them, and which he may construe as a partial
success. For which reason it ought to have been enough for the citizens
of Tyre that Alexander was brought to accept terms which he had at
first rejected; and they should have esteemed it a sufficient triumph
that, by their resistance in arms, they had forced so great a warrior
to bow to their will. And, in like manner, it should have been a
sufficient victory for the Florentines that the Spaniards had in part
yielded to their wishes, and abated something of their own demands, the
purport of which was to change the government of Florence, to sever her
from her allegiance to France, and, further, to obtain money from her.
For if of these three objects the Spaniards had succeeded in securing
the last two, while the Florentines maintained the integrity of their
government, a fair share of honour and contentment would have fallen to
each. And while preserving their political existence, the Florentines
should have made small account of the other two conditions; nor ought
they, even with the possibility and almost certainty of greater
advantages before them, to have left matters in any degree to the
arbitration of Fortune, by pushing things to extremes, and incurring
risks which no prudent man should incur, unless compelled by necessity.

Hannibal, when recalled by the Carthaginians from Italy, where for
sixteen years he had covered himself with glory, to the defence of his
native country, found on his arrival that Hasdrubal and Syphax had been
defeated, the kingdom of Numidia lost, and Carthage confined within the
limits of her walls, and left without other resource save in him and
his army. Perceiving, therefore, that this was the last stake his
country had to play, and not choosing to hazard it until he had tried
every other expedient, he felt no shame to sue for peace, judging that
in peace rather than in war lay the best hope of safety for his
country. But, when peace was refused him, no fear of defeat deterred
him from battle, being resolved either to conquer, if conquer he might,
or if he must fall, to fall gloriously. Now, if a commander so valiant
as Hannibal, at the head of an unconquered army, was willing to sue for
peace rather than appeal to battle when he saw that by defeat his
country must be enslaved, what course ought to be followed by another
commander, less valiant and with less experience than he? But men
labour under this infirmity, that they know not where to set bounds to
their hopes, and building on these without otherwise measuring their
strength, rush headlong on destruction.




CHAPTER XXVIII.—_That to neglect the redress of Grievances, whether
public or private, is dangerous for a Prince or Commonwealth_.


Certain Gauls coming to attack Etruria, and more particularly Clusium
its chief city, the citizens of Clusium sought aid from Rome; whereupon
the Romans sent the three Fabii, as envoys to these Gauls, to notify to
them, in the name of the Roman people, that they must refrain from
making war on the Etruscans. From what befell the Romans in connection
with this embassy, we see clearly how far men may be carried in
resenting an affront. For these envoys arriving at the very moment when
the Gauls and Etruscans were about to join battle, being readier at
deeds than words, took part with the Etruscans and fought in their
foremost ranks. Whence it came that the Gauls recognizing the Roman
envoys, turned against the Romans all the hatred which before they had
felt for the Etruscans; and grew still more incensed when on making
complaint to the Roman senate, through their ambassador, of the wrong
done them, and demanding that the Fabii should be given up to them in
atonement for their offence, not merely were the offenders not given up
or punished in any way, but, on the contrary, when the comitia met were
created tribunes with consular powers. But when the Gauls found these
men honoured who deserved to be chastised, they concluded that what had
happened had been done by way of slight and insult to them, and,
burning with fury and resentment, hastened forward to attack Rome,
which they took with the exception of the Capitol.

Now this disaster overtook the Romans entirely from their disregard of
justice. For their envoys, who had violated the law of nations, and had
therefore deserved punishment, they had on the contrary treated with
honour. And this should make us reflect, how carefully all princes and
commonwealths ought to refrain from committing like wrongs, not only
against communities, but also against particular men. For if a man be
deeply wronged, either by a private hand or by a public officer, and be
not avenged to his satisfaction, if he live in a republic, he will seek
to avenge himself, though in doing so he bring ruin on his country; or
if he live under a prince, and be of a resolute and haughty spirit, he
will never rest until he has wreaked his resentment against the prince,
though he knows it may cost him dear. Whereof we have no finer or truer
example than in the death of Philip of Macedon, the father of
Alexander. For Pausanias, a handsome and high-born youth belonging to
Philip’s court, having been most foully and cruelly dishonoured by
Attalus, one of the foremost men of the royal household, repeatedly
complained to Philip of the outrage; who for a while put him off with
promises of vengeance, but in the end, so far from avenging him,
promoted Attalus to be governor of the province of Greece. Whereupon,
Pausanias, seeing his enemy honoured and not punished, turned all his
resentment from him who had outraged, against him who had not avenged
him, and on the morning of the day fixed for the marriage of Philip’s
daughter to Alexander of Epirus, while Philip walked between the two
Alexanders, his son and his son-in-law, towards the temple to celebrate
the nuptials, he slew him.

This instance nearly resembles that of the Roman envoys; and offers a
warning to all rulers never to think so lightly of any man as to
suppose, that when wrong upon wrong has been done him, he will not
bethink himself of revenge, however great the danger he runs, or the
punishment he thereby brings upon himself.




CHAPTER XXIX.—_That Fortune obscures the minds of Men when she would
not have them hinder her Designs._


If we note well the course of human affairs, we shall often find things
come about and accidents befall, against which it seems to be the will
of Heaven that men should not provide. And if this were the case even
in Rome, so renowned for her valour, religion, and wise ordinances, we
need not wonder if it be far more common in other cities and provinces
wherein these safeguards are wanting.

Having here a notable opportunity to show how Heaven influences men’s
actions, Titus Livius turns it to account, and treats the subject at
large and in pregnant words, where he says, that since it was Heaven’s
will, for ends of its own, that the Romans should feel its power, it
first of all caused these Fabii, who were sent as envoys to the Gauls,
to act amiss, and then by their misconduct stirred up the Gauls to make
war on Rome; and, lastly, so ordered matters that nothing worthy of
their name was done by the Romans to withstand their attack. For it was
fore-ordained by Heaven that Camillus, who alone could supply the
remedy to so mighty an evil, should be banished to Ardea; and again,
that the citizens, who had often created a dictator to meet attacks of
the Volscians and other neighbouring hostile nations, should fail to do
so when the Gauls were marching upon Rome. Moreover, the army which the
Romans got together was but a weak one, since they used no signal
effort to make it strong; nay, were so dilatory in arming that they
were barely in time to meet the enemy at the river Allia, though no
more than ten miles distant from Rome. Here, again, the Roman tribunes
pitched their camp without observing any of the usual precautions,
attending neither to the choice of ground, nor to surround themselves
with trench or Palisade, nor to avail themselves of any other aid,
human or Divine. In ordering their army for battle, moreover, disposed
it in weak columns, and these far apart: so that neither men nor
officers accomplished anything worthy of the Roman discipline. The
battle was bloodless for the Romans fled before they were attacked;
most of them retreating to Veii, the rest to Rome, where, without
turning aside to visit their homes, they made straight for the Capitol.

Meanwhile, the senate, so far from bethinking themselves how they might
defend the city, did not even attend to closing the gates; and while
some of them made their escape from Rome, others entered the Capitol
along with those who sought shelter there. It was only in the defence
of the Capitol that any method was observed, measures being taken to
prevent it being crowded with useless numbers, and all the victual
which could be got, being brought into it to enable it to stand a
siege. Of the women, the children, and the men whose years unfitted
them for service, the most part fled for refuge to the neighbouring
towns, the rest remained in Rome a prey to the invaders; so that no one
who had heard of the achievements of the Romans in past years, on being
told of what took place on this occasion, could have believed that it
was of the same people that things so contrary were related.

Wherefore, Titus Livius, after setting forth all these disorders,
concludes with the words, “_So far does Fortune darken men’s minds when
she would not have her ascendency gainsaid._” Nor could any juster
observation be made. And hence it is that those who experience the
extremes whether of good or of evil fortune, are, commonly, little
deserving either of praise or blame; since it is apparent that it is
from Heaven having afforded them, or denied them opportunities for
acting worthily, that they have been brought to their greatness or to
their undoing. Fortune, doubtless, when she seeks to effect great ends,
will often choose as her instrument a man of such sense and worth that
he can recognize the opportunities which she holds out to him; and, in
like manner, when she desires to bring about great calamities, will put
forward such men as will of themselves contribute to that result. And
all who stand in her way, she either removes by death, or deprives of
the means of effecting good. And it is well seen in the passage we are
considering, how Fortune, to aggrandize Rome, and raise her to the
height she reached, judged it necessary, as shall be more fully shown
in the following Book, to humble her; yet would not have her utterly
undone. For which reason we find her causing Camillus to be banished,
but not put to death; suffering Rome to be taken, but not the Capitol;
and bringing it to pass that, while the Romans took no wise precaution
for the defence of their city, they neglected none in defending their
citadel. That Rome might be taken, Fortune caused the mass of the army,
after the rout at the Allia, to direct its flight to Veii, thus
withdrawing the means wherewith the city might have been defended; but
while thus disposing matters, she at the same time prepared all the
needful steps for its recovery, in bringing an almost entire Roman
array to Veii, and Camillus to Ardea, so that a great force might be
assembled for the rescue of their country, under a captain in no way
compromised by previous reverses, but, on the contrary, in the
enjoyment of an untarnished renown. I might cite many modern instances
to confirm these opinions, but since enough has been said to convince
any fair mind, I pass them over. But once more I repeat what, from all
history, may be seen to be most true, that men may aid Fortune, but not
withstand her; may interweave their threads with her web, but cannot
break it But, for all that, they must never lose heart, since not
knowing what their end is to be, and moving towards it by cross-roads
and untravelled paths, they have always room for hope, and ought never
to abandon it, whatsoever befalls, and into whatsoever straits they
come.




CHAPTER XXX.—_That really powerful Princes and, Commonwealths do not
buy Friendships with Money, but with their Valour and the Fame of their
Prowess_.


When besieged in the Capitol, the Romans although expecting succour
from Veii and from Camillus, nevertheless, being straitened by famine,
entered into an agreement to buy off the Gauls with gold But at the
very moment when, in pursuance of this agreement, the gold was being
weighed out, Camillus came up with his army. This, says our historian,
was contrived by Fortune, “_that the Romans might not live thereafter
as men ransomed for a price,_” and the matter is noteworthy, not only
with reference to this particular occasion, but also as it bears on the
methods generally followed by this republic. For we never find Rome
seeking to acquire towns, or to purchase peace with money, but always
confiding in her own warlike valour, which could not, I believe, be
said of any other republic.

Now, one of the tests whereby to gauge the strength of any State, is to
observe on what terms it lives with its neighbours: for when it so
carries itself that, to secure its friendship, its neighbours pay it
tribute, this is a sure sign of its strength, but when its neighbours,
though of less reputation, receive payments from it, this is a clear
proof of its weakness In the course of the Roman history we read how
the Massilians, the Eduans, the Rhodians, Hiero of Syracuse, the Kings
Eumenes and Massinissa, all of them neighbours to the Roman frontiers,
in order to secure the friendship of Rome, submitted to imposts and
tribute whenever Rome had need of them, asking no return save her
protection. But with a weak State we find the reverse of all this
happening And, to begin with our own republic of Florence, we know that
in times past, when she was at the height of her renown, there was
never a lordling of Romagna who had not a subsidy from her, to say
nothing of what she paid to the Perugians, to the Castellans, and to
all her other neighbours But had our city been armed and strong, the
direct contrary would have been the case, for, to obtain her
protection, all would have poured money into her lap, not seeking to
sell their friendship but to purchase hers.

Nor are the Florentines the only people who have lived on this
dishonourable footing The Venetians have done the same, nay, the King
of France himself, for all his great dominions, lives tributary to the
Swiss and to the King of England; and this because the French king and
the others named, with a view to escape dangers rather imaginary than
real, have disarmed their subjects; seeking to reap a present gain by
wringing money from them, rather than follow a course which would
secure their own safety and the lasting welfare of their country. Which
ill-practices of theirs, though they quiet things for a time, must in
the end exhaust their resources, and give rise in seasons of danger to
incurable mischief and disorder. It would be tedious to count up how
often in the course of their wars, the Florentines, the Venetians, and
the kingdom of France have had to ransom themselves from their enemies,
and to submit to an ignominy to which, once only, the Romans were very
near being subjected. It would be tedious, too, to recite how many
towns have been bought by the Florentines and by the Venetians, which,
afterwards, have only been a trouble to them, from their not knowing
how to defend with iron what they had won with gold. While the Romans
continued free they adhered to this more generous and noble method, but
when they came under the emperors, and these, again, began to
deteriorate, and to love the shade rather than the sunshine, they also
took to purchasing peace, now from the Parthians, now from the Germans,
and at other times from other neighbouring nations. And this was the
beginning of the decline of their great empire.

Such are the evils that befall when you withhold arms from your
subjects; and this course is attended by the still greater
disadvantage, that the closer an enemy presses you the weaker he finds
you. For any one who follows the evil methods of which I speak, must,
in order to support troops whom he thinks can be trusted to keep off
his enemies, be very exacting in his dealings with those of his
subjects who dwell in the heart of his dominions; since, to widen the
interval between himself and his enemies, he must subsidize those
princes and peoples who adjoin his frontiers. States maintained on this
footing may make a little resistance on their confines; but when these
are passed by the enemy no further defence remains. Those who pursue
such methods as these seem not to perceive that they are opposed to
reason and common sense. For the heart and vital parts of the body, not
the extremities, are those which we should keep guarded, since we may
live on without the latter, but must die if the former be hurt. But the
States of which I speak, leaving the heart undefended, defend only the
hands and feet. The mischief which has thus been, and is at this day
wrought in Florence is plain enough to see. For so soon as an enemy
penetrates within her frontiers, and approaches her heart, all is over
with her. And the same was witnessed a few years ago in the case of the
Venetians, whose city, had it not been girdled by the sea, must then
have found its end. In France, indeed, a like result has not been seen
so often, she being so great a kingdom as to have few enemies mightier
than herself. Nevertheless, when the English invaded France in the year
1513, the whole kingdom tottered; and the King himself, as well as
every one else, had to own that a single defeat might have cost him his
dominions.

But with the Romans the reverse of all this took place. For the nearer
an enemy approached Rome, the more completely he found her armed for
resistance; and accordingly we see that on the occasion of Hannibal’s
invasion of Italy, the Romans, after three defeats, and after the
slaughter of so many of their captains and soldiers, were still able,
not merely to withstand the invader, but even, in the end, to come off
victorious. This we may ascribe to the heart being well guarded, while
the extremities were but little heeded. For the strength of Rome rested
on the Roman people themselves, on the Latin league, on the confederate
towns of Italy, and on her colonies, from all of which sources she drew
so numerous an army, as enabled her to subdue the whole world and to
keep it in subjection.

The truth of what I say may be further seen from the question put by
Hanno the Carthaginian to the messengers sent to Carthage by Hannibal
after his victory at Cannæ. For when these were vaunting the
achievements of Hannibal, they were asked by Hanno whether any one had
come forward on behalf of the Romans to propose terms of peace, and
whether any town of the Latin league or of the colonized districts had
revolted from the Romans. And when to both inquiries the envoys
answered, “No,” Hanno observed that the war was no nearer an end than
on the day it was begun.

We can understand, therefore, as well from what has now been said, as
from what I have often said before, how great a difference there is
between the methods followed by the republics of the present times, and
those followed by the republics of antiquity; and why it is that we see
every day astounding losses alternate with extraordinary gains. For
where men are weak, Fortune shows herself strong; and because she
changes, States and Governments change with her; and will continue to
change, until some one arise, who, following reverently the example of
the ancients, shall so control her, that she shall not have opportunity
with every revolution of the sun to display anew the greatness of her
power.




CHAPTER XXXI.—_Of the Danger of trusting banished Men._


The danger of trusting those who are in exile from their own country,
being one to which the rulers of States are often exposed, may, I
think, be fitly considered in these Discourses; and I notice it the
more willingly, because I am able to illustrate it by a memorable
instance which Titus Livius, though with another purpose, relates in
his history. When Alexander the Great passed with his army into Asia,
his brother-in-law and uncle, Alexander of Epirus, came with another
army into Italy, being invited thither by the banished Lucanians, who
gave him to believe that, with their aid, he might get possession of
the whole of that country. But when, confiding in the promises of these
exiles, and fed by the hopes they held out to him, he came into Italy,
they put him to death, their fellow-citizens having offered to restore
them to their country upon this condition. It behoves us, therefore, to
remember how empty are the promises, and how doubtful the faith, of men
in banishment from their native land. For as to their faith, it may be
assumed that whenever they can effect their return by other means than
yours, notwithstanding any covenants they may have made with you, they
will throw you over, and take part with their countrymen. And as for
the empty promises and delusive hopes which they set before you, so
extreme is their desire to return home that they naturally believe many
things which are untrue, and designedly misrepresent many others; so
that between their beliefs and what they say they believe, they fill
you with false impressions, on which if you build, your labour is in
vain, and you are led to engage in enterprises from which nothing but
ruin can result.

To this instance of Alexander I shall add only one other, that, namely,
of Themistocles the Athenian, who, being proclaimed a traitor, fled
into Asia to Darius, to whom he made such lavish promises if he would
only attack Greece, that he induced him to undertake the enterprise.
But afterwards, when he could not fulfil what he had promised, either
from shame, or through fear of punishment, he poisoned himself. But, if
such a mistake as this was made by a man like Themistocles, we may
reckon that mistakes still greater will be made by those who, being of
a feebler nature, suffer themselves to be more completely swayed by
their feelings and wishes Wherefore, let a prince be careful how he
embarks in any enterprise on the representations of an exile; for
otherwise, he is likely either to be put to shame, or to incur the
gravest calamities.

Because towns are sometimes, though seldom, taken by craft, through
secret practices had with their inhabitants, I think it not out of
place to discuss the matter in the following Chapter, wherein I shall
likewise show in how many ways the Romans were wont to make such
acquisitions.




CHAPTER XXXII.—_In how many Ways the Romans gained Possession of
Towns._


Turning their thoughts wholly to arms, the Romans always conducted
their military enterprises in the most advantageous way, both as to
cost and every other circumstance of war. For which reason they avoided
attempting towns by siege, judging the expense and inconvenience of
this method of carrying on war greatly to outweigh any advantage to be
gained by it. Accordingly, they thought it better and more for their
interest to reduce towns in any other way than this; and in all those
years during which they were constantly engaged in wars we find very
few instances of their proceeding by siege.

For the capture of towns, therefore, they trusted either to assault or
to surrender. Assaults were effected either by open force, or by force
and stratagem combined. When a town was assailed by open force, the
walls were stormed without being breached, and the assailants were said
“_aggredi urbem corona,_” because they encircled the city with their
entire strength and kept up an attack on all sides. In this way they
often succeeded in carrying towns, and even great towns, at a first
onset, as when Scipio took new Carthage in Spain. But when they failed
to carry a town by storm, they set themselves to breach the walls with
battering rams and other warlike engines; or they dug mines so as to
obtain an entrance within the walls, this being the method followed in
taking Veii; or else, to be on a level with the defenders, they erected
towers of timber or threw up mounds of earth against the outside of the
walls so as to reach the top.

Of these methods of attack, the first, wherein the city was entirely
surrounded, exposed the defenders to more sudden perils and left them
more doubtful remedies. For while it was necessary for them to have a
sufficient force at all points, it might happen that the forces at
their disposal were not numerous enough to be everywhere at once, or to
relieve one another. Or if their numbers were sufficient, they might
not all be equally resolute in standing their ground, and their failure
at any one point involved a general defeat. Consequently, as I have
said, this method of attack was often successful. But when it did not
succeed at the first, it was rarely renewed, being a method dangerous
to the attacking army, which having to secure itself along an extended
line, was left everywhere too weak to resist a sally made from the
town; nay, of itself, was apt to fall into confusion and disorder. This
method of attack, therefore, could be attempted once only and by way of
surprise.

Against breaches in the walls the defence was, as at the present day,
to throw up new works; while mines were met by counter-mines, in which
the enemy were either withstood at the point of the sword, or baffled
by some other warlike contrivance; as by filling casks with feathers,
which, being set on fire and placed in the mine, choked out the
assailants by their smoke and stench. Where towers were employed for
the attack, the defenders sought to destroy them with fire; and where
mounds of earth were thrown up against the walls, they would dig holes
at the base of the wall against which the mound rested, and carry off
the earth which the enemy were heaping up; which, being removed from
within as fast as it was thrown up from without, the mound made no
progress.

None of these methods of attack can long be persisted in and the
assailant, if unsuccessful, must either strike his camp and seek
victory in some other direction, as Scipio did when he invaded Africa
and, after failing in the attempt to storm Utica, withdrew from his
attack on that town and turned his strength against the Carthaginian
army in the field; or else recourse must be had to regular siege, as by
the Romans at Veii, Capua, Carthage, Jerusalem, and divers other cities
which they reduced in this way.

The capture of towns by stratagem combined with force is effected, as
by the Romans at Palæopolis, through a secret understanding with some
within the walls. Many attempts of this sort have been made, both by
the Romans and by others, but few successfully, because the least
hindrance disarranges the plan of action, and because such hindrances
are very likely to occur. For either the plot is discovered before it
can be carried out, as it readily may, whether from treachery on the
part of those to whom it has been communicated, or from the
difficulties which attend its inception, the preliminary arrangements
having to be made with the enemy and with persons with whom it is not
permitted, save under some pretext or other, to hold intercourse; or if
it be not discovered while it is being contrived, a thousand
difficulties will still be met with in its execution. For if you arrive
either before or after the appointed time, all is ruined. The faintest
sound, as of the cackling of the geese in the Capitol, the least
departure from some ordinary routine, the most trifling mistake or
error, mars the whole enterprise. Add to which, the darkness of night
lends further terror to the perils of such undertakings; while the
great majority of those engaged in them, having no knowledge of the
district or places into which they are brought, are bewildered and
disconcerted by the least mishap, and put to flight by every imaginary
danger. In secret nocturnal enterprises of this sort, no man was ever
more successful than Aratus of Sicyon, although in any encounter by day
there never was a more arrant coward. This we must suppose due rather
to some special and occult quality inherent in the man, than to success
being naturally to be looked for in the like attempts. Such
enterprises, accordingly, are often planned, but few are put into
execution, and fewer still with success.

When cities are acquired by surrender, the surrender is either
voluntary or under compulsion; voluntary, when the citizens appeal to
you for protection against some threatened danger from without, as
Capua submitted to the Romans; or where they are moved by a desire to
be better governed, and are attracted by the good government which he
to whom they surrender is seen exercising over others who have placed
themselves in his hands; as was the case with the Rhodians, the
Massilians, and others who for like causes gave themselves up to the
Roman people. Compulsory surrenders take place, either as the result of
a protracted siege, like those we have spoken of above; or from the
country being continually wasted by incursions, forays, and similar
severities, to escape which a city makes its submission.

Of the methods which have been noticed, the Romans, in preference to
all others, used this last; and for four hundred and fifty years made
it their aim to wear out their neighbours by invasion and by defeat in
the open field, while endeavouring, as I have elsewhere said, to
establish their influence over them by treaties and conventions. It was
to this method of warfare therefore that they always mainly trusted,
because, after trying all others, they found none so free from
inconvenience and disadvantage—the procedure by siege involving expense
and delay, that by assault, difficulty and danger, and that by secret
practice, uncertainty and doubt. They found, likewise, that while in
subduing one obstinate city by siege many years might be wasted, a
kingdom might be gained in a single day by the defeat of a hostile army
in the field.




CHAPTER XXXIII.—_That the Romans intrusted the Captains of their Armies
with the fullest Powers._


In reading this History of Titus Livius with a view to profit by it, I
think that all the methods of conduct followed by the Roman people and
senate merit attention. And among other things fit to be considered, it
should be noted, with how ample an authority they sent forth their
consuls, their dictators, and the other captains of their armies, all
of whom we find clothed with the fullest powers: no other prerogative
being reserved to itself by the senate save that of declaring war and
making peace, while everything else was left to the discretion and
determination of the consul. For so soon as the people and senate had
resolved on war, for instance on a war against the Latins, they threw
all further responsibility upon the consul, who might fight or decline
battle as he pleased, and attack this or the other city as he thought
fit.

That this was so, is seen in many instances, and especially from what
happened during an expedition made against the Etruscans. For the
consul Fabius having routed that people near Sutrium, and thinking to
pass onward through the Ciminian forest into Etruria, so far from
seeking the advice of the senate, gave them no hint whatever of his
design, although for its execution the war had to be carried into a
new, difficult, and dangerous country. We have further witness to the
same effect, in the action taken in respect of this enterprise by the
senate, who being informed of the victory obtained by Fabius, and
apprehending that he might decide to pass onward through the aforesaid
forest, and deeming it inexpedient that he should incur risk by
attempting this invasion, sent two messengers to warn him not to enter
Etruria. These messengers, however, did not come up with the consul
until he had already made his way into that country and gained a second
victory; when, instead of opposing his further advance, they returned
to Rome to announce his good fortune and the glory which he had won.

Whoever, therefore, shall well consider the character of the authority
whereof I speak, will see that it was most wisely accorded; since had
it been the wish of the senate that a consul, in conducting a war,
should proceed step by step as they might direct him, this must have
made him at once less cautious and more dilatory; because the credit of
victory would not then have seemed to be wholly his own, but shared by
the senate on whose advice he acted. Besides which, the senate must
have taken upon itself the task of advising on matters which it could
not possibly understand; for although it might contain among its
members all who were most versed in military affairs, still, since
these men were not on the spot, and were ignorant of many particulars
which, if they were to give sound advice, it was necessary for them to
know, they must in advising have made numberless mistakes. For these
reasons they desired that the consul should act on his own
responsibility, and that the honours of success should be wholly his;
judging that the love of fame would act on him at once as a spur and as
a curb, making him do whatever he had to do well.

This matter I have the rather dwelt upon because I observe that our
modern republics, such as the Venetian and the Florentine, view it in a
different light; so that when their captains, commissaries, or
_provedditori_ have a single gun to place in position, the authorities
at home must be informed and consulted; a course deserving the same
approval as is due to all those other methods of theirs, which, one
with another, have brought Italy to her present condition.




BOOK III.




CHAPTER I.—_For a Sect or Commonwealth to last long, it must often be
brought back to its Beginnings._


Doubtless, all the things of this world have a limit set to their
duration; yet those of them the bodies whereof have not been suffered
to grow disordered, but have been so cared for that either no change at
all has been wrought in them, or, if any, a change for the better and
not for the worse, will run that course which Heaven has in a general
way appointed them. And since I am now speaking of mixed bodies, for
States and Sects are so to be regarded, I say that for them these are
wholesome changes which bring them back to their first beginnings.

Those States consequently stand surest and endure longest which, either
by the operation of their institutions can renew themselves, or come to
be renewed by accident apart from any design. Nothing, however, can be
clearer than that unless thus renewed these bodies do not last. Now the
way to renew them is, as I have said, to bring them back to their
beginnings, since all beginnings of sects, commonwealths, or kingdoms
must needs have in them a certain excellence, by virtue of which they
gain their first reputation and make their first growth. But because in
progress of time this excellence becomes corrupted, unless something be
done to restore it to what it was at first, these bodies necessarily
decay; for as the physicians tell us in speaking of the human body,
“_Something or other is daily added which sooner or later will require
treatment._”[10]

 [10] “Quod quotidie aggregatur aliquid quod quandoque indiget
 curatione.”


As regards commonwealths, this return to the point of departure is
brought about either by extrinsic accident or by intrinsic foresight.
As to the first, we have seen how it was necessary that Rome should be
taken by the Gauls, that being thus in a manner reborn, she might
recover life and vigour, and resume the observances of religion and
justice which she had suffered to grow rusted by neglect. This is well
seen from those passages of Livius wherein he tells us that when the
Roman army was ‘sent forth against the Gauls, and again when tribunes
were created with consular authority, no religious rites whatever were
celebrated, and wherein he further relates how the Romans not only
failed to punish the three Fabii, who contrary to the law of nations
had fought against the Gauls, but even clothed them with honour. For,
from these instances, we may well infer that the rest of the wise
ordinances instituted by Romulus, and the other prudent kings, had
begun to be held of less account than they deserved, and less than was
essential for the maintenance of good government.

And therefore it was that Rome was visited by this calamity from
without, to the end that all her ordinances might be reformed, and the
people taught that it behoved them not only to maintain religion and
justice, but also to esteem their worthy citizens, and to prize their
virtues beyond any advantages of which they themselves might seem to
have been deprived at their instance. And this, we find, was just the
effect produced. For no sooner was the city retaken, than all the
ordinances of the old religion were at once restored; the Fabii, who
had fought in violation of the law of nations, were punished; and the
worth and excellence of Camillus so fully recognized, that the senate
and the whole people, laying all jealousies aside, once more committed
to him the entire charge of public affairs.

It is necessary then, as I have said already, that where men dwell
together in a regulated society, they be often reminded of those
ordinances in conformity with which they ought to live, either by
something inherent in these, or else by some external accident. A
reminder is given in the former of these two ways, either by the
passing of some law whereby the members of the society are brought to
an account; or else by some man of rare worth arising among them, whose
virtuous life and example have the same effect as a law. In a
Commonwealth, accordingly, this end is served either by the virtues of
some one of its citizens, or by the operation of its institutions.

The institutions whereby the Roman Commonwealth was led back to its
starting point, were the tribuneship of the people and the censorship,
together with all those laws which were passed to check the insolence
and ambition of its citizens. Such institutions, however, require fresh
life to be infused into them by the worth of some one man who
fearlessly devotes himself to give them effect in opposition to the
power of those who set them at defiance.

Of the laws being thus reinforced in Rome, before its capture by the
Gauls, we have notable examples in the deaths of the sons of Brutus, of
the Decemvirs, and of Manlius Frumentarius; and after its capture, in
the deaths of Manlius Capitolinus, and of the son of Manlius Torquatus
in the prosecution of his master of the knights by Papirius Cursor, and
in the impeachment of the Scipios. Such examples as these, being signal
and extraordinary, had the effect, whenever they took place, of
bringing men back to the true standard of right; but when they came to
be of rarer occurrence, they left men more leisure to grow corrupted,
and were attended by greater danger and disturbance. Wherefore, between
one and another of these vindications of the laws, no more than ten
years, at most, ought to intervene; because after that time men begin
to change their manners and to disregard the laws; and if nothing occur
to recall the idea of punishment, and unless fear resume its hold on
their minds, so many offenders suddenly spring up together that it is
impossible to punish them without danger. And to this purport it used
to be said by those who ruled Florence from the year 1434 to 1494, that
their government could hardly be maintained unless it was renewed every
five years; by which they meant that it was necessary for them to
arouse the same terror and alarm in men’s minds, as they inspired when
they first assumed the government, and when all who offended against
their authority were signally chastised. For when the recollection of
such chastisement has died out, men are emboldened to engage in new
designs, and to speak ill of their rulers; for which the only remedy is
to restore things to what they were at first.

A republic may, likewise, be brought back to its original form, without
recourse to ordinances for enforcing justice, by the mere virtues of a
single citizen, by reason that these virtues are of such influence and
authority that good men love to imitate them, and bad men are ashamed
to depart from them. Those to whom Rome owed most for services of this
sort, were Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scævola, the two Decii, Atilius
Regulus, and divers others, whose rare excellence and generous example
wrought for their city almost the same results as might have been
effected by ordinances and laws. And if to these instances of
individual worth had been added, every ten years, some signal
enforcement of justice, it would have been impossible for Rome ever to
have grown corrupted. But when both of these incitements to virtuous
behavior began to recur less frequently, corruption spread, and after
the time of Atilius Regulus, no like example was again witnessed. For
though the two Catos came later, so great an interval had elapsed
before the elder Cato appeared, and again, so long a period intervened
between him and the younger, and these two, moreover, stood so much
alone, that it was impossible for them, by their influence, to work any
important change; more especially for the younger, who found Rome so
much corrupted that he could do nothing to improve his fellow-citizens.

This is enough to say concerning commonwealths, but as regards sects,
we see from the instance of our own religion that here too a like
renewal is needed. For had not this religion of ours been brought back
to its original condition by Saint Francis and Saint Dominick, it must
soon have been utterly extinguished. They, however, by their voluntary
poverty, and by their imitation of the life of Christ, rekindled in the
minds of men the dying flame of faith; and by the efficacious rules
which they established averted from our Church that ruin which the ill
lives of its prelates and heads must otherwise have brought upon it.
For living in poverty, and gaining great authority with the people by
confessing them and preaching to them, they got them to believe that it
is evil to speak ill even of what is evil; and that it is good to be
obedient to rulers, who, if they do amiss, may be left to the judgment
of God. By which teaching these rulers are encouraged to behave as
badly as they can, having no fear of punishments which they neither see
nor credit. Nevertheless, it is this renewal which has maintained, and
still maintains, our religion.

Kingdoms also stand in need of a like renewal, and to have their laws
restored to their former force; and we see how, by attending to this,
the kingdom of France has profited. For that kingdom, more than any
other, lies under the control of its laws and ordinances, which are
maintained by its parliaments, and more especially by the parliament of
Paris, from which last they derive fresh vigour whenever they have to
be enforced against any prince of the realm; for this assembly
pronounces sentence even against the king himself. Heretofore this
parliament has maintained its name as the fearless champion of the laws
against the nobles of the land; but should it ever at any future time
suffer wrongs to pass unpunished, and should offences multiply, either
these will have to be corrected with great disturbance to the State, or
the kingdom itself must fall to pieces.

This, then, is our conclusion—that nothing is so necessary in any
society, be it a religious sect, a kingdom, or a commonwealth, as to
restore to it that reputation which it had at first, and to see that it
is provided either with wholesome laws, or with good men whose actions
may effect the same ends, without need to resort to external force. For
although this last may sometimes, as in the case of Rome, afford an
efficacious remedy, it is too hazardous a remedy to make us ever wish
to employ it.

And that all may understand how much the actions of particular citizens
helped to make Rome great, and how many admirable results they wrought
in that city, I shall now proceed to set them forth and examine them;
with which survey this Third Book of mine, and last division of the
First Decade of Titus Livius, shall be brought to a close. But,
although great and notable actions were done by the Roman kings,
nevertheless, since history has treated of these at much length, here I
shall pass them over, and say no more about these princes, save as
regards certain things done by them with an eye to their private
interest. I shall begin, therefore, with Brutus, the father of Roman
freedom.




CHAPTER II.—_That on occasion it is wise to feign Folly._


Never did any man by the most splendid achievements gain for himself so
great a name for wisdom and prudence as is justly due to Junius Brutus
for feigning to be a fool. And although Titus Livius mentions one cause
only as having led him to assume this part, namely, that he might live
more securely and look after his patrimony; yet on considering his
behavior we may believe that in counterfeiting folly it was also his
object to escape notice, and so find better convenience to overthrow
the kings, and to free his country whenever an occasion offered. That
this was in his mind is seen first of all from the interpretation he
gave to the oracle of Apollo, when, to render the gods favourable to
his designs, he pretended to stumble, and secretly kissed his mother
earth; and, again, from this, that on the death of Lucretia, though her
father, her husband, and others of her kinsmen were present, he was the
first to draw the dagger from her wound, and bind the bystanders by
oath never more to suffer king to reign in Rome.

From his example all who are discontented with their prince are taught,
first of all, to measure, and to weigh their strength, and if they find
themselves strong enough to disclose their hostility and proclaim open
war, then to take that course as at once the nobler and less dangerous;
but, if too weak to make open war, then sedulously to court the favour
of the prince, using to that end all such methods as they may judge
needful, adapting themselves to his pleasures, and showing delight in
whatever they see him delight in. Such an intimacy, in the first place,
enables you to live securely, and permits you, without incurring any
risk, to share the happy fortunes of the prince, while it affords you
every facility for carrying out your plans. Some, no doubt, will tell
you that you should not stand so near the prince as to be involved in
his downfall; nor yet at such a distance that when he falls you shall
be too far off to use the occasion for rising on his ruin. But although
this mean course, could we only follow it, were certainly the best,
yet, since I believe it to be impracticable, we must resort to the
methods above indicated, and either keep altogether aloof, or else
cleave closely to the prince. Whosoever does otherwise, if he be of
great station, lives in constant peril; nor will it avail him to say,
“I concern myself with nothing; I covet neither honours nor preferment;
my sole wish is to live a quiet and peaceful life.” For such excuses,
though they be listened to, are not accepted; nor can any man of great
position, however much and sincerely he desire it, elect to live this
life of tranquillity since his professions will not be believed; so
that although he might be contented to be let alone, others will not
suffer him to be so. Wherefore, like Brutus, men must feign folly; and
to play the part effectively, and so as to please their prince, must
say, do, see, and praise things contrary to their inclinations.

But now, having spoken of the prudence shown by Brutus when he sought
to recover the freedom of Rome, let us next speak of the severity which
he used to maintain it.




CHAPTER III.—_That to preserve a newly acquired Freedom we must slay
the Sons of Brutus._


The severity used by Brutus in preserving for Rome the freedom he had
won for her, was not less necessary than useful. The spectacle of a
father sitting on the judgment, and not merely sentencing his own sons
to death, but being himself present at their execution, affords an
example rare in history. But those who study the records of ancient
times will understand, that after a change in the form of a government,
whether it be from a commonwealth to a tyranny or from a tyranny to a
commonwealth, those who are hostile to the new order of things must
always be visited with signal punishment. So that he who sets up as a
tyrant and slays not Brutus, and he who creates a free government and
slays not the sons of Brutus, can never maintain himself long. But
since I have elsewhere treated of this matter at large, I shall merely
refer to what has there been said concerning it, and shall cite here
one instance only, happening in our own days, and memorable in the
history of our country.

I speak of Piero Soderini, who thought by his patience and goodness to
overcome the very same temper which prompted the sons of Brutus to
revert to the old government, and who failed in the endeavour. For
although his sagacity should have taught him the necessity, while
chance and the ambition of those who attacked him furnished him with
the opportunity of making an end of them, he never could resolve to
strike the blow; and not merely believed himself able to subdue
disaffection by patience and kindness, and to mitigate the enmity of
particular men by the rewards he held out to them, but also persuaded
himself, and often declared in the presence of his friends, that he
could not confront opposition openly, nor crush his adversaries,
without assuming extraordinary powers and passing laws destructive of
civil equality; which measures, although not afterward used by him for
tyrannical ends, would so alarm the community, that after his death
they would never again consent to appoint a Gonfalonier for life, an
office which he judged it essential both to maintain and strengthen.
Now although these scruples of his were wise and good, we ought never
out of regard for what is good, to suffer an evil to run its course,
since it may well happen that the evil will prevail over the good. And
Piero should have believed that as his acts and intentions were to be
judged by results, he might, if he lived and if fortune befriended him,
have made it clear to all, that what he did was done to preserve his
country, and not from personal ambition; and he might have so contrived
matters that no successor of his could ever turn to bad ends the means
which he had used for good ends. But he was misled by a preconceived
opinion, and failed to understand that ill-will is not to be vanquished
by time nor propitiated by favours. And, so, from not knowing how to
resemble Brutus, he lost power, and fame, and was driven an exile from
his country.

That it is as hard a matter to preserve a princedom as it is to
preserve a commonwealth, will be shown in the Chapter following.




CHAPTER IV.—_That an Usurper is never safe in his Princedom while those
live whom he has deprived of it._


From what befell the elder Tarquin at the hands of the sons of Ancus,
and Servius Tullius at the hands of Tarquin the Proud, we see what an
arduous and perilous course it is to strip a king of his kingdom and
yet suffer him to live on, hoping to conciliate him by benefits. We
see, too, how the elder Tarquin was ruined by his belief that he held
the kingdom by a just title, since it had been given him by the people
and confirmed to him by the senate, never suspecting that the sons of
Ancus would be so stirred by resentment that it would be impossible to
content them with what contented all the rest of Rome. Servius Tullius
again, was ruined through believing that he could conciliate the sons
of Ancus by loading them with favours.

By the fate of the first of these kings every prince may be warned that
he can never live securely in his princedom so long as those from whom
he has taken it survive; while the fate of the second should remind all
rulers that old injuries are not to be healed by subsequent benefits,
and least of all when the new benefit is less in degree than the injury
suffered. And, truly, Servius was wanting in wisdom when he imagined
that the sons of Tarquin would contentedly resign themselves to be the
sons-in-law of one whom they thought should be their subject. For the
desire to reign is so prevailing a passion, that it penetrates the
minds not only of those who are rightful heirs, but also of those who
are not; as happened with the wife of the younger Tarquin, who was
daughter to Servius, but who, possessed by this madness, and setting at
naught all filial duty, incited her husband to take her father’s
kingdom, and with it his life; so much nobler did she esteem it to be a
queen than the daughter of a king. But while the elder Tarquin and
Servius Tullius lost the kingdom from not knowing how to secure
themselves against those whom they had deprived of it, the younger
Tarquin lost it from not observing the ordinances of the old kings, as
shall be shown in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER V.—_How an Hereditary King may come to lose his Kingdom._


Tarquin the Proud, when he had put Servius Tullius to death, inasmuch
as the latter left no heirs, took secure possession of the kingdom,
having nothing to fear from any of those dangers which had stood in the
way of his predecessors. And although the means whereby he made himself
king were hateful and monstrous, nevertheless, had he adhered to the
ancient ordinances of the earlier kings, he might have been endured,
nor would he have aroused both senate and people to combine against him
and deprive him of his government. It was not, therefore, because his
son Sextus violated Lucretia that Tarquin was driven out, but because
he himself had violated the laws of the kingdom, and governed as a
tyrant, stripping the senate of all authority, and bringing everything
under his own control. For all business which formerly had been
transacted in public, and with the sanction of the senate, he caused to
be transacted in his palace, on his own responsibility, and to the
displeasure of every one else, and so very soon deprived Rome of
whatever freedom she had enjoyed under her other kings.

Nor was it enough for him to have the Fathers his enemies, but he must
needs also kindle the commons against him, wearing them out with mere
mechanic labours, very different from the enterprises in which they had
been employed by his predecessors; so that when Rome overflowed with
instances of his cruelty and pride, he had already disposed the minds
of all the citizens to rebel whenever they found the opportunity.
Wherefore, had not occasion offered in the violence done to Lucretia,
some other had soon been found to bring about the same result. But had
Tarquin lived like the other kings, when Sextus his son committed that
outrage, Brutus and Collatinus would have had recourse to him to punish
the offender, and not to the commons of Rome. And hence let princes
learn that from the hour they first violate those laws, customs, and
usages under which men have lived for a great while, they begin to
weaken the foundations of their authority. And should they, after they
have been stripped of that authority, ever grow wise enough to see how
easily princedoms are preserved by those who are content to follow
prudent counsels, the sense of their loss will grieve them far more,
and condemn them to a worse punishment than any they suffer at the
hands of others. For it is far easier to be loved by good men than by
bad, and to obey the laws than to seek to control them.

And to learn what means they must use to retain their authority, they
have only to take example by the conduct of good princes, such as
Timoleon of Corinth, Aratus of Sicyone, and the like, in whose lives
they will find such security and content, both on the side of the ruler
and the ruled, as ought to stir them with the desire to imitate them,
which, for the reasons already given, it is easy for them to do. For
men, when they are well governed, ask no more, nor look for further
freedom; as was the case with the peoples governed by the two whom I
have named, whom they constrained to continue their rulers while they
lived, though both of them sought repeatedly to return to private life.

But because, in this and the two preceding Chapters, I have noticed the
ill-will which arose against the kings, the plots contrived by the sons
of Brutus against their country, and those directed against the elder
Tarquin and Servius Tullius, it seems to me not out of place to
discourse of these matters more at length in the following Chapter, as
deserving the attention both of princes and private citizens.




CHAPTER VI.—_Of Conspiracies._


It were an omission not to say something on the subject of
conspiracies, these being a source of much danger both to princes and
to private men. For we see that many more princes have lost their lives
and states through these than in open warfare; power to wage open war
upon a prince being conceded to few, whereas power to conspire against
him is denied to none. On the other hand, since conspiracies are
attended at every stage by difficulties and dangers, no more hazardous
or desperate undertakings can be engaged in by any private citizen;
whence it comes that while many conspiracies are planned, few effect
their object. Wherefore, to put princes on their guard against these
dangers, and to make subjects more cautious how they take part in them,
and rather learn to live content under whatever government fortune has
assigned them, I shall treat of them at length, without omitting any
noteworthy circumstance which may serve for the instruction of either.
Though, indeed, this is a golden sentence Of Cornelius Tacitus, wherein
he says that “_the past should have our reverence, the present our
obedience, and that we should wish for good princes, but put up with
any._”[11] For assuredly whosoever does otherwise is likely to bring
ruin both on himself and on his country.

 [11] _Tac. Hist._ iv. 8.


But, to go deeper into the matter, we have first of all to examine
against whom conspiracies are directed; and we shall find that men
conspire either against their country or their prince; and it is of
these two kinds of conspiracy that at present I desire to speak. For of
conspiracies which have for their object the surrender of cities to
enemies who are besieging them, and of all others contrived for like
ends, I have already said enough.

First, then, I shall treat of those conspiracies which are directed
against a prince, and begin by inquiring into their causes, which are
manifold, but of which one is more momentous than all the rest; I mean,
the being hated by the whole community. For it may reasonably be
assumed, that when a prince has drawn upon himself this universal
hatred, he must also have given special offence to particular men,
which they will be eager to avenge. And this eagerness will be
augmented by the feeling of general ill-will which the prince is seen
to have incurred. A prince ought, therefore, to avoid this load of
public hatred. How he is to do so I need not stop here to explain,
having discussed the matter already in another place; but if he can
guard against this, offence given to particular men will expose him to
but few attacks. One reason being, that there are few men who think so
much of an injury done them as to run great risks to revenge it;
another, that assuming them to have both the disposition and the
courage to avenge themselves, they are restrained by the universal
favour which they see entertained towards the prince.

Injuries are either to a man’s life, to his property, or to his honour.
As regards the first, they who threaten injuries to life incur more
danger than they who actually inflict them; or rather, while great
danger is incurred in threatening, none at all is incurred from
inflicting such injuries. For the dead are past thinking of revenge;
and those who survive, for the most part leave such thoughts to the
dead. But he whose life is threatened, finding himself forced by
necessity either to do or suffer, becomes a man most dangerous to the
prince, as shall be fully explained hereafter.

After menaces to life, injuries to property and honour stir men more
than any others, and of these a Prince has most to beware. For he can
never strip a man so bare of his possessions as not to leave him some
weapon wherewith to redress his wrongs, nor ever so far dishonour him
as to quell the stubborn spirit which prompts revenge. Of all
dishonours those done to the women of a household are the worst; after
which come such personal indignities as nerved the arm of Pausanias
against Philip of Macedon, and of many another against other princes;
and, in our own days, it was no other reason that moved Giulio Belanti
to conspire against Pandolfo, lord of Siena, than that Pandolfo, who
had given him his daughter to wife, afterwards took her from him, as
presently shall be told. Chief among the causes which led the Pazzi to
conspire against the Medici, was the law passed by the latter depriving
them of the inheritance of Giovanni Bonromei.

Another most powerful motive to conspire against a prince is the desire
men feel to free their country from a usurper. This it was which
impelled Brutus and Cassius to conspire against Cæsar, and countless
others against such tyrants as Phalaris, Dionysius, and the like.
Against this humour no tyrant can guard, except by laying down his
tyranny; which as none will do, few escape an unhappy end. Whence the
verses of Juvenal:—

“Few tyrants die a peaceful death, and few
The kings who visit Proserpine’s dread lord,
Unscathed by wounds and blood.”[12]


 [12] Ad generum Cereris sine caede et vulnere pauci
Descendunt reges, et sicca morte tiranni.
          _Juv. Sat._ x. 112.


Great, as I have said already, are the dangers which men run in
conspiring; for at all times they are in peril, whether in contriving,
in executing, or after execution. And since in conspiracies either many
are engaged, or one only (for although it cannot properly be said of
_one_ man that he _conspires_, there may exist in him the fixed resolve
to put the prince to death), it is only the solitary plotter who
escapes the first of these three stages of danger. For he runs no risk
before executing his design, since as he imparts it to none, there is
none to bring it to the ear of the prince. A deliberate resolve like
this may be conceived by a person in any rank of life, high or low,
base or noble, and whether or no he be the familiar of his prince. For
every one must, at some time or other, have leave to speak to the
prince, and whoever has this leave has opportunity to accomplish his
design. Pausanias, of whom we have made mention so often, slew Philip
of Macedon as he walked between his son and his son-in-law to the
temple, surrounded by a thousand armed guards. Pausanias indeed was
noble, and known to the prince, but Ferdinand of Spain was stabbed in
the neck by a poor and miserable Spaniard; and though the wound was not
mortal, it sufficed to show that neither courage nor opportunity were
wanting to the would-be-assassin. A Dervish, or Turkish priest, drew
his scimitar on Bajazet, father of the Sultan now reigning, and if he
did not wound him, it was from no lack either of daring or of
opportunity. And I believe that there are many who in their minds
desire the deed, no punishment or danger attending the mere wish,
though there be but few who dare do it. For since few or none who
venture, escape death, few are willing to go forward to certain
destruction.

But to pass from these solitary attempts to those in which several are
engaged, I affirm it to be shown by history that all such plots have
been contrived by men of great station, or by those who have been on
terms of close intimacy with the prince, since no others, not being
downright madmen, would ever think of conspiring. For men of humble
rank, and such as are not the intimates of their prince, are neither
fed by the hopes nor possessed of the opportunities essential for such
attempts. Because, in the first place, men of low degree will never
find any to keep faith with them, none being moved to join in their
schemes by those expectations which encourage men to run great risks;
wherefore, so soon as their design has been imparted to two or three,
they are betrayed and ruined. Or, assuming them fortunate enough to
have no traitor of their number, they will be so hampered in the
execution of their plot by the want of easy access to the prince, that
they are sure to perish in the mere attempt. For if even men of great
position, who have ready access to the prince, succumb to the
difficulties which I shall presently notice, those difficulties must be
infinitely increased in the case of men who are without these
advantages. And because when life and property are at stake men are not
utterly reckless, on perceiving themselves to be weak they grow
cautious, and though cursing the tyrant in their hearts, are content to
endure him, and to wait until some one of higher station than they,
comes forward to redress their wrongs. So that should we ever find
these weaklings attempting anything, we may commend their courage
rather than their prudence.

We see, however, that the great majority of conspirators have been
persons of position and the familiars of their prince, and that their
plots have been as often the consequence of excessive indulgence as of
excessive injury; as when Perennius conspired against Commodus,
Plautianus against Severus, and Sejanus against Tiberius; all of whom
had been raised by their masters to such wealth, honours, and
dignities, that nothing seemed wanting to their authority save the
imperial name. That they might not lack this also, they fell to
conspiring against their prince; but in every instance their
conspiracies had the end which their ingratitude deserved.

The only instance in recent times of such attempts succeeding, is the
conspiracy of Jacopo IV. d’Appiano against Messer Piero Gambacorti,
lord of Pisa. For Jacopo, who had been bred and brought up by Piero,
and loaded by him with honours, deprived him of his State. Similar to
this, in our own days, was the conspiracy of Coppola against King
Ferdinand of Aragon. For Coppola had reached such a pitch of power that
he seemed to himself to have everything but sovereignty; in seeking to
obtain which he lost his life; though if any plot entered into by a man
of great position could be expected to succeed, this certainly might,
being contrived, as we may say, by another king, and by one who had the
amplest opportunities for its accomplishment. But that lust of power
which blinds men to dangers darkened the minds of those to whom the
execution of the scheme was committed; who, had they only known how to
add prudence to their villainy, could hardly have missed their aim.

The prince, therefore, who would guard himself against plots, ought
more to fear those men to whom he has been too indulgent, than those to
whom he has done great wrongs. For the latter lack opportunities which
the former have in abundance; and the moving cause is equally strong in
both, lust of power being at least as strong a passion as lust of
revenge. Wherefore, a prince should entrust his friends with so much
authority only as leaves a certain interval between his position and
theirs; that between the two something be still left them to desire.
Otherwise it will be strange if he do not fare like those princes who
have been named above.

But to return from this digression, I say, that having shown it to be
necessary that conspirators should be men of great station, and such as
have ready access to the prince, we have next to consider what have
been the results of their plots, and to trace the causes which have
made them succeed or fail. Now, as I have said already, we find that
conspiracies are attended by danger at three stages: before during, and
after their execution; for which reason very few of them have had a
happy issue; it being next to impossible to surmount all these
different dangers successfully. And to begin with those which are
incurred beforehand, and which are graver than all the rest, I say that
he must be both very prudent and very fortunate who, when contriving a
conspiracy, does not suffer his secret to be discovered.

Conspiracies are discovered either by disclosures made, or by
conjecture. Disclosures are made through the treachery or folly of
those to whom you communicate your design. Treachery is to be looked
for, because you can impart your plans only to such persons as you
believe ready to face death on your behalf, or to those who are
discontented with the prince. Of men whom you can trust thus
implicitly, one or two may be found; but when you have to open your
designs to many, they cannot all be of this nature; and their goodwill
towards you must be extreme if they are not daunted by the danger and
by fear of punishment. Moreover men commonly deceive themselves in
respect of the love which they imagine others bear them, nor can ever
be sure of it until they have put it to the proof. But to make proof of
it in a matter like this is very perilous; and even if you have proved
it already, and found it true in some other dangerous trial, you cannot
assume that there will be the same fidelity here, since this far
transcends every other kind of danger. Again, if you gauge a man’s
fidelity by his discontent with the prince, you may easily deceive
yourself; for so soon as you have taken this discontented man into your
confidence, you have supplied him with the means whereby he may become
contented; so that either his hatred of the prince must be great
indeed, or your influence over him extraordinary, if it keep him
faithful. Hence it comes that so many conspiracies have been discovered
and crushed in their earliest stage, and that when the secret is
preserved among many accomplices for any length of time, it is looked
on as a miracle; as in the case of the conspiracy of Piso against Nero,
and, in our own days, in that of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano
de’ Medici; which last, though more than fifty persons were privy to
it, was not discovered until it came to be carried out.

Conspiracies are disclosed through the imprudence of a conspirator when
he talks so indiscreetly that some servant, or other person not in the
plot, overhears him; as happened with the sons of Brutus, who, when
treating with the envoys of Tarquin, were overheard by a slave, who
became their accuser; or else through your own weakness in imparting
your secret to some woman or boy whom you love, or to some other such
light person; as when Dymnus, who was one of those who conspired with
Philotas against Alexander the Great, revealed the plot to Nicomachus,
a youth whom he loved, who at once told Cebalinus, and Cebalinus the
king.

Of discoveries by conjecture we have an instance in the conspiracy of
Piso against Nero; for Scaevinus, one of the conspirators, the day
before he was to kill Nero, made his will, liberated all his slaves and
gave them money, and bade Milichus, his freedman, sharpen his old rusty
dagger, and have bandages ready for binding up wounds. From all which
preparations Milichus conjecturing what work was in hand, accused
Scaevinus before Nero; whereupon Scaevinus was arrested, and with him
Natalis, another of the conspirators, who the day before had been seen
to speak with him for a long time in private; and when the two differed
in their account of what then passed between them, they were put to the
torture and forced to confess the truth. In this way the conspiracy was
brought to light, to the ruin of all concerned.

Against these causes of the discovery of conspiracies it is impossible
so to guard as that either through treachery, want of caution, or
levity, the secret shall not be found out, whenever more than three or
four persons are privy to it. And whenever more than one conspirator is
arrested, the plot is certain to be detected, because no two persons
can perfectly agree in a false account of what has passed between them.
If only one be taken, should he be a man of resolute courage, he may
refuse to implicate his comrades; but they on their part must have no
less courage, to stay quiet where they are, and not betray themselves
by flight; for if courage be absent anywhere, whether in him who is
taken or in those still at large, the conspiracy is revealed. And what
is related by Titus Livius as having happened in the conspiracy against
Hieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, is most extraordinary, namely, that on
the capture of one of the conspirators, named Theodorus, he, with great
fortitude, withheld the names of all his accomplices, and accused
friends of the tyrant; while his companions, on their part, trusted so
completely in his courage, that not one of them quitted Syracuse or
showed any sign of fear.

All these dangers, therefore, which attend the contrivance of a plot,
must be passed through before you come to its execution; or if you
would escape them, you must observe the following precautions: Your
first and surest, nay, to say truth, your only safeguard, is to leave
your accomplices no time to accuse you; for which reason you must
impart the affair to them, only at the moment when you mean it to be
carried out, and not before. Those who have followed this course have
wholly escaped the preliminary dangers of conspiracies, and, generally
speaking, the others also; indeed, I may say that they have all
succeeded, and that it is open to every prudent man to act as they did.
It will be enough to give two instances of plots effected in this way.
Nelematus, unable to endure the tyranny of Aristotimus, despot of
Epirus, assembling many of his friends and kinsmen in his house,
exhorted them to free their country; and when some of them asked for
time to consider and mature their plans, he bade his slaves close the
doors, and told those assembled that unless they swore to go at once
and do as he directed he would make them over to Aristotimus as
prisoners. Alarmed by his threats, they bound themselves by a solemn
oath, and going forth at once and without delay, successfully carried
out his bidding. A certain Magus having fraudulently usurped the throne
of Persia; Ortanes, a grandee of that realm, discovering the fraud,
disclosed it to six others of the chief nobility, telling them that it
behoved them to free the kingdom from the tyranny of this impostor. And
when some among them asked for time, Darius, who was one of the six
summoned by Ortanes, stood up and said, “Either we go at once to do
this deed, or I go to the Magus to accuse you all.” Whereupon, all
rising together, without time given to any to change his mind, they
went forth and succeeded in effecting their end. Not unlike these
instances was the plan taken by the Etolians to rid themselves of
Nabis, the Spartan tyrant, to whom, under pretence of succouring him,
they sent Alasamenes, their fellow-citizen, with two hundred foot
soldiers and thirty horsemen. For they imparted their real design to
Alasamenes only, charging the rest, under pain of exile, to obey him in
whatever he commanded. Alasamenes repaired to Sparta, and never
divulged his commission till the time came for executing it; and so
succeeded in putting Nabis to death.

It was, therefore, by the precautions they observed, that the persons
of whom I have just now spoken escaped all those perils that attend the
contrivance of conspiracies; and any following their example may expect
the like good fortune. And that all may learn to do as they did I shall
notice the case of Piso, of which mention has before been made. By
reason of his rank, his reputation, and the intimate terms on which he
lived with Nero, who trusted him without reserve, and would often come
to his garden to sup with him, Piso was able to gain the friendship of
many persons of spirit and courage, and well fitted in every way to
take part in his plot against the emperor, which, under these
circumstances, might easily have been carried out. For when Nero came
to his garden, Piso could readily have communicated his design to those
friends of his, and with suitable words have encouraged them to do
what, in fact, they would not have had time to withdraw from, and was
certain to succeed. And were we to examine all similar attempts, it
would be seen that there are few which might not have been effected in
the manner shown. But since most men are very ignorant of practical
affairs, they commit the gravest blunders, especially in matters which
lie, as this does, a little way out of the beaten track.

Wherefore, the contriver of a plot ought never, if he can help it, to
communicate his design until the moment when it is to be executed; or
if he must communicate it, then to some one man only, with whom he has
long been intimate, and whom he knows to be moved by the same feelings
as himself. To find one such person is far easier than to find several,
and, at the same time, involves less risk; for though this one man play
you false, you are not left altogether without resource, as you are
when your accomplices are numerous. For I have heard it shrewdly said
that to one man you may impart anything, since, unless you have been
led to commit yourself by writing, your denial will go as far as his
assertion. Shun writing, therefore, as you would a rock, for there is
nothing so damning as a letter under your own hand.

Plautianus, desiring to procure the deaths of the Emperor Severus and
his son Caracalla, intrusted the business to the tribune Saturninus,
who, being more disposed to betray than obey Plautianus, but at the
same time afraid that, if it came to laying a charge, Plautianus might
be believed sooner than he, asked him for a written authority, that his
commission might be credited. Blinded by ambition, Plautianus complied,
and forthwith was accused by Saturninus and found guilty; whereas, but
for that written warrant, together with other corroborating proofs, he
must have escaped by his bold denial of the charge. Against the
testimony of a single witness, you have thus some defence, unless
convicted by your own handwriting, or by other circumstantial proof
against which you must guard. A woman, named Epicharis, who had
formerly been a mistress of Nero, was privy to Piso’s conspiracy, and
thinking it might be useful to have the help of a certain captain of
triremes whom Nero had among his body-guards, she acquainted him with
the plot, but not with the names of the plotters. This fellow, turning
traitor, and accusing Epicharis to Nero, so stoutly did she deny the
charge, that Nero, confounded by her effrontery, let her go.

In imparting a plot to a single person there are, therefore, two risks:
one, that he may come forward of his own accord to accuse you; the
other, that if arrested on suspicion, or on some proof of his guilt, he
may, on being convicted, in the hope to escape punishment, betray you.
But in neither of these dangers are you left without a defence; since
you may meet the one by ascribing the charge to the malice of your
accuser, and the other by alleging that the witness his been forced by
torture to say what is untrue. The wisest course, however, is to impart
your design to none, but to act like those who have been mentioned
above; or if you impart it, then to one only: for although even in this
course there be a certain degree of danger, it is far less than when
many are admitted to your confidence.

A case nearly resembling that just now noticed, is where an emergency,
so urgent as to leave you no time to provide otherwise for your safety,
constrains you to do to a prince what you see him minded to do to you.
A necessity of this sort leads almost always to the end desired, as two
instances may suffice to show. Among the closest friends and intimates
of the Emperor Commodus, were two captains of the pretorian guards,
Letus and Electus, while among the most favoured of his distresses was
a certain Martia. But because these three often reproved him for his
manner of living, as disgraceful to himself and to his station, he
resolved to rid himself of them; and so wrote their names, along with
those of certain others whom he meant should be put to death the next
night, in a list which he placed under the pillow of his bed. But on
his going to bathe, a boy, who was a favourite of his, while playing
about his room and on his bed, found the list, and coming out of the
chamber with it in his hand, was met by Martia, who took it from him,
and on reading it and finding what it contained, sent for Letus and
Electus. And all three recognizing the danger in which they stood,
resolved to be beforehand with the tyrant, and losing no time, murdered
him that very night.

The Emperor Caracalla, being with his armies in Mesopotamia, had with
him Macrinus, who was more of a statesman than a soldier, as his
prefect. But because princes who are not themselves good are always
afraid lest others treat them as they deserve, Caracalla wrote to his
friend Maternianus in Rome to learn from the astrologers whether any
man had ambitious designs upon the empire, and to send him word.
Maternianus, accordingly, wrote back that such designs were entertained
by Macrinus. But this letter, ere it reached the emperor, fell into the
hands of Macrinus, who, seeing when he read it that he must either put
Caracalla to death before further letters arrived from Rome, or else
die himself, committed the business to a centurion, named Martialis,
whom he trusted, and whose brother had been slain by Caracalla a few
days before, who succeeded in killing the emperor.

We see, therefore, that an urgency which leaves no room for delay has
almost the same results as the method already noticed as followed by
Nelematus of Epirus. We see, too, what I remarked almost at the outset
of this Discourse, that the threats of princes expose them to greater
danger than the wrongs they actually inflict, and lead to more active
conspiracies: and, therefore, that a prince should be careful not to
threaten; since men are either to be treated kindly or else got rid of,
but never brought to such a pass that they have to choose between
slaying and being slain.

As to the dangers attending the execution of plots, these result either
from some change made in the plan, or from a failure in courage on the
part of him who is to carry it out; or else from some mistake he falls
into through want of foresight, or from his not giving the affair its
finishing stroke, as when some are left alive whom it was meant to put
to death. Now, nothing causes so much disturbance and hindrance in
human affairs, as to be forced, at a moment’s notice and without time
allowed for reflection, to vary your plan of action and adopt a
different one from that fixed on at the first. And if such changes
cause confusion anywhere, it is in matters appertaining to war, and in
enterprises of the kind we are now speaking of; for in such affairs as
these, there is nothing so essential as that men be prepared to do the
exact thing intrusted to them. But when men have for many days together
turned their whole thoughts to doing a thing in a certain way and in a
certain order, and the way and order are suddenly altered, it is
impossible but that they should be disconcerted and the whole scheme
ruined. For which reason, it is far better to do everything in
accordance with the preconcerted plan, though it be seen to be attended
with some disadvantages, than, in order to escape these, to involve
yourself in an infinity of dangers. And this will happen when you
depart from your original design without time given to form a new one.
For when time is given you may manage as you please.

The conspiracy of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici is
well known. The scheme agreed on was to give a banquet to the Cardinal
S. Giorgio, at which the brothers should be put to death. To each of
the conspirators a part was assigned: to one the murder, to another the
seizure of the palace, while a third was to ride through the streets
and call on the people to free themselves. But it so chanced that at a
time when the Pazzi, the Medici, and the Cardinal were all assembled in
the cathedral church of Florence to hear High Mass, it became known
that Giuliano would not be present at the banquet; whereupon the
conspirators, laying their heads together, resolved to do in church
what they were to have done elsewhere. This, however, deranged the
whole scheme. For Giovambattista of Montesecco, would have no hand in
the murder if it was to be done in a church; and the whole distribution
of parts had in consequence to be changed; when, as those to whom the
new parts were assigned had no time allowed them to nerve their minds
to their new tasks, they managed matters so badly that they were
overpowered in their attempt.

Courage fails a conspirator either from his own poorness of spirit, or
from his being overcome by some feeling of reverence. For such majesty
and awe attend the person of a prince, that it may well happen that he
softens or dismays his executioners. When Caius Marius was taken by the
people of Minturnum, the slave sent in to slay him, overawed by the
bearing of the man, and by the memories which his name called up,
became unnerved, and powerless to perform his office. And if this
influence was exercised by one who was a prisoner, and in chains, and
overwhelmed by adverse fortune, how much more must reverence be
inspired by a prince who is free and uncontrolled, surrounded by his
retinue and by all the pomp and splendour of his station; whose dignity
confounds, and whose graciousness conciliates.

Certain persons conspiring against Sitalces, king of Thrace, fixed a
day for his murder, and assembled at the place appointed, whither the
king had already come. Yet none of them raised a hand to harm him, and
all departed without attempting anything against him or knowing why
they refrained; each blaming the others. And more than once the same
folly was repeated, until the plot getting wind, they were taken and
punished for what they might have done, yet durst not do.

Two brothers of Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, conspired against him,
employing as their tool a certain priest named Giennes, a singing-man
in the service of the Duke. He, at their request, repeatedly brought
the Duke into their company, so that they had full opportunity to make
away with him. Yet neither of them ever ventured to strike the blow;
till at last, their scheme being discovered, they paid the penalty of
their combined cowardice and temerity. Such irresolution can only have
arisen from their being overawed by the majesty of the prince, or
touched by his graciousness.

In the execution of conspiracies, therefore, errors and mishaps arise
from a failure of prudence or courage to which all are subject, when,
losing self-control, they are led in their bewilderment to do and say
what they ought not. That men are thus confounded, and thrown off their
balance, could not be better shown than in the words of Titus Livius,
where he describes the behaviour of Alasamenes the Etolian, at the time
when he resolved on the death of Nabis the Spartan, of whom I have
spoken before. For when the time to act came, and he had disclosed to
his followers what they had to do, Livius represents him as
“_collecting his thoughts which had grown confused by dwelling on so
desperate an enterprise_.” For it is impossible for any one, though of
the most steadfast temper and used to the sight of death and to handle
deadly weapons, not to be perturbed at such a moment. For which reason
we should on such occasions choose for our tools those who have had
experience in similar affairs, and trust no others though reputed of
the truest courage. For in these grave undertakings, no one who is
without such experience, however bold and resolute, is to be trusted.

The confusion of which I speak may either cause you to drop your weapon
from your hand, or to use words which will have the same results.
Quintianus being commanded by Lucilla, sister of Commodus, to slay him,
lay in wait for him at the entrance of the amphitheatre, and rushing
upon him with a drawn dagger, cried out, “_The senate sends you this_;”
which words caused him to be seized before his blow descended. In like
manner Messer Antonio of Volterra, who as we have elsewhere seen was
told off to kill Lorenzo de’ Medici, exclaimed as he approached him,
“_Ah traitor!_” and this exclamation proved the salvation of Lorenzo
and the ruin of that conspiracy.

For the reasons now given, a conspiracy against a single ruler may
readily break down in its execution; but a conspiracy against two
rulers is not only difficult, but so hazardous that its success is
almost hopeless. For to effect like actions, at the same time, in
different places, is well-nigh impossible; nor can they be effected at
different times, if you would not have one counteract another. So that
if conspiracy against a single ruler be imprudent and dangerous, to
conspire against two, is in the last degree fool-hardy and desperate.
And were it not for the respect in which I hold the historian, I could
not credit as possible what Herodian relates of Plautianus, namely,
that he committed to the centurion Saturninus the task of slaying
single-handed both Severus and Caracalla, they dwelling in different
places; for the thing is so opposed to reason that on no other
authority could I be induced to accept it as true.

Certain young Athenians conspired against Diocles and Hippias, tyrants
of Athens. Diocles they slew; but Hippias, making his escape, avenged
him. Chion and Leonidas of Heraclea, disciples of Plato, conspired
against the despots Clearchus and Satirus. Clearchus fell, but Satirus
survived and avenged him. The Pazzi, of whom we have spoken so often,
succeeded in murdering Giuliano only. From such conspiracies,
therefore, as are directed against more heads than one, all should
abstain; for no good is to be got from them, whether for ourselves, for
our country, or for any one else. On the contrary, when those conspired
against escape, they become harsher and more unsufferable than before,
as, in the examples given, Florence, Athens, and Heraclea had cause to
know. True it is that the conspiracy contrived by Pelopidas for the
liberation of his country, had to encounter every conceivable
hindrance, and yet had the happiest end. For Pelopidas had to deal, not
with two tyrants only, but with ten; and so far from having their
confidence, could not, being an outlaw, even approach them. And yet he
succeeded in coming to Thebes, in putting the tyrants to death, and in
freeing his country. But whatever he did was done with the aid of one
of the counsellors of the tyrants, a certain Charon, through whom he
had all facilities for executing his design. Let none, however, take
this case as a pattern; for that it was in truth a desperate attempt,
and its success a marvel, was and is the opinion of all historians, who
speak of it as a thing altogether extraordinary and unexampled.

The execution of a plot may be frustrated by some groundless alarm or
unforeseen mischance occurring at the very moment when the scheme is to
be carried out. On the morning on which Brutus and his confederates
were to slay Cæsar, it so happened that Cæsar talked for a great while
with Cneus Pompilius Lenas, one of the conspirators; which some of the
others observing, were in terror that Pompilius was divulging the
conspiracy to Cæsar; whose life they would therefore have attempted
then and there, without waiting his arrival in the senate house, had
they not been reassured by seeing that when the conference ended he
showed no sign of unusual emotion. False alarms of this sort are to be
taken into account and allowed for, all the more that they are easily
raised. For he who has not a clear conscience is apt to assume that
others are speaking of him. A word used with a wholly different
purpose, may throw his mind off its balance and lead him to fancy that
reference is intended to the matter he is engaged on, and cause him
either to betray the conspiracy by flight, or to derange its execution
by anticipating the time fixed. And the more there are privy to the
conspiracy, the likelier is this to happen.

As to the mischances which may befall, since these are unforeseen, they
can only be instanced by examples which may make men more cautious.
Giulio Belanti of Siena, of whom I have spoken before, from the hate he
bore Pandolfo Petrucci, who had given him his daughter to wife and
afterwards taken her from him, resolved to murder him, and thus chose
his time. Almost every day Pandolfo went to visit a sick kinsman,
passing the house of Giulio on the way, who, remarking this, took
measures to have his accomplices ready in his house to kill Pandolfo as
he passed. Wherefore, placing the rest armed within the doorway, one he
stationed at a window to give the signal of Pandolfo’s approach. It so
happened however, that as he came nigh the house, and after the
look-out had given the signal, Pandolfo fell in with a friend who
stopped him to converse; when some of those with him, going on in
advance, saw and heard the gleam and clash of weapons, and so
discovered the ambuscade; whereby Pandolfo was saved, while Giulio with
his companions had to fly from Siena. This plot accordingly was marred,
and Giulio’s schemes baulked, in consequence of a chance meeting.
Against such accidents, since they are out of the common course of
things, no provision can be made. Still it is very necessary to take
into account all that may happen, and devise what remedies you can.

It now only remains for us to consider those dangers which follow after
the execution of a plot. These in fact resolve themselves into one,
namely, that some should survive who will avenge the death of the
murdered prince. The part of avenger is likely to be assumed by a son,
a brother, or other kinsman of the deceased, who in the ordinary course
of events might have looked to succeed to the princedom. And such
persons are suffered to live, either from inadvertence, or from some of
the causes noted already, as when Giovann’ Andrea of Lampognano, with
the help of his companions, put to death the Duke of Milan. For the son
and two brothers of the Duke, who survived him, were able to avenge his
death. In cases like this, indeed, the conspirators may be held
excused, since there is nothing they can do to help themselves. But
when from carelessness and want of due caution some one is allowed to
live whose death ought to have been secured, there is no excuse.
Certain conspirators, after murdering the lord, Count Girolamo of
Forli, made prisoners of his wife and of his children who were still
very young. By thinking they could not be safe unless they got
possession of the citadel, which the governor refused to surrender,
they obtained a promise from Madonna Caterina, for so the Countess was
named, that on their permitting her to enter the citadel she would
cause it to be given up to them, her children in the mean time
remaining with them as hostages. On which undertaking they suffered her
to enter the citadel. But no sooner had she got inside than she fell to
upbraid them from the walls with the murder of her husband, and to
threaten them with every kind of vengeance; and to show them how little
store she set upon her children, told them scoffingly that she knew how
others could be got. In the end, the rebels having no leader to advise
them, and perceiving too late the error into which they had been
betrayed, had to pay the penalty of their rashness by perpetual
banishment.

But of all the dangers which may follow on the execution of a plot,
none is so much or so justly to be feared as that the people should be
well affected to the prince whom you have put to death. For against
this danger conspirators have no resource which can ensure their
safety. Of this we have example in the case of Cæsar, who as he had the
love of the Roman people was by them avenged; for they it was who, by
driving out the conspirators from Rome, were the cause that all of
them, at different times and in different places, came to violent ends.

Conspiracies against their country are less danger for those who take
part in them than conspiracies against princes; since there is less
risk beforehand, and though there be the same danger in their
execution, there is none afterwards. Beforehand, the risks are few,
because a citizen may use means for obtaining power without betraying
his wishes or designs to any; and unless his course be arrested, his
designs are likely enough to succeed; nay, though laws be passed to
restrain him, he may strike out a new path. This is to be understood of
a commonwealth which has to some degree become corrupted; for in one
wherein there is no taint of corruption, there being no soil in which
evil seed can grow, such designs will never suggest themselves to any
citizen.

In a commonwealth, therefore, a citizen may by many means and in many
ways aspire to the princedom without risking destruction, both because
republics are slower than princes are to take alarm, are less
suspicious and consequently less cautious, and because they look with
greater reverence upon their great citizens, who are in this way
rendered bolder and more reckless in attacking them. Any one who has
read Sallust’s account of the conspiracy of Catiline, must remember
how, when that conspiracy was discovered, Catiline not only remained in
Rome, but even made his appearance in the senatehouse, where he was
suffered to address the senate in the most insulting terms,—so
scrupulous was that city in protecting the liberty of all its citizens.
Nay, even after he had left Rome and placed himself at the head of his
army, Lentulus and his other accomplices would not have been
imprisoned, had not letters been found upon them clearly establishing
their guilt. Hanno, the foremost citizen of Carthage, aspiring to
absolute power, on the occasion of the marriage of a daughter contrived
a plot for administering poison to the whole senate and so making
himself prince. The scheme being discovered, the senate took no steps
against him beyond passing a law to limit the expense of banquets and
marriage ceremonies. So great was the respect they paid to his quality.

True, the _execution_ of a plot against your country is attended with
greater difficulty and danger, since it seldom happens that, in
conspiring against so many, your own resources are sufficient by
themselves; for it is not every one who, like Cæsar, Agathocles, or
Cleomenes, is at the head of an army, so as to be able at a stroke, and
by open force to make himself master of his country. To such as these,
doubtless, the path is safe and easy enough; but others who have not
such an assembled force ready at their command, must effect their ends
either by stratagem and fraud, or with the help of foreign troops. Of
such stratagems and frauds we have an instance in the case of
Pisistratus the Athenian, who after defeating the Megarians and thereby
gaining the favour of his fellow-citizens, showed himself to them one
morning covered with wounds and blood, declaring that he had been thus
outraged through the jealousy of the nobles, and asking that he might
have an armed guard assigned for his protection. With the authority
which this lent him, he easily rose to such a pitch of power as to
become tyrant of Athens. In like manner Pandolfo Petrucci, on his
return with the other exiles to Siena, was appointed the command of the
public guard, as a mere office of routine which others had declined.
Very soon, however, this armed force gave him so much importance that
he became the supreme ruler of the State. And many others have followed
other plans and methods, and in the course of time, and without
incurring danger, have achieved their aim.

Conspirators against their country, whether trusting to their own
forces or to foreign aid, have had more or less success in proportion
as they have been favoured by Fortune. Catiline, of whom we spoke just
now, was overthrown. Hanno, who has also been mentioned, failing to
accomplish his object by poison, armed his partisans to the number of
many thousands; but both he and they came to an ill end. On the other
hand, certain citizens of Thebes conspiring to become its tyrants,
summoned a Spartan army to their assistance, and usurped the absolute
control of the city. In short, if we examine all the conspiracies which
men have engaged in against their country, we shall find that few or
none have been quelled in their inception, but that all have either
succeeded, or have broken down in their execution. Once executed, they
entail no further risks beyond those implied in the nature of a
princedom. For the man who becomes a tyrant incurs all the natural and
ordinary dangers in which a tyranny involves him, and has no remedies
against them save those of which I have already spoken.

This is all that occurs to me to say on the subject of conspiracies. If
I have noticed those which have been carried out with the sword rather
than those wherein poison has been the instrument, it is because,
generally speaking, the method of proceeding is the same in both. It is
true, nevertheless, that conspiracies which are to be carried out by
poison are, by reason of their uncertainty, attended by greater danger.
For since fewer opportunities offer for their execution, you must have
an understanding with persons who can command opportunities. But it is
dangerous to have to depend on others. Again, many causes may hinder a
poisoned draught from proving mortal; as when the murderers of
Commodus, on his vomiting the poison given him, had to strangle him.

Princes, then, have no worse enemy than conspiracy, for when a
conspiracy is formed against them, it either carries them off, or
discredits them: since, if it succeeds, they die; while, if it be
discovered, and the conspirators be put to death themselves, it will
always be believed that the whole affair has been trumped up by the
prince that he might glut his greed and cruelty with the goods and
blood of those whom he has made away with. Let me not, however, forget
to warn the prince or commonwealth against whom a conspiracy is
directed, that on getting word of it, and before taking any steps to
punish it, they endeavour, as far as they can, to ascertain its
character, and after carefully weighing the strength of the
conspirators with their own, on finding it preponderate, never suffer
their knowledge of the plot to appear until they are ready with a force
sufficient to crush it. For otherwise, to disclose their knowledge will
only give the signal for their destruction. They must strive therefore
to seem unconscious of what is going on; for conspirators who see
themselves detected are driven forward by necessity and will stick at
nothing. Of this precaution we have an example in Roman history, when
the officers of the two legions, who, as has already been mentioned,
were left behind to defend the Capuans from the Samnites, conspired
together against the Capuans. For on rumours of this conspiracy
reaching Rome, Rutilius the new consul was charged to see to it; who,
not to excite the suspicions of the conspirators, publicly gave out
that by order of the senate the Capuan legions were continued in their
station. The conspirators believing this, and thinking they would have
ample time to execute their plans, made no effort to hasten matters,
but remained at their ease, until they found that the consul was moving
one of the two legions to a distance from the other. This arousing
their suspicion, led them to disclose their designs and endeavour to
carry them out.

Now, we could have no more instructive example than this in whatever
way we look at it. For it shows how slow men are to move in those
matters wherein time seems of little importance, and how active they
become when necessity urges them. Nor can a prince or commonwealth
desiring for their own ends to retard the execution of a conspiracy,
use any more effectual means to do so, than by artfully holding out to
the conspirators some special opportunity as likely soon to present
itself; awaiting which, and believing they have time and to spare for
what they have to do, they will afford that prince or commonwealth all
the leisure needed to prepare for their punishment. Whosoever neglects
these precautions hastens his own destruction, as happened with the
Duke of Athens, and with Guglielmo de’ Pazzi. For the Duke, who had
made himself tyrant of Florence, on learning that he was being
conspired against, without further inquiry into the matter, caused one
of the conspirators to be seized; whereupon the rest at once armed
themselves and deprived him of his government. Guglielmo, again, being
commissary in the Val di Chiana in the year 1501, and learning that a
conspiracy was being hatched in Arezzo to take the town from the
Florentines and give it over to the Vitelli, repaired thither with all
haste; and without providing himself with the necessary forces or
giving a thought to the strength of the conspirators, on the advice of
the bishop, his son, had one of them arrested. Which becoming known to
the others, they forthwith rushed to arms, and taking the town from the
Florentines, made Guglielmo their prisoner. Where, however,
conspiracies are weak, they may and should be put down without scruple
or hesitation.

Two methods, somewhat opposed to one another, which have occasionally
been followed in dealing with conspiracies, are in no way to be
commended. One of these was that adopted by the Duke of Athens, of whom
I have just now spoken, who to have it thought that he confided in the
goodwill of the Florentines, caused a certain man who gave information
of a plot against him, to be put to death. The other was that followed
by Dion the Syracusan, who, to sound the intentions of one whom he
suspected, arranged with Calippus, whom he trusted, to pretend to get
up a conspiracy against him. Neither of these tyrants reaped any
advantage from the course he followed. For the one discouraged
informers and gave heart to those who were disposed to conspire, the
other prepared an easy road to his own death, or rather was prime mover
in a conspiracy against himself. As the event showed. For Calippus
having free leave to plot against Dion, plotted to such effect, that he
deprived him at once of his State and life.




CHAPTER VII.—_Why it is that changes from Freedom to Servitude, and
from Servitude to Freedom, are sometimes made without Bloodshed, but at
other times reek with Blood_.


Since we find from history that in the countless changes which have
been made from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom,
sometimes an infinite multitude have perished, while at others not a
soul has suffered (as when Rome made her change from kings to consuls,
on which occasion none was banished save Tarquin, and no harm was done
to any other), it may perhaps be asked, how it happens that of these
revolutions, some have been attended by bloodshed and others not.

The answer I take to be this. The government which suffers change
either has or has not had its beginning in violence. And since the
government which has its beginning in violence must start by inflicting
injuries on many, it must needs happen that on its downfall those who
were injured will desire to avenge themselves; from which desire for
vengeance the slaughter and death of many will result. But when a
government originates with, and derives its authority from the whole
community, there is no reason why the community, if it withdraw that
authority, should seek to injure any except the prince from whom it
withdraws it. Now the government of Rome was of this nature, and the
expulsion of the Tarquins took place in this way. Of a like character
was the government of the Medici in Florence, and, accordingly, upon
their overthrow in the year 1494, no injury was done to any save
themselves.

In such cases, therefore, the changes I speak of do not occasion any
very great danger. But the changes wrought by men who have wrongs to
revenge, are always of a most dangerous kind, and such, to say the
least, as may well cause dismay in the minds of those who read of them.
But since history abounds with instances of such changes I need say no
more about them.




CHAPTER VIII.—_That he who would effect Changes in a Commonwealth, must
give heed to its Character and Condition_


I have said before that a bad citizen cannot work grave mischief in a
commonwealth which has not become corrupted. This opinion is not only
supported by the arguments already advanced, but is further confirmed
by the examples of Spurius Cassius and Manlius Capitolinus. For
Spurius, being ambitious, and desiring to obtain extraordinary
authority in Rome, and to win over the people by loading them with
benefits (as, for instance, by selling them those lands which the
Romans had taken from the Hernici,) his designs were seen through by
the senate, and laid him under such suspicion, that when in haranguing
the people he offered them the money realized by the sale of the grain
brought from Sicily at the public expense, they would have none of it,
believing that he offered it as the price of their freedom. Now, had
the people been corrupted, they would not have refused this bribe, but
would have opened rather than closed the way to the tyranny.

The example of Manlius is still more striking. For in his case we see
what excellent gifts both of mind and body, and what splendid services
to his country were afterwards cancelled by that shameful eagerness to
reign which we find bred in him by his jealousy of the honours paid
Camillus. For so darkened did his mind become, that without reflecting
what were the institutions to which Rome was accustomed, or testing the
material he had to work on, when he would have seen that it was still
unfit to be moulded to evil ends, he set himself to stir up tumults
against the senate and against the laws of his country.

And herein we recognize the excellence of this city of Rome, and of the
materials whereof it was composed. For although the nobles were wont to
stand up stoutly for one another, not one of them stirred to succour
Manlius, and not one of his kinsfolk made any effort on his behalf, so
that although it was customary, in the case of other accused persons,
for their friends to put on black and sordid raiment, with all the
other outward signs of grief, in order to excite pity for the accused,
none was seen to do any of these things for Manlius. Even the tribunes
of the people, though constantly ready to promote whatever courses
seemed to favour the popular cause, and the more vehemently the more
they seemed to make against the nobles, in this instance sided with the
nobles to put down the common enemy. Nay the very people themselves,
keenly alive to their own interests, and well disposed towards any
attempt to damage the nobles, though they showed Manlius many proofs of
their regard, nevertheless, when he was cited by the tribunes to appear
before them and submit his cause for their decision, assumed the part
of judges and not of defenders, and without scruple or hesitation
sentenced him to die. Wherefore, I think, that there is no example in
the whole Roman history which serves so well as this to demonstrate the
virtues of all ranks in that republic. For not a man in the whole city
bestirred himself to shield a citizen endowed with every great quality,
and who, both publicly and privately, had done so much that deserved
praise. But in all, the love of country outweighed every other thought,
and all looked less to his past deserts than to the dangers which his
present conduct threatened; from which to relieve themselves they put
him to death. “_Such_,” says Livius, “_was the fate of a man worthy our
admiration had he not been born in a free State_.”

And here two points should be noted. The first, that glory is to be
sought by different methods in a corrupt city, and in one which still
preserves its freedom. The second, which hardly differs from the first,
that in their actions, and especially in matters of moment, men must
have regard to times and circumstances and adapt themselves thereto.
For those persons who from an unwise choice, or from natural
inclination, run counter to the times will for the most part live
unhappily, and find all they undertake issue in failure; whereas those
who accommodate themselves to the times are fortunate and successful.
And from the passage cited we may plainly infer, that had Manlius lived
in the days of Marius and Sylla, when the body of the State had become
corrupted, so that he could have impressed it with the stamp of his
ambition, he might have had the same success as they had, and as those
others had who after them aspired to absolute power; and, conversely,
that if Sylla and Marius had lived in the days of Manlius, they must
have broken down at the very beginning of their attempts.

For one man, by mischievous arts and measures, may easily prepare the
ground for the universal corruption of a city; but no one man in his
lifetime can carry that corruption so far, as himself to reap the
harvest; or granting that one man’s life might be long enough for this
purpose, it would be impossible for him, having regard to the ordinary
habits of men, who grow impatient and cannot long forego the
gratification of their desires, to wait until the corruption was
complete. Moreover, men deceive themselves in respect of their own
affairs, and most of all in respect of those on which they are most
bent; so that either from impatience or from self-deception, they rush
upon undertakings for which the time is not ripe, and so come to an ill
end. Wherefore to obtain absolute authority in a commonwealth and to
destroy its liberties, you must find the body of the State already
corrupted, and corrupted by a gradual wasting continued from generation
to generation; which, indeed, takes place necessarily, unless, as has
been already explained, the State be often reinforced by good examples,
or brought back to its first beginnings by wise laws.

Manlius, therefore, would have been a rare and renowned man had he been
born in a corrupt city; and from his example we see that citizens
seeking to introduce changes in the form of their government, whether
in favour of liberty or despotism, ought to consider what materials
they have to deal with, and then judge of the difficulty of their task.
For it is no less arduous and dangerous to attempt to free a people
disposed to live in servitude, than to enslave a people who desire to
live free.

And because it has been said above, that in their actions men must take
into account the character of the times in which they live, and guide
themselves accordingly, I shall treat this point more fully in the
following Chapter.




CHAPTER IX.—_That to enjoy constant good Fortune we must change with
the Times._


I have repeatedly noted that the good or bad fortune of men depends on
whether their methods of acting accord with the character of the times.
For we see that in what they do some men act impulsively, others warily
and with caution. And because, from inability to preserve the just
mean, they in both of these ways overstep the true limit, they commit
mistakes in one direction or the other. He, however, will make fewest
mistakes, and may expect to prosper most, who, while following the
course to which nature inclines him, finds, as I have said, his method
of acting in accordance with the times in which he lives.

All know that in his command of the Roman armies, Fabius Maximus
displayed a prudence and caution very different from the audacity and
hardihood natural to his countrymen; and it was his good fortune that
his methods suited with the times. For Hannibal coming into Italy in
all the flush of youth and recent success, having already by two
defeats stripped Rome of her best soldiers and filled her with dismay,
nothing could have been more fortunate for that republic than to find a
general able, by his deliberateness and caution, to keep the enemy at
bay. Nor, on the other hand, could Fabius have fallen upon times better
suited to the methods which he used, and by which he crowned himself
with glory. That he acted in accordance with his natural bent, and not
from a reasoned choice, we may gather from this, that when Scipio, to
bring the war to an end, proposed to pass with his army into Africa,
Fabius, unable to depart from his characteristic methods and habits,
strenuously opposed him; so that had it rested with him, Hannibal might
never have left Italy. For he perceived not that the times had changed,
and that with them it was necessary to change the methods of
prosecuting the war. Had Fabius, therefore, been King of Rome, he might
well have caused the war to end unhappily, not knowing how to
accommodate his methods to the change in the times. As it was, he lived
in a commonwealth in which there were many citizens, and many different
dispositions; and which as it produced a Fabius, excellent at a time
when it was necessary to protract hostilities, so also, afterwards gave
birth to a Scipio, at a time suited to bring them to a successful
close.

And hence it comes that a commonwealth endures longer, and has a more
sustained good fortune than a princedom, because from the diversity in
the characters of its citizens, it can adapt itself better than a
prince can to the diversity of times. For, as I have said before, a man
accustomed to follow one method, will never alter it; whence it must
needs happen that when times change so as no longer to accord with his
method, he will be ruined. Piero Soderini, of whom I have already
spoken, was guided in all his actions by patience and gentleness, and
he and his country prospered while the times were in harmony with these
methods. But, afterwards, when a time came when it behoved him to have
done with patience and gentleness, he knew not how to drop them, and
was ruined together with his country. Pope Julius II., throughout the
whole of his pontificate, was governed by impulse and passion, and
because the times were in perfect accord, all his undertakings
prospered. But had other times come requiring other qualities, he could
not have escaped destruction, since he could not have changed his
methods nor his habitual line of conduct.

As to why such changes are impossible, two reasons may be given. One is
that we cannot act in opposition to the bent of our nature. The other,
that when a man has been very successful while following a particular
method, he can never be convinced that it is for his advantage to try
some other. And hence it results that a man’s fortunes vary, because
times change and he does not change with them. So, too, with
commonwealths, which, as we have already shown at length, are ruined
from not altering their institutions to suit the times. And
commonwealths are slower to change than princes are, changes costing
them more effort; because occasions must be waited for which shall stir
the whole community, and it is not enough that a single citizen alters
his method of acting.

But since I have made mention of Fabius Maximus who wore out Hannibal
by keeping him at bay, I think it opportune to consider in the
following Chapter whether a general who desires to engage his enemy at
all risks, can be prevented by that enemy from doing so.




CHAPTER X.—_That a Captain cannot escape Battle when his Enemy forces
it on him at all risks._


“_Cneius Sulpitius when appointed dictator against the Gauls, being
unwilling to tempt Fortune by attacking an enemy whom delay and a
disadvantageous position would every day render weaker, protracted the
war._”

When a mistake is made of a sort that all or most men are likely to
fall into, I think it not amiss to mark it again and again with
disapproval. Wherefore, although I have already shown repeatedly how in
affairs of moment the actions of the moderns conform not to those of
antiquity, still it seems to me not superfluous, in this place, to say
the same thing once more. For if in any particular the moderns have
deviated from the methods of the ancients, it is especially in their
methods of warfare, wherein not one of those rules formerly so much
esteemed is now attended to. And this because both princes and
commonwealths have devolved the charge of such matters upon others,
and, to escape danger, have kept aloof from all military service; so
that although one or another of the princes of our times may
occasionally be seen present in person with his army, we are not
therefore to expect from him any further praiseworthy behaviour. For
even where such personages take part in any warlike enterprise, they do
so out of ostentation and from no nobler motive; though doubtless from
sometimes seeing their soldiers face to face, and from retaining to
themselves the title of command, they are likely to make fewer blunders
than we find made by republics, and most of all by the republics of
Italy, which though altogether dependent upon others, and themselves
utterly ignorant of everything relating to warfare, do yet, that they
may figure as the commanders of their armies, take upon them to direct
their movements, and in doing so commit countless mistakes; some of
which have been considered elsewhere but one is of such importance as
to deserve notice here.

When these sluggard princes or effeminate republics send forth any of
their Captains, it seems to them that the wisest instruction they can
give him is to charge him on no account to give battle, but, on the
contrary, to do what he can to avoid fighting. Wherein they imagine
themselves to imitate the prudence of Fabius Maximus, who by
protracting the war with Hannibal, saved the Roman commonwealth; not
perceiving that in most instances such advice to a captain is either
useless or hurtful. For the truth of the matter is, that a captain who
would keep the field, cannot decline battle when his adversary forces
it on him at all hazards. So that the instruction to avoid battle is
but tantamount to saying, “You shall engage when it pleases your enemy,
and not when it suits yourself.” For if you would keep the field and
yet avoid battle, the only safe course is to interpose a distance of at
least fifty miles between you and your enemy, and afterwards to
maintain so vigilant a look-out, that should he advance you will have
time to make your retreat. Another method is to shut yourself up in
some town. But both of these methods are extremely disadvantageous. For
by following the former, you leave your country a prey to the enemy,
and a valiant prince would far sooner risk the chances of battle than
prolong a war in a manner so disastrous to his subjects; while by
adopting the latter method, and shutting yourself up in a town with
your army, there is manifest danger of your being besieged, and
presently reduced by famine and forced to surrender. Wherefore it is
most mischievous to seek to avoid battle in either of these two ways.

To intrench yourself in a strong position, as Fabius was wont to do, is
a good method when your army is so formidable that the enemy dare not
advance to attack you in your intrenchments; yet it cannot truly be
said that Fabius avoided battle, but rather that he sought to give
battle where he could do so with advantage. For had Hannibal desired to
fight, Fabius would have waited for him and fought him. But Hannibal
never dared to engage him on his own ground. So that an engagement was
avoided as much by Hannibal as by Fabius, since if either had been
minded to fight at all hazards the other would have been constrained to
take one of three courses, that is to say, one or other of the two just
now mentioned, or else to retreat. The truth of this is confirmed by
numberless examples, and more particularly by what happened in the war
waged by the Romans against Philip of Macedon, the father of Perseus.
For Philip being invaded by the Romans, resolved not to give them
battle; and to avoid battle, sought at first to do as Fabius had done
in Italy, posting himself on the summit of a hill, where he intrenched
himself strongly, thinking that the Romans would not venture to attack
him there. But they advancing and attacking him in his intrenchments,
drove him from his position; when, unable to make further resistance,
he fled with the greater part of his army, and was only saved from
utter destruction by the difficulty of the ground, which made it
impossible for the Romans to pursue him.

Philip, therefore, who had no mind to fight, encamping too near the
Romans, was forced to fly; and learning from this experience that to
escape fighting it was not enough for him to intrench himself on a
hill, yet not choosing to shut himself up in a walled town, he was
constrained to take the other alternative of keeping at a distance of
many miles from the Roman legions. Accordingly, when the Romans entered
one province, he betook himself to another, and when they left a
province he entered it. But perceiving that by protracting the war in
this way, his condition grew constantly worse, while his subjects
suffered grievously, now from his own troops, at another time from
those of the enemy, he at last resolved to hazard battle, and so came
to a regular engagement with the Romans.

It is for your interest, therefore, not to fight, when you possess the
same advantages as Fabius, or as Cneius Sulpitius had; in other words,
when your army is so formidable in itself that the enemy dare not
attack you in your intrenchments, and although he has got within your
territory has yet gained no footing there, and suffers in consequence
from the want of necessary supplies. In such circumstances delay is
useful, for the reasons assigned by Titus Livius when speaking of
Sulpitius. In no other circumstances, however, can an engagement be
avoided without dishonour or danger. For to retire as Philip did, is
nothing else than defeat; and the disgrace is greater in proportion as
your valour has been less put to the proof. And if Philip was lucky
enough to escape, another, not similarly favoured by the nature of the
ground, might not have the same good fortune.

That Hannibal was not a master in the arts of warfare there is none
will venture to maintain. Wherefore, when he had to encounter Scipio in
Africa, it may be assumed that had he seen any advantage in prolonging
the war he would have done so; and, possibly, being a skilful captain
and in command of a valiant army, he might have been able to do what
Fabius did in Italy. But since he took not that course, we may infer
that he was moved by sufficient reasons. For the captain who has got an
army together, and perceives that from want of money or friends he
cannot maintain it long, must be a mere madman if he do not at once,
and before his army melts away, try the fortunes of battle; since he is
certain to lose by delay, while by fighting he may chance to succeed.
And there is this also to be kept in view, that we must strive, even if
we be defeated, to gain glory; and that more glory is to be won in
being beaten by force, than in a defeat from any other cause. And this
we may suppose to have weighed with Hannibal. On the other hand,
supposing Hannibal to have declined battle, Scipio, even if he had
lacked courage to follow him up and attack him in his intrenched camp,
would not have suffered thereby; for as he had defeated Syphax, and got
possession of many of the African towns, he could have rested where he
was in the same security and with the same convenience as if he had
been in Italy. But this was not the case with Hannibal when he had to
encounter Fabius, nor with the Gauls when they were opposed to
Sulpitius.

Least of all can he decline battle who invades with his army the
country of another; for seeking to enter his enemy’s country, he must
fight whenever the enemy comes forward to meet him; and is under still
greater necessity to fight, if he undertake the siege of any town. As
happened in our own day with Duke Charles of Burgundy, who, when
beleaguering Morat, a town of the Swiss, was by them attacked and
routed; or as happened with the French army encamped against Novara,
which was in like manner defeated by the Swiss.




CHAPTER XI.—_That one who has to contend with many, though he be weaker
than they, will prevail if he can withstand their first onset._


The power exercised in Rome by the tribunes of the people was great,
and, as I have repeatedly explained, was necessary, since otherwise
there would have been no check on the ambition of the nobles, and the
commonwealth must have grown corrupted far sooner than it did. But
because, as I have said elsewhere, there is in everything a latent evil
peculiar to it, giving rise to new mischances, it becomes necessary to
provide against these by new ordinances. The authority of the tribunes,
therefore, being insolently asserted so as to become formidable to the
nobility and to the entire city, disorders dangerous to the liberty of
the State must thence have resulted, had not a method been devised by
Appius Claudius for controlling the ambition of the tribunes. This was,
to secure that there should always be one of their number timid, or
venal, or else a lover of the general good, who could be influenced to
oppose the rest whenever these sought to pass any measure contrary to
the wishes of the senate. This remedy was a great restraint on the
excessive authority of the tribunes, and on many occasions proved
serviceable to Rome.

I am led by this circumstance to remark, that when many powerful
persons are united against one, who, although no match for the others
collectively, is also powerful, the chances are more in favour of this
single and less I powerful person, than of the many who together are
much stronger. For setting aside an infinity of accidents which can be
turned to better account by one than by many, it will always happen
that, by exercising a little dexterity, the one will be able to divide
the many, and weaken the force which was strong while it was united. In
proof whereof, I shall not refer to ancient examples, though many such
might be cited, but content myself with certain modern instances taken
from the events of our own times.

In the year 1484, all Italy combined against the Venetians, who finding
their position desperate, and being unable to keep their army any
longer in the field, bribed Signer Lodovico, who then governed Milan,
and so succeeded in effecting a settlement, whereby they not only
recovered the towns they had lost, but also obtained for themselves a
part of the territories of Ferrara; so that those were by peace the
gainers, who in war had been the losers. Not many years ago the whole
world was banded together against France; but before the war came to a
close, Spain breaking with the confederates and entering into a
separate treaty with France, the other members of the league also, were
presently forced to make terms.

Wherefore we may always assume when we see a war set on foot by many
against one, that this one, if he have strength to withstand the first
shock, and can temporize and wait his opportunity, is certain to
prevail. But unless he can do this he runs a thousand dangers: as did
the Venetians in the year 1508, who, could they have temporized with
the French, and so got time to conciliate some of those who had
combined against them, might have escaped the ruin which then overtook
them. But not possessing such a strong army as would have enabled them
to temporize with their enemies, and consequently not having the time
needed for gaining any to their side, they were undone. Yet we know
that the Pope, as soon as he had obtained what he wanted, made friends
with them, and that Spain did the like; and that both the one and the
other of these powers would gladly have saved the Lombard territory for
themselves, nor would, if they could have helped it, have left it to
France, so as to augment her influence in Italy.

The Venetians, therefore, should have given up a part to save the rest;
and had they done so at a time when the surrender would not have seemed
to be made under compulsion, and before any step had been taken in the
direction of war, it would have been a most prudent course; although
discreditable and probably of little avail after war had been begun.
But until the war broke out, few of the Venetian citizens recognized
the danger, fewer still the remedy, and none ventured to prescribe it.

But to return to the point whence we started, I say that the same
safeguard for their country which the Roman senate found against the
ambition of the tribunes in their number, is within the reach of the
prince who is attacked by many adversaries, if he only know to use
prudently those methods which promote division.




CHAPTER XII.—_A prudent Captain will do what he can to make it
necessary for his own Soldiers to fight, and to relieve his Enemy from
that necessity._


Elsewhere I have noted how greatly men are governed in what they do by
Necessity, and how much of their renown is due to her guidance, so that
it has even been said by some philosophers, that the hands and tongues
of men, the two noblest instruments of their fame, would never have
worked to perfection, nor have brought their labours to that pitch of
excellence we see them to have reached, had they not been impelled by
this cause. The captains of antiquity, therefore, knowing the virtues
of this necessity, and seeing the steadfast courage which it gave their
soldiers in battle, spared no effort to bring their armies under its
influence, while using all their address to loosen its hold upon their
enemies. For which reason, they would often leave open to an adversary
some way which they might have closed, and close against their own men
some way they might have left open.

Whosoever, therefore, would have a city defend itself stubbornly, or an
army fight resolutely in the field, must before all things endeavour to
impress the minds of those whom he commands with the belief that no
other course is open to them. In like manner a prudent captain who
undertakes the attack of a city, will measure the ease or difficulty of
his enterprise, by knowing and considering the nature of the necessity
which compels the inhabitants to defend it; and where he finds that
necessity to be strong, he may infer that his task will be difficult,
but if otherwise, that it will be easy.

And hence it happens that cities are harder to be recovered after a
revolt than to be taken for the first time. Because on a first attack,
having no occasion to fear punishment, since they have given no ground
of offence, they readily surrender; but when they have revolted, they
know that they have given ground of offence, and, fearing punishment,
are not so easily brought under. A like stubbornness grows from the
natural hostility with which princes or republics who are neighbours
regard one another; which again is caused by the desire to dominate
over those who live near, or from jealousy of their power. This is more
particularly the case with republics, as in Tuscany for example; for
contention and rivalry have always made, and always will make it
extremely hard for one republic to bring another into subjection. And
for this reason any one who considers attentively who are the
neighbours of Florence, and who of Venice, will not marvel so much as
some have done, that Florence should have spent more than Venice on her
wars and gained less; since this results entirely from the Venetians
finding their neighbouring towns less obstinate in their resistance
than the Florentines theirs. For all the towns in the neighbourhood of
Venice have been used to live under princes and not in freedom; and
those who are used to servitude commonly think little of changing
masters, nay are often eager for the change. In this way Venice, though
she has had more powerful neighbours than Florence, has been able, from
finding their towns less stubborn, to subdue them more easily than the
latter, surrounded exclusively by free cities, has had it in her power
to do.

But, to return to the matter in hand, the captain who attacks a town
should use what care he can, not to drive the defenders to extremities,
lest he render them stubborn; but when they fear punishment should
promise them pardon, and when they fear for their freedom should assure
them that he has no designs against the common welfare, but only
against a few ambitious men in their city; for such assurances have
often smoothed the way to the surrender of towns. And although pretexts
of this sort are easily seen through, especially by the wise, the mass
of the people are often beguiled by them, because desiring present
tranquillity, they shut their eyes to the snares hidden behind these
specious promises. By means such as these, therefore, cities
innumerable have been brought into subjection, as recently was the case
with Florence. The ruin of Crassus and his army was similarly caused:
for although he himself saw through the empty promises of the
Parthians, as meant only to blind the Roman soldiers to the necessity
of defending themselves, yet he could not keep his men steadfast, they,
as we clearly gather in reading the life of this captain, being
deceived by the offers of peace held out to them by their enemies.

On the other hand, when the Samnites, who, at the instance of a few
ambitious men, and in violation of the terms of the truce made with
them, had overrun and pillaged lands belonging to the allies of Rome,
afterwards sent envoys to Rome to implore peace, offering to restore
whatever they had taken, and to surrender the authors of these injuries
and outrages as prisoners, and these offers were rejected by the
Romans, and the envoys returned to Samnium bringing with them no hope
of an adjustment, Claudius Pontius, who then commanded the army of the
Samnites, showed them in a remarkable speech, that the Romans desired
war at all hazards, and declared that, although for the sake of his
country he wished for peace, necessity constrained him to prepare for
war; telling them “_that was a just war which could not be escaped, and
those arms sacred in which lay their only hopes._” And building on this
necessity, he raised in the minds of his soldiers a confident
expectation of success. That I may not have to revert to this matter
again, it will be convenient to notice here those examples from Roman
history which most merit attention. When Caius Manilius was in command
of the legions encamped against Veii, a division of the Veientine army
having got within the Roman intrenchments, Manilius ran forward with a
company of his men to defend them, and, to prevent the escape of the
Veientines, guarded all the approaches to the camp. The Veientines
finding themselves thus shut in, began to fight with such fury that
they slew Manilius, and would have destroyed all the rest of the Roman
army, had not the prudence of one of the tribunes opened a way for the
Veientines to retreat. Here we see that so long as necessity compelled,
the Veientines fought most fiercely, but on finding a path opened for
escape, preferred flight to combat. On another occasion when the
Volscians and Equians passed with their armies across the Roman
frontier, the consuls were sent out to oppose them, and an engagement
ensued. It so happened that when the combat was at its height, the army
of the Volscians, commanded by Vectius Mescius, suddenly found
themselves shut in between their own camp, which a division of the
Romans had occupied, and the body of the Roman army; when seeing that
they must either perish or cut a way for themselves with their swords,
Vectius said to them, “_Come on, my men, here is no wall or rampart to
be scaled: we fight man with man; in valour we are their equals, and
necessity, that last and mightiest weapon, gives us the advantage._”
Here, then, necessity is spoken of by Titus Livius as _the last and
mightiest weapon_.

Camillus, the wisest and most prudent of all the Roman commanders, when
he had got within the town of Veii with his army, to make its surrender
easier and not to drive its inhabitants to desperation, called out to
his men, so that the Veientines might hear, to spare all whom they
found unarmed. Whereupon the defenders throwing away their weapons, the
town was taken almost without bloodshed. And this device was afterwards
followed by many other captains.




CHAPTER XIII.—_Whether we may trust more to a valiant Captain with a
weak Army, or to a valiant Army with a weak Captain._


Coriolanus being banished from Rome betook himself to the Volscians,
and when he had got together an army wherewith to avenge himself on his
countrymen, came back to Rome; yet, again withdrew, not constrained to
retire by the might of the Roman arms, but out of reverence for his
mother. From this incident, says Titus Livius, we may learn that the
spread of the Roman power was due more to the valour of her captains
than of her soldiers. For before this the Volscians had always been
routed, and only grew successful when Coriolanus became their captain.

But though Livius be of this opinion, there are many passages in his
history to show that the Roman soldiers, even when left without
leaders, often performed astonishing feats of valour, nay, sometimes
maintained better discipline and fought with greater spirit after their
consuls were slain than they had before. For example, the army under
the Scipios in Spain, after its two leaders had fallen, was able by its
valour not merely to secure its own safety, but to overcome the enemy
and preserve the province for the Roman Republic. So that to state the
case fairly, we find many instances in which the valour of the soldiers
alone gained the day, as well as many in which success was wholly due
to the excellence of the captain. From which it may be inferred that
the one stands in need of the other.

And here the question suggests itself: which is the more formidable, a
good army badly led, or a good captain commanding an indifferent army;
though, were we to adopt the opinion of Cæsar on this head, we ought
lightly to esteem both. For when Cæsar went to Spain against Afranius
and Petreius, who were there in command of a strong army, he made
little account of them, saying, “_that he went to fight an army without
a captain_,” indicating thereby the weakness of these generals. And,
conversely, when he went to encounter Pompeius in Thessaly, he said,
“_I go against a captain without an army_.”[13]

 [13] Professus ante inter suos, ire se ad exercitum sine duce, et inde
 reversurum ad ducem sine exercitu. (_Suet. in Vita J. Caes._)


A further question may also be raised, whether it is easier for a good
captain to make a good army, or for a good army to make a good captain.
As to this it might be thought there was barely room for doubt, since
it ought to be far easier for many who are good to find one who is good
or teach him to become so, than for one who is good to find or make
many good. Lucullus when sent against Mithridates was wholly without
experience in war: but his brave army, which was provided with many
excellent officers, speedily taught him to be a good captain. On the
other hand, when the Romans, being badly off for soldiers, armed a
number of slaves and gave them over to be drilled by Sempronius
Gracchus, he in a short time made them into a serviceable army. So too,
as I have already mentioned, Pelopidas and Epaminondas after rescuing
Thebes, their native city, from Spartan thraldom, in a short time made
such valiant soldiers of the Theban peasantry, as to be able with their
aid not only to withstand, but even to defeat the Spartan armies. So
that the question may seem to be equally balanced, excellence on one
side generally finding excellence on the other.

A good army, however, when left without a good leader, as the
Macedonian army was on the death of Alexander, or as those veterans
were who had fought in the civil wars, is apt to grow restless and
turbulent. Wherefore I am convinced that it is better to trust to the
captain who has time allowed him to discipline his men, and means
wherewith to equip them, than to a tumultuary host with a chance leader
of its own choosing. But twofold is the merit and twofold the glory of
those captains who not only have had to subdue their enemies, but also
before encountering them to organize and discipline their forces. This,
however, is a task requiring qualities so seldom combined, that were
many of those captains who now enjoy a great name with the world,
called on to perform it, they would be much less thought of than they
are.




CHAPTER XIV.—_Of the effect produced in Battle by strange and
unexpected Sights or Sounds._


That the disorder occasioned by strange and unexpected sights or sounds
may have momentous consequences in combat, might be shown by many
instances, but by none better than by what befell in the battle fought
between the Romans and the Volscians, when Quintius, the Roman general,
seeing one wing of his army begin to waver, shouted aloud to his men to
stand firm, for the other wing was already victorious. Which words of
his giving confidence to his own troops and striking the enemy with
dismay won him the battle. But if a cry like this, produce great effect
on a well disciplined army, far greater must be its effect on one which
is ill disciplined and disorderly. For by such a wind the whole mass
will be moved, as I shall show by a well-known instance happening in
our own times.

A few years ago the city of Perugia was split into the two factions of
the Baglioni and the Oddi, the former holding the government, the
latter being in exile. The Oddeschi, however, with the help of friends,
having got together an armed force which they lodged in villages of
their own near Perugia, obtained, by the favour of some of their party,
an entrance into the city by night, and moving forward without
discovery, came as far as the public square. And as all the streets of
Perugia are barred with chains drawn across them at their corners, the
Oddeschi had in front of them a man who carried an iron hammer
wherewith to break the fastenings of the chains so that horsemen might
pass. When the only chain remaining unbroken was that which closed the
public square, the alarm having now been given, the hammerman was so
impeded by the crowd pressing behind him that he could not raise his
arm to strike freely. Whereupon, to get more room for his work, he
called aloud to the others to stand back; and the word back passing
from rank to rank those furthest off began to run, and, presently, the
others also, with such precipitancy, that they fell into utter
disorder. In this way, and from this trifling circumstance, the attempt
of the Oddeschi came to nothing.

Here we may note that discipline is needed in an army, not so much to
enable it to fight according to a settled order, as that it may not be
thrown into confusion by every insignificant accident. For a tumultuary
host is useless in war, simply because every word, or cry, or sound,
may throw it into a panic and cause it to fly. Wherefore it behoves a
good captain to provide that certain fixed persons shall receive his
orders and pass them on to the rest, and to accustom his soldiers to
look to these persons, and to them only, to be informed what his orders
are. For whenever this precaution is neglected the gravest mishaps are
constantly seen to ensue.

As regards strange and unexpected sights, every captain should
endeavour while his army is actually engaged with the enemy, to effect
some such feint or diversion as will encourage his own men and dismay
his adversary since this of all things that can happen is the likeliest
to ensure victory. In evidence whereof we may cite the example of
Cneius Sulpitius, the Roman dictator, who, when about to give battle to
the Gauls, after arming his sutlers and camp followers, mounted them on
mules and other beasts of burden, furnished them with spears and
banners to look like cavalry, and placing them behind a hill, ordered
them on a given signal, when the fight was at the hottest, to appear
and show themselves to the enemy. All which being carried out as he had
arranged, threw the Gauls into such alarm, that they lost the battle.

A good captain, therefore, has two things to see to: first, to contrive
how by some sudden surprise he may throw his enemy into confusion; and
next, to be prepared should the enemy use a like stratagem against him
to discover and defeat it; as the stratagem of Semiramis was defeated
by the King of India. For Semiramis seeing that this king had elephants
in great numbers, to dismay him by showing that she, too, was well
supplied, caused the skins of many oxen and buffaloes to be sewn
together in the shape of elephants and placed upon camels and sent to
the front. But the trick being detected by the king, turned out not
only useless but hurtful to its contriver. In a battle which the
Dictator Mamercus fought against the people of Fidenae, the latter, to
strike terror into the minds of the Romans, contrived that while the
combat raged a number of soldiers should issue from Fidenae bearing
lances tipped with fire, thinking that the Romans, disturbed by so
strange a sight, would be thrown into confusion.

We are to note, however, with regard to such contrivances, that if they
are to serve any useful end, they should _be_ formidable as well as
_seem_ so; for when they menace a real danger, their weak points are
not so soon discerned. When they have more of pretence than reality, it
will be well either to dispense with them altogether, or resorting to
them, to keep them, like the muleteers of Sulpitius, in the background,
so that they be not too readily found out. For any weakness inherent in
them is soon discovered if they be brought near, when, as happened with
the elephants of Semiramis and the fiery spears of the men of Fidenae,
they do harm rather than good. For although by this last-mentioned
device the Romans at the first were somewhat disconcerted, so soon as
the dictator came up and began to chide them, asking if they were not
ashamed to fly like bees from smoke, and calling on them to turn on
their enemy, and “_with her own flames efface that Fidenae whom their
benefits could not conciliate_,” they took courage; so that the device
proved of no service to its contrivers, who were vanquished in the
battle.




CHAPTER XV.—_That one and not many should head an Army: and why it is
harmful to have more Leaders than one._


The men of Fidenae rising against the colonists whom the Romans had
settled among them, and putting them to the sword, the Romans to avenge
the insult appointed four tribunes with consular powers: one of whom
they retained to see to the defence of Rome, while the other three were
sent against the Fidenati and the Veientines. But these three falling
out among themselves, and being divided in their counsels, returned
from their mission with discredit though not with loss. Of which
discredit they were themselves the cause. That they sustained no loss
was due to the valour of their soldiers But the senate perceiving the
source of the mischief, to the end that one man might put to rights
what three had thrown into confusion, resorted to the appointment of a
dictator.

Here we see the disadvantage of having several leaders in one army or
in a town which has to defend itself. And the case could not be put in
clearer words than by Titus Livius, where he says, “_The three tribunes
with consular authority gave proof how hurtful it is in war to have
many leaders; for each forming a different opinion, and each abiding by
his own, they threw opportunities in the way of their enemies._” And
though this example suffice by itself to show the disadvantage in war
of divided commands, to make the matter still plainer I shall cite two
further instances, one ancient and one modern.

In the year 1500, Louis XII. of France, after recovering Milan, sent
troops to restore Pisa to the Florentines, Giovambattista Ridolfi and
Luca d’Antonio Albizzi going with them as commissaries. Now, because
Giovambattista had a great name, and was older than Luca, the latter
left the whole management of everything to him; and although he did not
show his jealousy of him by opposing him, he betrayed it by his
silence, and by being so careless and indifferent about everything,
that he gave no help in the business of the siege either by word or
deed, just as though he had been a person of no account. But when, in
consequence of an accident, Giovambattista had to return to Florence,
all this was changed; for Luca, remaining in sole charge, behaved with
the greatest courage, prudence, and zeal, all which qualities had been
hidden while he held a joint command. Further to bear me out I shall
again borrow the words of Titus Livius, who, in relating how when
Quintius and Agrippa his colleague were sent by the Romans against the
Equians, Agrippa contrived that the conduct of the war should rest with
Quintius, observes, “_Most wholesome is it that in affairs of great
moment, supreme authority be vested in one man._” Very different,
however, is the course followed by the republics and princes of our own
days, who, thinking to be better served, are used to appoint several
captains or commissioners to fill one command; a practice giving rise
to so much confusion, that were we seeking for the causes of the
overthrow of the French and Italian armies in recent times, we should
find this to be the most active of any.

Rightly, therefore, may we conclude that in sending forth an army upon
service, it is wiser to entrust it to one man of ordinary prudence,
than to two of great parts but with a divided command.




CHAPTER XVI.—_That in Times of Difficulty true Worth is sought after;
whereas in quiet Times it is not the most deserving, but those who are
recommended by Wealth or Connection who are most in favour._


It always has happened and always will, that the great and admirable
men of a republic are neglected in peaceful times; because at such
seasons many citizens are found, who, envying the reputation these men
have justly earned, seek to be regarded not merely as their equals but
as their superiors. Touching this there is a notable passage in
Thucydides, the Greek historian, where he tells how the republic of
Athens coming victorious out of the Peloponessian war, wherein she had
bridled the pride of Sparta, and brought almost the whole of Greece
under her authority, was encouraged by the greatness of her renown to
propose to herself the conquest of Sicily. In Athens this scheme was
much debated, Alcibiades and certain others who had the public welfare
very little in their thoughts, but who hoped that the enterprise, were
they placed in command, might minister to their fame, recommending that
it should be undertaken. Nicias, on the other hand, one of the best
esteemed of the Athenian citizens, was against it, and in addressing
the people, gave it as the strongest reason for trusting his advice,
that in advising them not to engage in this war, he urged what was not
for his own advantage; for he knew that while Athens remained at peace
numberless citizens were ready to take precedence of him: whereas, were
war declared, he was certain that none would rank before him or even be
looked upon as his equal.

Here we see that in tranquil times republics are subject to the
infirmity of lightly esteeming their worthiest citizens. And this
offends these persons for two reasons: first, because they are not
given the place they deserve; and second, because they see unworthy men
and of abilities inferior to their own, as much or more considered than
they. Injustice such as this has caused the ruin of many republics. For
citizens who find themselves undeservedly slighted, and perceive the
cause to be that the times are tranquil and not troubled, will strive
to change the times by stirring up wars hurtful to the public welfare.
When I look for remedies for this state of things, I find two: first,
to keep the citizens poor, so that wealth without worth shall corrupt
neither them nor others; second, to be so prepared for war as always to
be ready to make war; for then there will always be a need for worthy
citizens, as was the case in Rome in early times. For as Rome
constantly kept her armies in the field, there was constant opportunity
for men to display their valour, nor was it possible to deprive a
deserving man of his post and give it to another who was not deserving.
Or if ever this were done by inadvertency, or by way of experiment,
there forthwith resulted such disorder and danger, that the city at
once retraced its steps and reverted to the true path. But other
republics which are not regulated on the same plan, and make war only
when driven to it by necessity, cannot help committing this injustice,
nay, will constantly run into it, when, if the great citizen who finds
himself slighted be vindictive, and have some credit and following in
the city, disorder will always ensue. And though Rome escaped this
danger for a time, she too, as has elsewhere been said, having no
longer, after she had conquered Carthage and Antiochus, any fear of
war, came to think she might commit her armies to whom she would,
making less account of the valour of her captains than of those other
qualities which gain favour with the people. Accordingly we find Paulus
Emilius rejected oftener than once when he sought the consulship; nor,
in fact, obtaining it until the Macedonian war broke out, which, being
judged a formidable business, was by the voice of the whole city
committed to his management. After the year 1494 our city of Florence
was involved in a series of wars, in conducting which none of our
citizens had any success until chance threw the command into the hands
of one who showed us how an army should be led. This was Antonio
Giacomini, and so long as there were dangerous wars on foot, all
rivalry on the part of other citizens was suspended; and whenever a
captain or commissary had to be appointed he was unopposed. But when a
war came to be undertaken, as to the issue of which no misgivings were
felt, and which promised both honour and preferment, so numerous were
the competitors for command, that three commissaries having to be
chosen to conduct the siege of Pisa, Antonio was left out; and though
it cannot with certainty be shown that any harm resulted to our
republic from his not having been sent on this enterprise, we may
reasonably conjecture that such was indeed the case. For as the people
of Pisa were then without means either for subsistence or defence, it
may be believed that had Antonio been there he would have reduced them
to such extremities as would have forced them to surrender at
discretion to the Florentines. But Pisa being besieged by captains who
knew neither how to blockade nor how to storm it, held out so long,
that the Florentines, who should have reduced it by force, were obliged
to buy its submission. Neglect like this might well move Antonio to
resentment; and he must needs have been both very patient and very
forgiving if he felt no desire to revenge himself when he could, by the
ruin of the city or by injuries to individual citizens. But a republic
should beware not to rouse such feelings, as I shall show in the
following Chapter.




CHAPTER XVII.—_That we are not to offend a Man, and then send him to
fill an important Office or Command._


A republic should think twice before appointing to an important command
a citizen who has sustained notable wrong at the hands of his
fellow-citizens. Claudius Nero, quitting the army with which he was
opposing Hannibal, went with a part of his forces into the March of
Ancona, designing to join the other consul there, and after joining him
to attack Hasdrubal before he came up with his brother. Now Claudius
had previously commanded against Hasdrubal in Spain, and after driving
him with his army into such a position that it seemed he must either
fight at a disadvantage or perish by famine, had been outwitted by his
adversary, who, while diverting his attention with proposals of terms,
contrived to slip through his hands and rob him of the opportunity for
effecting his destruction. This becoming known in Rome brought Claudius
into so much discredit both with the senate and people, that to his
great mortification and displeasure, he was slightingly spoken of by
the whole city. But being afterwards made consul and sent to oppose
Hannibal, he took the course mentioned above, which was in itself so
hazardous that all Rome was filled with doubt and anxiety until tidings
came of Hasdrubal’s defeat. When subsequently asked why he had played
so dangerous a game, wherein without urgent necessity he had staked the
very existence of Rome, Claudius answered, he had done so because he
knew that were he to succeed he would recover whatever credit he had
lost in Spain; while if he failed, and his attempt had an untoward
issue, he would be revenged on that city and On those citizens who had
so ungratefully and indiscreetly wronged him.

But if resentment for an offence like this so deeply moved a Roman
citizen at a time when Rome was still uncorrupted, we should consider
how it may act on the citizen of a State not constituted as Rome then
was. And because there is no certain remedy we can apply to such
disorders when they arise in republics, it follows that it is
impossible to establish a republic which shall endure always; since in
a thousand unforeseen ways ruin may overtake it.




CHAPTER XVIII.—_That it is the highest Quality of a Captain to be able
to forestall the designs of his Adversary._


It was a saying of Epaminondas the Theban that nothing was so useful
and necessary for a commander as to be able to see through the
intentions and designs of his adversary. And because it is hard to come
at this knowledge directly, the more credit is due to him who reaches
it by conjecture. Yet sometimes it is easier to fathom an enemy’s
designs than to construe his actions; and not so much those actions
which are done at a distance from us, as those done in our presence and
under our very eyes. For instance, it has often happened that when a
battle has lasted till nightfall, the winner has believed himself the
loser, and the loser has believed himself the winner and that this
mistake has led him who made it to follow a course hurtful to himself.
It was from a mistake of this sort, that Brutus and Cassius lost the
battle of Philippi. For though Brutus was victorious with his wing of
the army Cassius, whose wing was beaten, believed the entire army to be
defeated, and under this belief gave way to despair and slew himself.
So too, in our own days, in the battle fought by Francis, king of
France, with the Swiss at Santa Cecilia in Lombardy, when night fell,
those of the Swiss who remained unbroken, not knowing that the rest had
been routed and slain, thought they had the victory; and so believing
would not retreat, but, remaining on the field, renewed the combat the
following morning to their great disadvantage. Nor were they the only
sufferers from their mistake, since the armies of the Pope and of Spain
were also misled by it, and well-nigh brought to destruction. For on
the false report of a victory they crossed the Po, and had they only
advanced a little further must have been made prisoners by the
victorious French.

An instance is recorded of a like mistake having been made in the camps
both of the Romans and of the Equians. For the Consul Sempronius being
in command against the Equians, and giving the enemy battle, the
engagement lasted with varying success till nightfall, when as both
armies had suffered what was almost a defeat, neither returned to their
camp, but each drew off to the neighboring hills where they thought
they would be safer. The Romans separated into two divisions, one of
which with the consul, the other with the centurion Tempanius by whose
valour the army had that day been saved from utter rout. At daybreak
the consul, without waiting for further tidings of the enemy, made
straight for Rome; and the Equians, in like manner, withdrew to their
own country. For as each supposed the other to be victorious, neither
thought much of leaving their camp to be plundered by the enemy. It so
chanced, however, that Tempanius, who was himself retreating with the
second division of the Roman army, fell in with certain wounded
Equians, from whom he learned that their commanders had fled,
abandoning their camp; on hearing which, he at once returned to the
Roman camp and secured it, and then, after sacking the camp of the
Equians, went back victorious to Rome. His success, as we see, turned
entirely on his being the first to be informed of the enemy’s
condition. And here we are to note that it may often happen that both
the one and the other of two opposed armies shall fall into the same
disorder, and be reduced to the same straits; in which case, that which
soonest detects the other’s distress is sure to come off best.

I shall give an instance of this which occurred recently in our own
country. In the year 1498, when the Florentines had a great army in the
territory of Pisa and had closely invested the town, the Venetians, who
had undertaken its protection, seeing no other way to save it, resolved
to make a diversion in its favour by attacking the territories of the
Florentines in another quarter. Wherefore, having assembled a strong
force, they entered Tuscany by the Val di Lamona, and seizing on the
village of Marradi, besieged the stronghold of Castiglione which stands
on the height above it. Getting word of this, the Florentines sought to
relieve Marradi, without weakening the army which lay round Pisa. They
accordingly raised a new levy of foot-soldiers, and equipped a fresh
squadron of horse, which they despatched to Marradi under the joint
command of Jacopo IV. d’Appiano, lord of Piombino, and Count Rinuccio
of Marciano. These troops taking up their position on the hill above
Marradi, the Venetians withdrew from the investment of Castiglione and
lodged themselves in the village. But when the two armies had
confronted one another for several days, both began to suffer sorely
from want of victuals and other necessaries, and neither of them daring
to attack the other, or knowing to what extremities the other was
reduced, both simultaneously resolved to strike their camps the
following morning, and to retreat, the Venetians towards Berzighella
and Faenza, the Florentines towards Casaglia and the Mugello. But at
daybreak, when both armies had begun to remove their baggage, it so
happened that an old woman, whose years and poverty permitted her to
pass unnoticed, leaving the village of Marradi, came to the Florentine
camp, where were certain of her kinsfolk whom she desired to visit.
Learning from her that the Venetians were in retreat, the Florentine
commanders took courage, and changing their plan, went in pursuit of
the enemy as though they had dislodged them, sending word to Florence
that they had repulsed the Venetians and gained a victory. But in truth
this victory was wholly due to their having notice of the enemy’s
movements before the latter had notice of theirs. For had that notice
been given to the Venetians first, it would have wrought against us the
same results as it actually wrought for us.




CHAPTER XIX.—_Whether Indulgence or Severity be more necessary for
controlling a Multitude._


The Roman Republic was distracted by the feuds of the nobles and
commons. Nevertheless, on war breaking out, Quintius and Appius
Claudius were sent forth in command of Roman armies. From his harshness
and severity to his soldiers, Appius was so ill obeyed by them, that
after sustaining what almost amounted to a defeat, he had to resign his
command. Quintius, on the contrary, by kindly and humane treatment,
kept his men obedient and returned victorious to Rome. From this it
might seem that to govern a large body of men, it is better to be
humane than haughty, and kindly rather than severe.

And yet Cornelius Tacitus, with whom many other authors are agreed,
pronounces a contrary opinion where he says, “_In governing a multitude
it avails more to punish than to be compliant._”[14] If it be asked how
these opposite views can be reconciled, I answer that you exercise
authority either over men used to regard you as their equal, or over
men who have always been subject to you. When those over whom you
exercise authority are your equals, you cannot trust wholly to
punishment or to that severity of which Tacitus speaks. And since in
Rome itself the commons had equal weight with the nobles, none
appointed their captain for a time only, could control them by using
harshness and severity. Accordingly we find that those Roman captains
who gained the love of their soldiers and were considerate of them,
often achieved greater results than those who made themselves feared by
them in an unusual degree, unless, like Manlius Torquatus, these last
were endowed with consummate valour. But he who has to govern subjects
such as those of whom Tacitus speaks, to prevent their growing insolent
and trampling upon him by reason of his too great easiness, must resort
to punishment rather than to compliance. Still, to escape hatred,
punishment should be moderate in degree, for to make himself hated is
never for the interest of any prince. And to escape hatred, a prince
has chiefly to guard against tampering with the property of any of his
subjects; for where nothing is to be gained by it, no prince will
desire to shed blood, unless, as seldom happens, constrained to do so
by necessity. But where advantage is to be gained thereby, blood will
always flow, and neither the desire to shed it, nor causes for shedding
it will ever be wanting, as I have fully shown when discussing this
subject in another treatise.

 [14] “In multitudine regenda plus poena quam obsequium valet.” But
 compare Annals, III. 55, “Obsequium inde in principem et æmulandi amoi
 validioi quam poena ex legibus et metus.”


Quintius therefore was more deserving of praise than Appius.
Nevertheless the opinion of Tacitus, duly restricted and not understood
as applying to a case like that of Appius, merits approval. But since I
have spoken of punishment and indulgence, it seems not out of place to
show how a single act of humanity availed more than arms with the
citizens of Falerii.




CHAPTER XX.—_How one humane act availed more with the men of Falerii,
than all the might of the Roman Arms._


When the besieging army of the Romans lay round Falerii, the master of
a school wherein the best-born youths of the city were taught, thinking
to curry favour with Camillus and the Romans, came forth from the town
with these boys, on pretence of giving them exercise, and bringing them
into the camp where Camillus was, presented them to him, saying, “_To
ransom these that city would yield itself into your hands._” Camillus,
however, not only rejected this offer, but causing the schoolmaster to
be stripped and his hands tied behind him, gave each of the boys a
scourge, and bade them lead the fellow back to the town scourging him
as they went. When the citizens of Falerii heard of this, so much were
they pleased with the humanity and integrity of Camillus, that they
resolved to surrender their town to him without further defence.

This authentic instance may lead us to believe that a humane and kindly
action may sometimes touch men’s minds more nearly than a harsh and
cruel one; and that those cities and provinces into which the
instruments and engines of war, with every other violence to which men
resort, have failed to force a way, may be thrown open to a single act
of tenderness, mercy, chastity, or generosity. Whereof history supplies
us with many examples besides the one which I have just now noticed.
For we find that when the arms of Rome were powerless to drive Pyrrhus
out of Italy, he was moved to depart by the generosity of Fabritius in
disclosing to him the proposal which his slave had made the Romans to
poison him. Again, we read how Scipio gained less reputation in Spain
by the capture of New Carthage, than by his virtue in restoring a young
and beautiful wife unviolated to her husband; the fame of which action
won him the love of the whole province. We see, too, how much this
generous temper is esteemed by a people in its great men; and how much
it is praised by historians and by those who write the lives of
princes, as well as by those who lay down rules of human conduct. Among
whom Xenophon has taken great pains to show what honours, and
victories, and how fair a fame accrued to Cyrus from his being kindly
and gracious, without taint of pride, or cruelty, or luxury, or any
other of those vices which cast a stain upon men’s lives.

And yet when we note that Hannibal, by methods wholly opposite to
these, achieved splendid victories and a great renown, I think I am
bound to say something in my next Chapter as to how this happened.




CHAPTER XXI.—_How it happened that Hannibal pursuing a course contrary
to that taken by Scipio, wrought the same results in Italy which the
other achieved in Spain._


Some, I suspect, may marvel to find a captain, taking a contrary
course, nevertheless arrive at the same ends as those who have pursued
the methods above spoken of; since it must seem as though success did
not depend on the causes I have named; nay, that if glory and fame are
to be won in other ways, these causes neither add to our strength nor
advance our fortunes. Wherefore, to make my meaning plain, and not to
part company with the men of whom I have been speaking, I say, that as,
on the one hand, we see Scipio enter Spain, and by his humane and
generous conduct at once secure the good-will of the province, and the
admiration and reverence of its inhabitants, so on the other hand, we
see Hannibal enter Italy, and by methods wholly opposite, to wit, by
violence and rapine, by cruelty and treachery of every kind, effect in
that country the very same results. For all the States of Italy
revolted in his favour, and all the Italian nations ranged themselves
on his side.

When we seek to know why this was, several reasons present themselves,
the first being that men so passionately love change, that, commonly
speaking, those who are well off are as eager for it as those who are
badly off: for as already has been said with truth, men are pampered by
prosperity, soured by adversity. This love of change, therefore, makes
them open the door to any one who puts himself at the head of new
movements in their country, and if he be a foreigner they adopt his
cause, if a fellow-countryman they gather round him and become his
partisans and supporters; so that whatever methods he may there use, he
will succeed in making great progress. Moreover, men being moved by two
chief passions, love and fear, he who makes himself feared commands
with no less authority than he who makes himself loved; nay, as a rule,
is followed and obeyed more implicitly than the other. It matters
little, however, which of these two ways a captain chooses to follow,
provided he be of transcendent valour, and has thereby won for himself
a great name For when, like Hannibal or Scipio, a man is very valiant,
this quality will cloak any error he may commit in seeking either to be
too much loved or too much feared. Yet from each of these two
tendencies, grave mischiefs, and such as lead to the ruin of a prince,
may arise. For he who would be greatly loved, if he swerve ever so
little from the right road, becomes contemptible; while he who would be
greatly feared, if he go a jot too far, incurs hatred. And since it is
impossible, our nature not allowing it, to adhere to the exact mean, it
is essential that any excess should be balanced by an exceeding valour,
as it was in Hannibal and Scipio. And yet we find that even they, while
they were exalted by the methods they followed, were also injured by
them. How they were exalted has been shown. The injury which Scipio
suffered was, that in Spain his soldiers, in concert with certain of
his allies, rose against him, for no other reason than that they stood
in no fear of him. For men are so restless, that if ever so small a
door be opened to their ambition, they forthwith forget all the love
they have borne their prince in return for his graciousness and
goodness, as did these soldiers and allies of Scipio; when, to correct
the mischief, he was forced to use something of a cruelty foreign to
his nature.

As to Hannibal, we cannot point to any particular instance wherein his
cruelty or want of faith are seen to have been directly hurtful to him;
but we may well believe that Naples and other towns which remained
loyal to the Roman people, did so by reason of the dread which his
character inspired. This, however, is abundantly clear, that his
inhumanity made him more detested by the Romans than any other enemy
they ever had; so that while to Pyrrhus, in Italy with his army, they
gave up the traitor who offered to poison him, Hannibal, even when
disarmed and a fugitive, they never forgave, until they had compassed
his death.

To Hannibal, therefore, from his being accounted impious, perfidious,
and cruel, these disadvantages resulted; but, on the other hand, there
accrued to him one great gain, noticed with admiration by all
historians, namely, that in his army, although made up of men of every
race and country, no dissensions ever broke out among the soldiers
themselves, nor any mutiny against their leader. This we can only
ascribe to the awe which his character inspired, which together with
the great name his valour had won for him, had the effect of keeping
his soldiers quiet and united. I repeat, therefore, that it is of
little moment which method a captain may follow if he be endowed with
such valour as will bear him out in the course which he adopts. For, as
I have said, there are disadvantages incident to both methods unless
corrected by extraordinary valour.

And now, since I have spoken of Scipio and Hannibal, the former of whom
by praiseworthy, the latter by odious qualities, effected the same
results, I must not, I think, omit to notice the characters of two
Roman citizens, who by different, yet both by honourable methods,
obtained a like glory.




Chapter XXII.—_That the severity of Manlius Torquatus and the
gentleness of Valerius Corvinus won for both the same Glory._


There lived in Rome, at the same time, two excellent captains, Manlius
Torquatus and Valerius Corvinus, equal in their triumphs and in their
renown, and in the valour which in obtaining these they had displayed
against the enemy; but who in the conduct of their armies and treatment
of their soldiers, followed very different methods. For Manlius, in his
command, resorted to every kind of severity, never sparing his men
fatigue, nor remitting punishment; while Valerius, on the contrary,
treated them with all kindness and consideration, and was easy and
familiar in his intercourse with them. So that while the one, to secure
the obedience of his soldiers, put his own son to death, the other
never dealt harshly with any man. Yet, for all this diversity in their
modes of acting, each had the same success against the enemy, and each
obtained the same advantages both for the republic and for himself. For
no soldier of theirs ever flinched in battle, or rose in mutiny against
them, or in any particular opposed their will; though the commands of
Manlius were of such severity that any order of excessive rigour came
to be spoken of as a _Manlian order_.

Here, then, we have to consider first of all why Manlius was obliged to
use such severity; next, why Valerius could behave so humanely;
thirdly, how it was that these opposite methods had the same results;
and lastly, which of the two methods it is better and more useful for
us to follow. Now, if we well examine the character of Manlius from the
moment when Titus Livius first begins to make mention of him, we shall
find him to have been endowed with a rare vigour both of mind and body,
dutiful in his behaviour to his father and to his country, and most
reverent to his superiors. All which we see in his slaying the Gaul, in
his defence of his father against the tribune, and in the words in
which, before going forth to fight the Gaul, he addressed the consul,
when he said, “_Although assured of victory, never will I without thy
bidding engage an enemy._” But when such a man as this attains to
command, he looks to find all others like himself; his dauntless spirit
prompts him to engage in daring enterprises, and to insist on their
being carried out. And this is certain, that where things hard to
execute are ordered to be done, the order must be enforced with
sternness, since, otherwise, it will be disobeyed.

And here be it noted that if you would be obeyed you must know how to
command, and that they alone have this knowledge who have measured
their power to enforce, with the willingness of others to yield
obedience; and who issue their orders when they find these conditions
combining, but, otherwise, abstain. Wherefore, a wise man was wont to
say that to hold a republic by force, there must be a proportion
between him who uses the force and him against whom it is used; and
that while this proportion obtains the force will operate; but that
when he who suffers is stronger than he who uses the force, we may
expect to see it brought to an end at any moment.

But returning to the matter in hand, I say that to command things hard
of execution, requires hardness in him who gives the command, and that
a man of this temper and who issues such commands, cannot look to
enforce them by gentleness. He who is not of such a temper must be
careful not to impose tasks of extraordinary difficulty, but may use
his natural gentleness in imposing such as are ordinary. For common
punishments are not imputed to the prince, but to the laws and
ordinances which he has to administer.

We must believe, therefore, that Manlius was constrained to act with
severity by the unusual character of the commands which his natural
disposition prompted him to issue. Such commands are useful in a
republic, as restoring its ordinances to their original efficacy and
excellence. And were a republic, as I have before observed, fortunate
enough to come frequently under the influence of men who, by their
example, reinforce its laws, and not only retard its progress towards
corruption, but bring it back to its first perfection, it might endure
for ever.

Manlius, therefore, was of those who by the severity of their commands
maintained the military discipline of Rome; urged thereto, in the first
place, by his natural temper, and next by the desire that whatever he
was minded to command should be done. Valerius, on the other hand,
could afford to act humanely, because for him it was enough if all were
done which in a Roman army it was customary to do. And, since the
customs of that army were good customs, they sufficed to gain him
honour, while at the same time their maintenance cost him no effort,
nor threw on him the burthen of punishing transgressors; as well
because there were none who trangressed, as because had there been any,
they would, as I have said, have imputed their punishment to the
ordinary rules of discipline, and not to the severity of their
commander. In this way Valerius had room to exercise that humane
disposition which enabled him at once to gain influence over his
soldiers and to content them. Hence it was that both these captains
obtaining the same obedience, could, while following different methods,
arrive at the same ends. Those, however, who seek to imitate them may
chance to fall into the errors of which I have already spoken, in
connection with Hannibal and Scipio, as breeding contempt or hatred,
and which are only to be corrected by the presence of extraordinary
valour, and not otherwise.

It rests now to determine which of these two methods is the more to be
commended. This, I take it, is matter of dispute, since both methods
have their advocates. Those writers, however, who have laid down rules
for the conduct of princes, describe a character approaching more
nearly to that of Valerius than to that of Manlius; and Xenophon, whom
I have already cited, while giving many instances of the humanity of
Cyrus, conforms closely to what Livius tells us of Valerius. For
Valerius being made consul against the Samnites, on the eve of battle
spoke to his men with the same kindliness with which he always treated
them; and Livius, after telling us what he said, remarks of him:
“_Never was there a leader more familiar with his men; cheerfully
sharing with the meanest among them every hardship and fatigue. Even in
the military games, wherein those of the same rank were wont to make
trial of their strength or swiftness, he would good-naturedly take a
part, nor disdain any adversary who offered; meeting victory or defeat
with an unruffled temper and an unchanged countenance. When called on
to act, his bounty and generosity never fell short. When he had to
speak, he was as mindful of the feelings of others as of his own
dignity. And, what more than anything else secures the popular favour,
he maintained when exercising his magistracies the same bearing he had
worn in seeking them._”

Of Manlius also, Titus Livius speaks in like honourable terms, pointing
out that his severity in putting his son to death brought the Roman
army to that pitch of discipline which enabled it to prevail against
the Latins, nay, he goes so far in his praises that after describing
the whole order of the battle, comparing the strength of both armies,
and showing all the dangers the Romans ran, and the difficulties they
had to surmount, he winds up by saying, that it was the valour of
Manlius which alone gained for them this great victory, and that
whichever side had Manlius for its leader must have won the day. So
that weighing all that the historians tell us of these two captains, it
might be difficult to decide between them.

Nevertheless, not to leave the question entirely open, I say, that for
a citizen living under a republic, I think the conduct of Manlius more
deserving of praise and less dangerous in its consequences. For methods
like his tend only to the public good and in no way subserve private
ends. He who shows himself harsh and stern at all times and to all men
alike, and is seen to care only for the common welfare, will never gain
himself partisans, since this is not the way to win personal friends,
to whom, as I said before, the name of partisans is given. For a
republic, therefore, no line of conduct could be more useful or more to
be desired than this, because in following it the public interest is
not neglected, and no room is given to suspect personal ambition.

But the contrary holds as to the methods followed by Valerius. For
though the public service they render be the same, misgivings must
needs arise that the personal good-will which, in the course of a
prolonged command, a captain obtains from his soldiers, may lead to
consequences fatal to the public liberty. And if this was not found to
happen in the case of Valerius, it was because the minds of the Roman
people were not yet corrupted, and because they had never remained for
a long time and continuously under his command.

Had we, however, like Xenophon, to consider what is most for the
interest of a prince, we should have to give up Manlius and hold by
Valerius; for, undoubtedly, a prince should strive to gain the love of
his soldiers and subjects, as well as their obedience. The latter he
can secure by discipline and by his reputation for valour. But for the
former he will be indebted to his affability, kindliness, gentleness,
and all those other like qualities which were possessed by Valerius,
and which are described by Xenophon as existing in Cyrus. That a prince
should be personally loved and have his army wholly devoted to him is
consistent with the character of his government; but that this should
happen to a person of private station does not consist with his
position as a citizen who has to live in conformity with the laws and
in subordination to the magistrates. We read in the early annals of the
Venetian Republic, that once, on the return of the fleet, a dispute
broke out between the sailors and the people, resulting in tumults and
armed violence which neither the efforts of the public officers, the
respect felt for particular citizens, nor the authority of the
magistrates could quell. But on a certain gentleman, who the year
before had been in command of these sailors, showing himself among
them, straightway, from the love they bore him, they submitted to his
authority and withdrew from the fray. Which deference on their part
aroused such jealousy and suspicion in the minds of the Venetian
senators that very soon after they got rid of this gentleman, either by
death or exile.

The sum of the matter, therefore, is, that the methods followed by
Valerius are useful in a prince, but pernicious in a private citizen,
both for his country and for himself, for his country, because such
methods pave the way to a tyranny; for himself, because his
fellow-citizens, growing suspicious of his conduct, are constrained to
protect themselves to his hurt. And conversely, I maintain, that the
methods of Manlius, while hurtful in a prince are useful in a citizen,
and in the highest degree for his country; and, moreover, seldom give
offence, unless the hatred caused by his severity be augmented by the
jealousy which the fame of his other virtues inspires: a matter now to
be considered in connection with the banishment of Camillas.




CHAPTER XXIII.—_Why Camillus was banished from Rome._


It has been shown above how methods like those of Valerius are hurtful
to the citizen who employs them and to his country, while methods like
those of Manlius are advantageous for a man’s country, though sometimes
they be hurtful to the man himself. This is well seen in the example of
Camillus, whose bearing more nearly resembled that of Manlius than that
of Valerius, so that Titus Livius, in speaking of him, says, “_His
virtues were at once hated and admired by his soldiers._” What gained
him their admiration was his care for their safety, his prudence, his
magnanimity, and the good order he maintained in conducting and
commanding them. What made him hated was his being more stern to punish
than bountiful to reward; and Livius instances the following
circumstances as giving rise to this hatred. First, his having applied
the money got by the sale of the goods of the Veientines to public
purposes, and not divided it along with the rest of the spoils. Second,
his having, on the occasion of his triumph, caused his chariot to be
drawn by four white horses, seeking in his pride, men said, to make
himself the equal of the sun god. And, third, his having vowed to
Apollo a tenth of the Veientine plunder, which, if he was to fulfil his
vow, he had to recover from his soldiers, into whose hands it had
already come.

Herein we may well and readily discern what causes tend to make a
prince hateful to his people; the chief whereof is the depriving them
of some advantage. And this is a matter of much importance. For when a
man is deprived of what is in itself useful, he never forgets it, and
every trifling occasion recalls it to his mind; and because such
occasions recur daily, he is every day reminded of his loss. Another
error which we are here taught to guard against, is the appearing
haughty and proud, than which nothing is more distasteful to a people,
and most of all to a free people; for although such pride and
haughtiness do them no hurt, they nevertheless hold in detestation any
who display these qualities. Every show of pride, therefore, a prince
should shun as he would a rock, since to invite hatred without
resulting advantage were utterly rash and futile.




CHAPTER XXIV.—_That prolonged Commands brought Rome to Servitude_.


If we well examine the course of Roman history, we shall find two
causes leading to the break-up of that republic: one, the dissensions
which arose in connection with the agrarian laws; the other, the
prolongation of commands. For had these matters been rightly understood
from the first, and due remedies applied, the freedom of Rome had been
far more lasting, and, possibly, less disturbed. And although, as
touching the prolongation of commands, we never find any tumult
breaking out in Rome on that account, we do in fact discern how much
harm was done to the city by the ascendency which certain of its
citizens thereby gained. This mischief indeed would not have arisen, if
other citizens whose period of office was extended had been as good and
wise as Lucius Quintius, whose virtue affords a notable example. For
terms of accord having been settled between the senate and commons of
Rome, the latter, thinking their tribunes well able to withstand the
ambition of the nobles, prolonged their authority for a year.
Whereupon, the senate, not to be outdone by the commons, proposed, out
of rivalry, to extend the consulship of Quintius. He, however, refused
absolutely to lend himself to their designs, and insisted on their
appointing new consuls, telling them that they should seek to discredit
evil examples, not add to them by setting worse. Had this prudence and
virtue of his been shared by all the citizens of Rome, the practice of
prolonging the terms of civil offices would not have been suffered to
establish itself, nor have led to the kindred practice of extending the
term of military commands, which in progress of time effected the ruin
of their republic.

The first military commander whose term was extended, was Publius
Philo; for when his consulship was about to expire, he being then
engaged in the siege of Palæopolis, the senate, seeing he had the
victory in his hands, would not displace him by a successor, but
appointed him _Proconsul_, which office he was the first to hold. Now,
although in thus acting the senate did what they thought best for the
public good, nevertheless it was this act of theirs that in time
brought Rome to slavery. For the further the Romans carried their arms,
the more necessary it seemed to them to grant similar extensions of
command, and the oftener they, in fact, did so. This gave rise to two
disadvantages: first that a smaller number of men were trained to
command; second, that by the long continuance of his command a captain
gained so much influence and ascendency over his soldiers that in time
they came to hold the senate of no account, and looked only to him.
This it was, that enabled Sylla and Marius to find adherents ready to
follow them even to the public detriment, and enabled Cæsar to
overthrow the liberties of his country; whereas, had the Romans never
prolonged the period of authority, whether civil or military, though
they might have taken longer to build up their empire, they certainly
had been later in incurring servitude.




CHAPTER XXV.—_Of the poverty of Cincinnatus and of many other Roman
Citizens.


Elsewhere I have shown that no ordinance is of such advantage to a
commonwealth, as one which enforces poverty on its citizens. And
although it does not appear what particular law it was that had this
operation in Rome (especially since we know the agrarian law to have
been stubbornly resisted), we find, as a fact, that four hundred years
after the city was founded, great poverty still prevailed there; and
may assume that nothing helped so much to produce this result as the
knowledge that the path to honours and preferment was closed to none,
and that merit was sought after wheresoever it was to be found; for
this manner of conferring honours made riches the less courted. In
proof whereof I shall cite one instance only.

When the consul Minutius was beset in his camp by the Equians, the
Roman people were filled with such alarm lest their army should be
destroyed, that they appointed a dictator, always their last stay in
seasons of peril. Their choice fell on Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, who
at the time was living on his small farm of little more than four
acres, which he tilled with his own hand. The story is nobly told by
Titus Livius where he says: “_This is worth listening to by those who
contemn all things human as compared with riches, and think that glory
and excellence can have no place unless accompanied by lavish wealth._”
Cincinnatus, then, was ploughing in his little field, when there
arrived from Rome the messengers sent by the senate to tell him he had
been made dictator, and inform him of the dangers which threatened the
Republic. Putting on his gown, he hastened to Rome, and getting
together an army, marched to deliver Minutius. But when he had defeated
and spoiled the enemy, and released Minutius, he would not suffer the
army he had rescued to participate in the spoils, saying, “_I will not
have you share in the plunder of those to whom you had so nearly fallen
a prey._” Minutius he deprived of his consulship, and reduced to be a
subaltern, in which rank he bade him remain till he had learned how to
command. And before this he had made Lucius Tarquininus, although
forced by his poverty to serve on foot, his master of the knights.

Here, then, we see what honour was paid in Rome to poverty, and how
four acres of land sufficed to support so good and great a man as
Cincinnatus. We find the same Poverty still prevailing in the time of
Marcus Regulus, who when serving with the army in Africa sought leave
of senate to return home that he might look after his farm which his
labourers had suffered to run to waste. Here again we learn two things
worthy our attention: first, the poverty of these men and their
contentment under it, and how their sole study was to gain renown from
war, leaving all its advantages to the State. For had they thought of
enriching themselves by war, it had given them little concern that
their fields were running to waste Further, we have to remark the
magnanimity of these citizens, who when placed at the head of armies
surpassed all princes in the loftiness of their spirit, who cared
neither for king nor for commonwealth, and whom nothing could daunt or
dismay; but who, on returning to private life, became once more so
humble, so frugal, so careful of their slender means, and so submissive
to the magistrates and reverential to their superiors, that it might
seem impossible for the human mind to undergo so violent a change.

This poverty prevailed down to the days of Paulus Emilius, almost the
last happy days for this republic wherein a citizen, while enriching
Rome by his triumphs, himself remained poor. And yet so greatly was
poverty still esteemed at this time, that when Paulus, in conferring
rewards on those who had behaved well in the war, presented his own
son-in-law with a silver cup, it was the first vessel of silver ever
seen in his house.

I might run on to a great length pointing out how much better are the
fruits of poverty than those of riches, and how poverty has brought
cities, provinces, and nations to honour, while riches have wrought
their ruin, had not this subject been often treated by others.




CHAPTER XXVI.—_How Women are a cause of the ruin of States._


A feud broke out in Ardea touching the marriage of an heiress, whose
hand was sought at the same time by two suitors, the one of plebeian,
the other of noble birth. For her father being dead, her guardian
wished her to wed the plebeian, her mother the noble. And so hot grew
the dispute that resort was had to arms, the whole nobility siding with
their fellow-noble, and all the plebeians with the plebeian. The latter
faction being worsted, left the town, and sent to the Volscians for
help; whereupon, the nobles sought help from Rome. The Volscians were
first in the field, and on their arrival encamped round Ardea. The
Romans, coming up later, shut in the Volscians between themselves and
the town, and, reducing them by famine, forced them to surrender at
discretion. They then entered Ardea, and putting all the ringleaders in
this dispute to the sword, composed the disorders of the city.

In connection with this affair there are several points to be noted.
And in the first place we see how women have been the occasion of many
divisions and calamities in States, and have wrought great harm to
rulers; as when, according to our historian, the violence done to
Lucretia drove the Tarquins from their kingdom, and that done to
Virginia broke the power of the decemvirs. And among the chief causes
which Aristotle assigns for the downfall of tyrants are the wrongs done
by them to their subjects in respect of their women, whether by
adultery, rape, or other like injury to their honour, as has been
sufficiently noticed in the Chapter wherein we treated “_of
Conspiracies_”

I say, then, that neither absolute princes nor the rulers of free
States should underrate the importance of matter, but take heed to the
disorders which it may breed and provide against them while remedies
can still be used without discredit to themselves or to their
governments And this should have been done by the rulers of Ardea who
by suffering the rivalry between their citizens to come to a head,
promoted their divisions, and when they sought to reunite them had to
summon foreign help, than which nothing sooner leads to servitude.

But now let us turn to another subject which merits attention, namely,
the means whereby divided cities may be reunited; and of this I propose
to speak in the following Chapter.




CHAPTER XXVII.—_How a divided City may be reunited, and how it is a
false opinion that to hold Cities in subjection they must be kept
divided._


From the example of the Roman consuls who reconciled the citizens of
Ardea, we are taught the method whereby the feuds of a divided city may
be composed, namely, by putting the ringleaders of the disturbances to
death; and that no other remedy should be used. Three courses, indeed,
are open to you, since you may either put to death, as these consuls
did, or banish, or bind the citizens to live at peace with one another,
taking security for their good behaviour. Of which three ways the last
is the most hurtful, the most uncertain, and the least effectual;
because when much blood has been shed, or other like outrage done, it
cannot be that a peace imposed on compulsion should endure between men
who are every day brought face to face with one another; for since
fresh cause of contention may at any moment result from their meeting,
it will be impossible for them to refrain from mutual injury. Of this
we could have no better instance than in the city of Pistoja.

Fifteen years ago this city was divided between the Panciatichi and
Cancellieri, as indeed it still continues, the only difference being
that then they were in arms, whereas, now, they have laid them aside.
After much controversy and wrangling, these factions would presently
proceed to bloodshed, to pulling down houses, plundering property, and
all the other violent courses usual in divided cities. The Florentines,
with whom it lay to compose these feuds, strove for a long time to do
so by using the third of the methods mentioned; but when this only led
to increased tumult and disorder, losing patience, they decided to try
the second method and get rid of the ringleaders of both factions by
imprisoning some and banishing others. In this way a sort of settlement
was arrived at, which continues in operation up to the present hour.
There can be no question, however, that the first of the methods named
would have been the surest. But because extreme measures have in them
an element of greatness and nobility, a weak republic, so far from
knowing how to use this first method, can with difficulty be brought to
employ even the second. This, as I said at the beginning, is the kind
of blunder made by the princes of our times when they have to decide on
matters of moment, from their not considering how those men acted who
in ancient days had to determine under like conditions. For the
weakness of the present race of men (the result of their enfeebling
education and their ignorance of affairs), makes them regard the
methods followed by the ancients as partly inhuman and partly
impracticable. Accordingly, they have their own newfangled ways of
looking at things, wholly at variance with the true, as when the sages
of our city, some time since, pronounced that _Pistoja was to be held
by feuds and Pisa by fortresses_, not perceiving how useless each of
these methods is in itself.

Having spoken of fortresses already at some length, I shall not further
refer to them here, but shall consider the futility of trying to hold
subject cities by keeping them divided. In the first place, it is
impossible for the ruling power, whether prince or republic, to be
friends with both factions. For wherever there is division, it is human
nature to take a side, and to favour one party more than another. But
if one party in a subject city be unfriendly to you, the consequence
will be that you will lose that city so soon as you are involved in
war, since it is impossible for you to hold a city where you have
enemies both within and without. Should the ruling power be a republic,
there is nothing so likely to corrupt its citizens and sow dissension
among them, as having to control a divided city. For as each faction in
that city will seek support and endeavour to make friends in a variety
of corrupt ways, two very serious evils will result: first, that the
governed city will never be contented with its governors, since there
can be no good government where you often change its form, adapting
yourself to the humours now of one party and now of another; and next,
that the factious spirit of the subject city is certain to infect your
own republic. To which Biondo testifies, when, in speaking of the
citizens of Florence and Pistoja, he says, “_In seeking to unite
Pistoja the Florentines themselves fell out_.”[15]

 [15] _Flav. Blondri Hist._, dec. ii. lib. 9. Basle ed. 1559, p. 337


It is easy, therefore, to understand how much mischief attends on such
divisions. In the year 1501, when we lost Arezzo, and when all the Val
di Tevere and Val di Chiana were occupied by the Vitelli and by Duke
Valentino, a certain M. de Lant was sent by the King of France to cause
the whole of the lost towns to be restored to the Florentines; who
finding in all these towns men who came to him claiming to be of the
party of the _Marzocco_,[16] greatly blamed this distinction,
observing, that if in France any of the king’s subjects were to say
that he was of the king’s party, he would be punished; since the
expression would imply that there was a party hostile to the king,
whereas it was his majesty’s desire that all his subjects should be his
friends and live united without any distinction of party. But all these
mistaken methods and opinions originate in the weakness of rulers, who,
seeing that they cannot hold their States by their own strength and
valour, have recourse to like devices; which, if now and then in
tranquil times they prove of some slight assistance to them, in times
of danger are shown to be worthless.

CHAPTER XXVIII.—_That a Republic must keep an eye on what its Citizens
are about; since often the seeds of a Tyranny lie hidden under a
semblance of generous deeds._


The granaries of Rome not sufficing to meet a famine with which the
city was visited, a certain Spurius Melius, a very wealthy citizen for
these days, privately laid in a supply of corn wherewith to feed the
people at his own expense; gaining thereby such general favour with the
commons, that the senate, apprehending that his bounty might have
dangerous consequences, in order to crush him before he grew too
powerful, appointed a dictator to deal with him and caused him to be
put to death.

Here we have to note that actions which seem good in themselves and
unlikely to occasion harm to any one, very often become hurtful, nay,
unless corrected in time, most dangerous for a republic. And to treat
the matter with greater fulness, I say, that while a republic can never
maintain itself long, or manage its affairs to advantage, without
citizens of good reputation, on the other hand the credit enjoyed by
particular citizens often leads to the establishment of a tyranny. For
which reasons, and that things may take a safe course, it should be so
arranged that a citizen shall have credit only for such behaviour as
benefits, and not for such as injures the State and its liberties. We
must therefore examine by what ways credit is acquired. These, briefly,
are two, public or secret. Public, when a citizen gains a great name by
advising well or by acting still better for the common advantage. To
credit of this sort we should open a wide door, holding out rewards
both for good counsels and for good actions, so that he who renders
such services may be at once honoured and satisfied. Reputation
acquired honestly and openly by such means as these can never be
dangerous. But credit acquired by secret practices, which is the other
method spoken of, is most perilous and prejudicial. Of such secret
practices may be instanced, acts of kindness done to this or the other
citizen in lending him money, in assisting him to marry his daughters,
in defending him against the magistrates, and in conferring such other
private favours as gain men devoted adherents, and encourage them after
they have obtained such support, to corrupt the institutions of the
State and to violate its laws.

A well-governed republic, therefore, ought, as I have said, to throw
wide the door to all who seek public favour by open courses, and to
close it against any who would ingratiate themselves by underhand
means. And this we find was done in Rome. For the Roman republic, as a
reward to any citizen who served it well, ordained triumphs and all the
other honours which it had to bestow; while against those who sought to
aggrandize themselves by secret intrigues, it ordained accusations and
impeachment; and when, from the people being blinded by a false show of
benevolence, these proved insufficient, it provided for a dictator, who
with regal authority might bring to bounds any who had strayed beyond
them, as instanced in the case of Spurius Melius. And if conduct like
his be ever suffered to pass unchastised, it may well be the ruin of a
republic, for men when they have such examples set them are not easily
led back into the right path.




CHAPTER XXIX.—_That the Faults of a People are due to its Prince._


Let no prince complain of the faults committed by a people under his
control; since these must be ascribed either to his negligence, or to
his being himself blemished by similar defects. And were any one to
consider what peoples in our own times have been most given to robbery
and other like offences, he would find that they have only copied their
rulers, who have themselves been of a like nature. Romagna, before
those lords who ruled it were driven out by Pope Alexander VI., was a
nursery of all the worst crimes, the slightest occasion giving rise to
wholesale rapine and murder. This resulted from the wickedness of these
lords, and not, as they asserted, from the evil disposition of their
subjects. For these princes being poor, yet choosing to live as though
they were rich, were forced to resort to cruelties innumerable and
practised in divers ways; and among other shameful devices contrived by
them to extort money, they would pass laws prohibiting certain acts,
and then be the first to give occasion for breaking them; nor would
they chastise offenders until they saw many involved in the same
offence; when they fell to punishing, not from any zeal for the laws
which they had made, but out of greed to realize the penalty. Whence
flowed many mischiefs, and more particularly this, that the people
being impoverished, but not corrected, sought to make good their
injuries at the expense of others weaker than themselves. And thus
there sprang up all those evils spoken of above, whereof the prince is
the true cause.

The truth of what I say is confirmed by Titus Livius where he relates
how the Roman envoys, who were conveying the spoils of the Veientines
as an offering to Apollo, were seized and brought on shore by the
corsairs of the Lipari islands in Sicily; when Timasitheus, the prince
of these islands, on learning the nature of the offering, its
destination, and by whom sent, though himself of Lipari, behaved as a
Roman might, showing his people what sacrilege it would be to intercept
such a gift, and speaking to such purpose that by general consent the
envoys were suffered to proceed upon their voyage, taking all their
possessions with them. With reference to which incident the historian
observes: “_The multitude, who always take their colour from their
ruler, were filled by Timasitheus with a religious awe._” And to like
purport we find it said by Lorenzo de’ Medici:—

“A prince’s acts his people imitate;
For on their lord the eyes of all men wait.”[17]

CHAPTER XXX.—_That a Citizen who seeks by his personal influence to
render signal service to his Country, must first stand clear of Envy.
How a City should prepare for its defence on the approach of an Enemy._


When the Roman senate learned that all Etruria was assembled in arms to
march against Rome, and that the Latins and Hernicians, who before had
been the friends of the Romans, had ranged themselves with the
Volscians the ancient enemies of the Roman name, they foresaw that a
perilous contest awaited them. But because Camillus was at that time
tribune with consular authority they thought all might be managed
without the appointment of a dictator, provided the other tribunes, his
colleagues would agree to his assuming the sole direction of affairs.
This they willingly did; “_nor_,” says Titus Livius, “_did they account
anything as taken from their own dignity which was added to his._”

On receiving their promise of obedience, Camillus gave orders that
three armies should be enrolled. Of the first, which was to be directed
against the Etruscans, he himself assumed command. The command of the
second, which he meant to remain near Rome and meet any movement of the
Latins and Hernicians, he gave to Quintius Servilius. The third army,
which he designed for the protection of the city, and the defence of
the gates and Curia, he entrusted to Lucius Quintius. And he further
directed, that Horatius, one of his colleagues, should furnish supplies
of arms, and corn, and of all else needful in time of war. Finally he
put forward his colleague Cornelius to preside in the senate and public
council, that from day to day he might advise what should be done. For
in those times these tribunes were ready either to command or obey as
the welfare of their country might require.

We may gather from this passage how a brave and prudent man should act,
how much good he may effect, and how serviceable he may be to his
country, when by the force of his character and worth he succeeds in
extinguishing envy. For this often disables men from acting to the best
advantage, not permitting them to obtain that authority which it is
essential they should have in matters of importance. Now, envy may be
extinguished in one or other of two ways: first, by the approach of
some flagrant danger, whereby seeing themselves like to be overwhelmed,
all forego their own private ambition and lend a willing obedience to
him who counts on his valour to rescue them. As in the case of
Camillas, who from having given many proofs of surpassing ability, and
from having been three times dictator and always exercised the office
for the public good and not for his private advantage, had brought men
to fear nothing from his advancement; while his fame and reputation
made it no shame for them to recognize him as their superior. Wisely,
therefore, does Titus Livius use concerning him the words which I have
cited.

The other way in which envy may be extinguished, is by the death,
whether by violence or in the ordinary course of nature, of those who
have been your rivals in the pursuit of fame or power, and who seeing
you better esteemed than themselves, could never acquiesce in your
superiority or put up with it in patience. For when these men have been
brought up in a corrupt city, where their training is little likely to
improve them, nothing that can happen will induce them to withdraw
their pretensions; nay, to have their own way and satisfy their
perverse humour, they will be content to look on while their country is
ruined. For envy such as this there is no cure save by the death of
those of whom it has taken possession. And when fortune so befriends a
great man that his rivals are removed from his path by a natural death,
his glory is established without scandal or offence, since he is then
able to display his great qualities unhindered. But when fortune is not
thus propitious to him, he must contrive other means to rid himself of
rivals, and must do so successfully before he can accomplish anything.
Any one who reads with intelligence the lessons of Holy Writ, will
remember how Moses, to give effect to his laws and ordinances, was
constrained to put to death an endless number of those who out of mere
envy withstood his designs. The necessity of this course was well
understood by the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, and by the Gonfalonier
Piero Soderini. But the former could not comply with it, because, as a
friar, he himself lacked the needful authority; while those of his
followers who might have exercised that authority, did not rightly
comprehend his teaching. This, however, was no fault of his; for his
sermons are full of invectives and attacks against “_the wise of this
world_,” that being the name he gave to envious rivals and to all who
opposed his reforms. As for Piero Soderini, he was possessed by the
belief that in time and with favourable fortune he could allay envy by
gentleness-and by benefits conferred on particular men; for as he was
still in the prime of life, and in the fresh enjoyment of that
good-will which his character and opinions had gained for him, he
thought to get the better of all who out of jealousy opposed him,
without giving occasion for tumult, violence, or disorder; not knowing
how time stays not, worth suffices not, fortune shifts, and malice will
not be won over by any benefit Wherefore, because they could not or
knew not how to vanquish this envy, the two whom I have named came to
their downfall.

Another point to be noted in the passage we are considering, is the
careful provision made by Camillus for the safety of Rome both within
and without the city. And, truly, not without reason do wise
historians, like our author, set forth certain events with much
minuteness and detail, to the end that those who come after may learn
how to protect themselves in like dangers. Further, we have to note
that there is no more hazardous or less useful defence than one
conducted without method or system. This is shown in Camillus causing a
third army to be enrolled that it might be left in Rome for the
protection of the city. Many persons, doubtless, both then and now,
would esteem this precaution superfluous, thinking that as the Romans
were a warlike people and constantly under arms, there could be no
occasion for a special levy, and that it was time enough to arm when
the need came. But Camillus, and any other equally prudent captain
would be of the same mind, judged otherwise, not permitting the
multitude to take up arms unless they were to be bound by the rules and
discipline of military service. Let him, therefore, who is called on to
defend a city, taking example by Camillus, before all things avoid
placing arms in the hands of an undisciplined multitude, but first of
all select and enroll those whom he proposes to arm, so that they may
be wholly governed by him as to where they shall assemble and whither
they shall march; and then let him direct those who are not enrolled,
to abide every man in his own house for its defence. Whosoever observes
this method in a city which is attacked, will be able to defend it with
ease; but whosoever disregards it, and follows not the example of
Camillus, shall never succeed.




CHAPTER XXXI.—_That strong Republics and valiant Men preserve through
every change the same Spirit and Bearing._


Among other high sayings which our historian ascribes to Camillus, as
showing of what stuff a truly great man should be made, he puts in his
mouth the words, “_My courage came not with my dictatorship nor went
with my exile;_” for by these words we are taught that a great man is
constantly the same through all vicissitudes of Fortune; so that
although she change, now exalting, now depressing, he remains
unchanged, and retains always a mind so unmoved, and in such complete
accordance with his nature as declares to all that over him Fortune has
no dominion.

Very different is the behaviour of those weak-minded mortals who,
puffed up and intoxicated with their success, ascribe all their
felicity to virtues which they never knew, and thus grow hateful and
insupportable to all around them. Whence also the changes in their
fortunes. For whenever they have to look adversity in the face, they
suddenly pass to the other extreme, becoming abject and base. And thus
it happens that feeble-minded princes, when they fall into
difficulties, think rather of flight than of defence, because, having
made bad use of their prosperity, they are wholly unprepared to defend
themselves.

The same merits and defects which I say are found in individual men,
are likewise found in republics, whereof we have example in the case of
Rome and of Venice. For no reverse of fortune ever broke the spirit of
the Roman people, nor did any success ever unduly elate them; as we see
plainly after their defeat at Cannæ, and after the victory they had
over Antiochus. For the defeat at Cannæ, although most momentous, being
the third they had met with, no whit daunted them; so that they
continued to send forth armies, refused to ransom prisoners as contrary
to their custom, and despatched no envoy to Hannibal or to Carthage to
sue for peace; but without ever looking back on past humiliations,
thought always of war, though in such straits for soldiers that they
had to arm their old men and slaves. Which facts being made known to
Hanno the Carthaginian, he, as I have already related, warned the
Carthaginian senate not to lay too much stress upon their victory.
Here, therefore, we see that in times of adversity the Romans were
neither cast down nor dismayed. On the other hand, no prosperity ever
made them arrogant. Before fighting the battle wherein he was finally
routed, Antiochus sent messengers to Scipio to treat for an accord;
when Scipio offered peace on condition that he withdrew at once into
Syria, leaving all his other dominions to be dealt with by the Romans
as they thought fit. Antiochus refusing these terms, fought and was
defeated, and again sent envoys to Scipio, enjoining them to accept
whatever conditions the victor might be pleased to impose. But Scipio
proposed no different terms from those he had offered before saying
that “_the Romans, as they lost not heart on defeat, so waxed not
insolent with success._”

The contrary of all this is seen in the behaviour of the Venetians, who
thinking their good fortune due to valour of which they were devoid, in
their pride addressed the French king as “Son of St. Mark;” and making
no account of the Church, and no longer restricting their ambition to
the limits of Italy, came to dream of founding an empire like the
Roman. But afterwards, when their good fortune deserted them, and they
met at Vailà a half-defeat at the hands of the French king, they lost
their whole dominions, not altogether from revolt, but mainly by a base
and abject surrender to the Pope and the King of Spain. Nay, so low did
they stoop as to send ambassadors to the Emperor offering to become his
tributaries, and to write letters to the Pope, full of submission and
servility, in order to move his compassion. To such abasement were they
brought in four days’ time by what was in reality only a half-defeat.
For on their flight after the battle of Vailà only about a half of
their forces were engaged, and one of their two provedditori escaped to
Verona with five and twenty thousand men, horse and foot. So that had
there been a spark of valour in Venice, or any soundness in her
military system, she might easily have renewed her armies, and again
confronting fortune have stood prepared either to conquer, or, if she
must fall, to fall more gloriously; and at any rate might have obtained
for herself more honourable terms. But a pusillanimous spirit,
occasioned by the defects of her ordinances in so far as they relate to
war, caused her to lose at once her courage and her dominions. And so
will it always happen with those who behave like the Venetians. For
when men grow insolent in good fortune, and abject inn evil, the fault
lies in themselves and in the character of their training, which, when
slight and frivolous, assimilates them to itself; but when otherwise,
makes them of another temper, and giving them better acquaintance with
the world, causes them to be less disheartened by misfortunes and less
elated by success.

And while this is true of individual men, it holds good also of a
concourse of men living together in one republic, who will arrive at
that measure of perfection which the institutions of their State
permit. And although I have already said on another occasion that a
good militia is the foundation of all States, and where that is wanting
there can neither be good laws, nor aught else that is good, it seems
to me not superfluous to say the same again; because in reading this
history of Titus Livius the necessity of such a foundation is made
apparent in every page. It is likewise shown that no army can be good
unless it be thoroughly trained and exercised, and that this can only
be the case with an army raised from your own subjects. For as a State
is not and cannot always be at war, you must have opportunity to train
your army in times of peace; but this, having regard to the cost, you
can only have in respect of your own subjects.

When Camillus, as already related, went forth to meet the Etruscans,
his soldiers on seeing the great army of their enemy, were filled with
fear, thinking themselves too to withstand its onset. This untoward
disposition being reported to Camillus, he showed himself to his men
and by visiting their tents, and conversing with this and the other
among them, was able to remove their misgivings; and, finally, without
other word of command, he bade them “_each do his part as he had
learned and been accustomed_.” Now, any one who well considers the
methods followed by Camillus, and the words spoken by him to encourage
his soldiers to face their enemy, will perceive that these words and
methods could never have been used with an army which had not been
trained and disciplined in time of peace as well as of war. For no
captain can trust to untrained soldiers or look for good service at
their hands; nay, though he were another Hannibal, with such troops his
defeat were certain. For, as a captain cannot be present everywhere
while a battle is being fought, unless he have taken all measures
beforehand to render his men of the same temper as himself, and have
made sure that they perfectly understand his orders and arrangements,
he will inevitably be destroyed.

When a city therefore is armed and trained as Rome was, and when its
citizens have daily opportunity, both singly and together, to make
trial of their valour and learn what fortune can effect, it will always
happen, that at all times, and whether circumstances be adverse or
favourable, they will remain of unaltered courage and preserve the same
noble bearing. But when its citizens are unpractised in arms, and trust
not to their own valour but wholly to the arbitration of Fortune, they
will change their temper as she changes, and offer always the same
example of behaviour as was given by the Venetians.




CHAPTER XXXII.—_Of the methods which some have used to make Peace
impossible_.


The towns of Cære and Velitræ, two of her own colonies, revolted from
Rome in expectation of being protected by the Latins. But the Latins
being routed and all hopes of help from that quarter at an end, many of
the townsmen recommended that envoys should be sent to Rome to make
their peace with the senate. This proposal, however, was defeated by
those who had been the prime movers of the revolt, who, fearing that
the whole punishment might fall on their heads, to put a stop to any
talk of an adjustment, incited the multitude to take up arms and make a
foray into the Roman territory.

And, in truth, when it is desired that a prince or people should banish
from their minds every thought of reconciliation, there is no surer or
more effectual plan than to incite them to inflict grave wrong on him
with whom you would not have them be reconciled; for, then, the fear of
that punishment which they will seem to themselves to have deserved,
will always keep them apart. At the close of the first war waged by the
Romans against Carthage, the soldiers who had served under the
Carthaginians in Sardinia and Sicily, upon peace being proclaimed,
returned to Africa; where, being dissatisfied with their pay, they
mutinied against the Carthaginians, and choosing two of their number,
Mato and Spendio, to be their leaders, seized and sacked many towns
subject to Carthage. The Carthaginians, being loath to use force until
they had tried all other methods for bringing them to reason, sent
Hasdrubal, their fellow-citizen, to mediate with them, thinking that
from formerly having commanded them he might be able to exercise some
influence over them. But on his arrival, Spendio and Mato, to
extinguish any hope these mutineers might have had of making peace with
Carthage, and so leave them no alternative but war, persuaded them that
their best course was to put Hasdrubal, with all the other Carthaginian
citizens whom they had taken prisoners, to death. Whereupon, they not
only put them to death, but first subjected them to an infinity of
tortures; crowning their wickedness by a proclamation to the effect
that every Carthaginian who might thereafter fall into their hands
should meet a like fate. This advice, therefore, and its consummation
had the effect of rendering these mutineers relentless and inveterate
in their hostility to the Carthaginians.




CHAPTER XXXIII.—_That to insure victory in battle you must inspire your
Men with confidence in one another and in you._


To insure an army being victorious in battle you must inspire it with
the conviction that it is certain to prevail. The causes which give it
this confidence are its being well armed and disciplined, and the
soldiers knowing one another. These conditions are only to be found
united in soldiers born and bred in the same country.

It is likewise essential that the army should think so well of its
captain as to trust implicitly to his prudence; which it will always do
if it see him careful of its welfare, attentive to discipline, brave in
battle, and otherwise supporting well and honourably the dignity of his
position. These conditions he fulfils when, while punishing faults, he
does not needlessly harass his men, keeps his word with them, shows
them that the path to victory is easy, and conceals from them, or makes
light of things which seen from a distance might appear to threaten
danger. The observance of these precautions will give an army great
confidence, and such confidence leads to victory.

This confidence the Romans were wont to inspire in the minds of their
soldiers by the aid of religion; and accordingly their consuls were
appointed, their armies were enrolled, their soldiers marched forth,
and their battles were begun, only when the auguries and auspices were
favourable; and without attending to all these observances no prudent
captain would ever engage in combat; knowing that unless his soldiers
were first assured that the gods were on their side, he might readily
suffer defeat. But if any consul or other leader ever joined battle
contrary to the auspices, the Romans would punish him, as they did
Claudius Pulcher.

The truth of what I affirm is plainly seen from the whole course of the
Roman history, but is more particularly established by the words which
Livius puts into the mouth of Appius Claudius, who, when complaining to
the people of the insolence of the tribunes, and taxing them with
having caused the corruption of the auspices and other rites of
religion, is made to say, “_And now they would strip even religion of
its authority. For what matters it, they will tell you, that the fowls
refuse to peck, or come slowly from the coop, or that a cock has
crowed? These are small matters doubtless; but it was by not contemning
such small matters as these, that our forefathers built up this great
republic._” And, indeed, in these small matters lies a power which
keeps men united and of good courage, which is of itself the chief
condition of success.

But the observances of religion must be accompanied by valour, for
otherwise they can nothing avail. The men of Praneste, leading forth
their army against the Romans, took up their position near the river
Allia, on the very spot where the Romans had been routed by the Gauls,
selecting this ground that it might inspire their own side with
confidence, and dishearten their enemies with the unhappy memories
which it recalled But although, for the reasons already noted, this was
a course which promised success, the result nevertheless showed that
true valour is not to be daunted by trifling disadvantages. And this
the historian well expresses by the words he puts in the mouth of the
dictator as spoken to his master of the knights “_See how these
fellows, in encamping on the banks of the Allia, have chosen their
ground in reliance upon fortune. Do you, therefore, relying on
discipline and valour, fall upon then centre._” For true valour, tight
discipline, and the feeling of security gained by repeated victories,
are not to be counteracted by things of no real moment, dismayed by
empty terrors, or quelled by a solitary mishap. As was well seen when
the two Manlii, being consuls in command against the Volscians, rashly
allowed a part of their army to go out foraging, and both those who
went out and those who stayed behind found themselves attacked at the
same moment For from this danger they were saved by the courage of the
soldiers, and not by the foresight of the consuls. With regard to which
occurrence Titus Livius observes, “_Even without a leader the steadfast
valour of the soldiers was maintained._”

Here I must not omit to notice the device practised by Fabius to give
his army confidence, when he led it for the first time into Etruria.
For judging such encouragement to be especially needed by his men,
since they were entering an unknown country to encounter a new foe, he
addressed them before they joined battle, and, after reciting many
reasons for expecting a victory, told them, that “_he could have
mentioned other favourable circumstances making victory certain, had it
not been dangerous to disclose them._” And as this device was
dexterously used it merits imitation.




CHAPTER XXXIV.—_By what reports, rumours, or surmises the Citizens of a
Republic are led to favour a Fellow-citizen: and-whether the
Magistracies are bestowed with better judgment by a People or by a
Prince._


I have elsewhere related how Titus Manlius, afterwards named Torquatus,
rescued his father from the charge laid against him by Marcus
Pomponius, tribune of the people. And though the means he took to
effect this were somewhat violent and irregular, so pleasing to
everyone were his filial piety and affection, that not only did he
escape rebuke, but when military tribunes had to be appointed his name
was second on the list of those chosen. To explain his good fortune, it
will, I think, be useful to consider what are the methods followed by
the citizens of a republic in estimating the character of those on whom
they bestow honours, so as to see whether what I have already said on
this head be true, namely, that a people is more discriminating in
awarding honours than a prince.

I say, then, that in conferring honours and offices, the people, when
it has no knowledge of a man from his public career, follows the
estimate given of him by the general voice, and by common report; or
else is guided by some prepossession or preconceived opinion which it
has adopted concerning him. Such impressions are formed either from
consideration of a man’s descent (it being assumed, until the contrary
appears, that where his ancestors have been great and distinguished
citizens their descendant will resemble them), or else from regard to
his manners and habits; and nothing can be more in his favour than that
he frequents the company of the grave and virtuous, and such as are
generally reputed wise. For as we can have no better clue to a man’s
character than the company he keeps, he who frequents worthy company
deservedly obtains a good name, since there can hardly fail to be some
similarity between himself and his associates. Sometimes, however, the
popular estimate of a man is founded on some remarkable and noteworthy
action, though not of public moment, in which he has acquitted himself
well. And of all the three causes which create a prepossession in a
man’s favour, none is so effectual as this last. For the presumption
that he will resemble his ancestors and kinsmen is so often misleading,
that men are slow to trust and quick to discard it, unless confirmed by
the personal worth of him of whom they are judging.

The criterion of character afforded by a man’s manners and conversation
is a safer guide than the presumption of inherited excellence, but is
far inferior to that afforded by his actions; for until he has given
actual proof of his worth, his credit is built on mere opinion, which
may readily change. But this third mode of judging, which originates in
and rests upon his actions, at once gives him a name which can only be
destroyed by his afterwards doing many actions of a contrary nature.
Those therefore who live in a republic should conform to this third
criterion, and endeavour, as did many of the Roman youth, to make their
start in life with some extraordinary achievement, either by promoting
a law conducive to the general well-being, or by accusing some powerful
citizen as a transgressor of the laws, or by performing some similar
new and notable action which cannot fail to be much spoken of.

Actions like this are necessary not only to lay a foundation for your
fame, but also to maintain and extend it. To which end, they must
continually be renewed, as we find done by Titus Manlius throughout the
whole course of his life. For after winning his earliest renown by his
bold and singular defence of his father, when some years had passed he
fought his famous duel with the Gaul, from whom, when he had slain him,
he took the twisted golden collar which gave him the name of Torquatus.
Nor was this the last of his remarkable actions, for at a later period,
when he was of ripe years, he caused his own son to be put to death,
because he had fought without leave, although successfully. Which three
actions gained for him at the time a greater name, and have made him
more renowned through after ages than all his triumphs and victories,
though of these he had as large a share as fell to the lot of any other
Roman. The explanation of which is, that while in his victories Manlius
had many who resembled him, in these particular actions he stood almost
or entirely alone.

So, too, with the elder Scipio, all whose victories together did not
obtain for him so much reputation, as did his rescue, while he was yet
young, of his father at the Ticino, and his undaunted bearing after the
rout at Cannæ, when with his naked sword he constrained a number of the
Roman youth to swear never to abandon their country, as some among them
had before been minded to do. It was these two actions, therefore,
which laid the foundation of his future fame and paved the way for his
triumphs in Spain and Africa. And the fair esteem in which men held
him, was still further heightened when in Spain he restored a daughter
to her father, a wife to her husband.

Nor is it only the citizen who seeks reputation as leading to civil
honours, who must act in this way; the prince who would maintain his
credit in his princedom must do likewise; since nothing helps so much
to make a prince esteemed as to give signal proofs of his worth,
whether by words or by deeds which tend to promote the public good, and
show him to be so magnanimous, generous, and just, that he may well
pass into a proverb among his subjects. But to return to the point
whence I digressed, I say that if a people, when they first confer
honours on a fellow-citizen, rest their judgment on any one of the
three circumstances above-mentioned, they build on a reasonable
foundation; but, when many instances of noble conduct have made a man
favourably known, that the foundation is still better, since then there
is hardly room for mistake. I speak merely of those honours which are
bestowed on a man at the outset of his career, before he has come to be
known by continued proof, or is found to have passed from one kind of
conduct to another and dissimilar kind, and I maintain that in such
cases, so far as erroneous judgments or corrupt motives are concerned,
a people will always commit fewer mistakes than a prince.

But since a people may happen to be deceived as regards the character,
reputation, and actions of a man, thinking them better or greater than
in truth they are, an error a prince is less likely to fall into from
his being informed and warned by his advisers, in order that the people
may not lack similar advice, wise founders of republics have provided,
that when the highest dignities of the State, to which it would be
dangerous to appoint incapable men, have to be filled up, and it
appears that some incapable man is the object of the popular choice, it
shall be lawful and accounted honourable for any citizen to declare in
the public assemblies the defects of the favoured candidate, that the
people, being made acquainted therewith, may be better able to judge of
his fitness. That this was the practice in Rome we have proof in the
speech made by Fabius Maximus to the people during the second Punic
war, when in the appointment of consuls public favour leaned towards
Titus Ottacilius. For Fabius judging him unequal to the duties of the
consulship at such a crisis, spoke against him and pointed out his
insufficiency, and so prevented his appointment, turning the popular
favour towards another who deserved it more.

In the choice of its magistrates, therefore, a people judges of those
among whom it has to choose, in accordance with the surest indications
it can get; and when it can be advised as princes are, makes fewer
mistakes than they. But the citizen who would make a beginning by
gaining the good-will of the people, must, to obtain it, perform, like
Titus Manlius, some noteworthy action.




CHAPTER XXXV.—_Of the Danger incurred in being the first to recommend
new Measures; and that the more unusual the Measures the greater the
Danger_.


How perilous a thing it is to put one’s self at the head of changes
whereby many are affected, how difficult to guide and bring them to
perfection, and when perfected to maintain them, were too wide and
arduous a subject to be treated here. Wherefore I reserve it for a
fitter occasion, and shall now speak only of those dangers which are
incurred by the citizens of a republic or by the counsellors of a
prince in being the first to promote some grave and important measure
in such manner that the whole responsibility attending it rests with
them. For as men judge of things by their results, any evil which
ensues from such measures will be imputed to their author. And although
if good ensue he will be applauded, nevertheless in matters of this
kind, what a man may gain is as nothing to what he may lose.

Selim, the present sultan, or Grand Turk as he is called, being in
readiness, as some who come from his country relate, to set forth on an
expedition against Egypt and Syria, was urged by one of his bashaws
whom he had stationed on the confines of Persia, to make war upon the
Sofi. In compliance with which advice he went on this new enterprise
with a vast army. But coming to a great plain, wherein were many
deserts and few streams, and encountering the same difficulties as in
ancient times had proved the ruin of many Roman armies, he suffered so
much from pestilence and famine, that, although victorious in battle,
he lost a great part of his men. This so enraged him against the bashaw
on whose advice he had acted, that he forthwith put him to death.

In like manner, we read of many citizens who having strenuously
promoted various measures were banished when these turned out badly.
Certain citizens of Rome, for instance, were very active in forwarding
a law allowing the appointment of a plebeian to be consul. This law
passing, it so happened that the first plebeian consul who went forth
with the armies was routed; and had it not been that the party in whose
behalf the law was made was extremely powerful, its promoters would
have fared badly. It is plain therefore that the counsellors whether of
a republic or of a prince stand in this dilemma, that if they do not
conscientiously advise whatsoever they think advantageous for their
city or prince, they fail in their duty; if they do advise it, they
risk their places and their lives; all men being subject to this
infirmity of judging advice by the event.

When I consider in what way this reproach or this danger may best be
escaped, I find no other remedy to recommend than that in giving advice
you proceed discreetly not identifying yourself in a special manner
with the measure you would see carried out, but offering your opinion
without heat, and supporting it temperately and modestly, so that if
the prince or city follow it, they shall do so of their own good-will,
and not seem to be dragged into it by your importunity. When you act
thus, neither prince nor people can reasonably bear you a grudge in
respect of the advice given by you, since that advice was not adopted
contrary to the general opinion. For your danger lies in many having
opposed you, who afterwards, should your advice prove hurtful, combine
to ruin you. And although in taking this course you fall short of the
glory which is earned by him who stands alone against many in urging
some measure which succeeds, you have nevertheless two advantages to
make up for it: first, that you escape danger; and second, that when
you have temperately stated your views, and when, in consequence of
opposition, your advice has not been taken, should other counsels
prevail and mischief come of them, your credit will be vastly enhanced.
And although credit gained at the cost of misfortune to your prince or
city cannot be matter of rejoicing, still it is something to be taken
into account.

On this head, then, I know of no other advice to offer. For that you
should be silent and express no opinion at all, were a course hurtful
for your prince or city, and which would not absolve you from danger,
since you would soon grow to be suspected, when it might fare with you
as with the friend of Perseus the Macedonian king. For Perseus being
defeated by Paulus Emilius, and making his escape with a few
companions, it happened that one of them, in reviewing the past, began
to point out to the king many mistakes which he had made and which had
been his ruin. Whereupon Perseus turning upon him said, “_Traitor, hast
thou waited till now when there is no remedy to tell me these things_?”
and so saying, slew him with his own hand. Such was the penalty
incurred by one who was silent when he should have spoken, and who
spoke when he should have been silent; and who found no escape from
danger in having refrained from giving advice. Wherefore, I believe,
that the course which I have recommended should be observed and
followed.




CHAPTER XXXVI.—_Why it has been and still may be affirmed of the Gauls,
that at the beginning of a fray they are more than Men, but afterwards
less than Women_.


The bravery of the Gaul who on the banks of the Anio challenged any
among the Romans to fight with him, and the combat that thereupon
ensued between him and Titus Manlius, remind me of what Titus Livius
oftener than once observes in his history, that “_at the beginning of a
fray the Gauls are more than men, but ere it is ended show themselves
less than women_.”

Touching the cause of this, many are content to believe that such is
their nature, which, indeed, I take to be true; but we are not,
therefore, to assume that the natural temper which makes them brave at
the outset, may not be so trained and regulated as to keep them brave
to the end. And, to prove this, I say, that armies are of three kinds.
In one of these you have discipline with bravery and valour as its
consequence. Such was the Roman army, which is shown by all historians
to have maintained excellent discipline as the result of constant
military training. And because in a well-disciplined army none must do
anything save by rule, we find that in the Roman army, from which as it
conquered the world all others should take example, none either eat, or
slept, or bought, or sold, or did anything else, whether in his
military or in his private capacity, without orders from the consul.
Those armies which do otherwise are not true armies, and if ever they
have any success, it is owing to the fury and impetuosity of their
onset and not to trained and steady valour. But of this impetuosity and
fury, trained valour, when occasion requires, will make use; nor will
any danger daunt it or cause it to lose heart, its courage being kept
alive by its discipline, and its confidence fed by the hope of victory
which never fails it while that discipline is maintained.

But the contrary happens with armies of the second sort, those, namely,
which have impetuosity without discipline, as was the case with the
Gauls whose courage in a protracted conflict gradually wore away; so
that unless they succeeded in their first attack, the impetuosity to
which they trusted, having no support from disciplined valour, soon
cooled; when, as they had nothing else to depend on, their efforts
ceased. The Romans, on the other hand, being less disquieted in danger
by reason of their perfect discipline, and never losing hope, fought
steadily and stubbornly to the last, and with the same courage at the
end as at the outset; nay, growing heated by the conflict, only became
the fiercer the longer it was continued.

In armies of the third sort both natural spirit and trained valour are
wanting; and to this class belong the Italian armies of our own times,
of which it may be affirmed that they are absolutely worthless, never
obtaining a victory, save when, by some accident, the enemy they
encounter takes to flight. But since we have daily proofs of this
absence of valour, it were needless to set forth particular instances
of it.

That all, however, may know on the testimony of Titus Livius what
methods a good army should take, and what are taken by a bad army, I
shall cite the words he represents Papirius Cursor to have used when
urging that Fabius, his master of the knights, should be punished for
disobedience, and denouncing the consequences which would ensue were he
absolved, saying:—“_Let neither God nor man be held in reverence; let
the orders of captains and the Divine auspices be alike disregarded;
let a vagrant soldiery range without leave through the country of
friend or foe; reckless of their military oath, let them disband at
their pleasure; let them forsake their deserted standards, and neither
rally nor disperse at the word of command; let them fight when they
choose, by day or by night, with or without advantage of ground, with
or without the bidding of their leader, neither maintaining their ranks
_nor observing the order of battle; and let our armies, from being a
solemn and consecrated company, grow to resemble some dark and
fortuitous gathering of cut-throats._” With this passage before us, it
is easy to pronounce whether the armies of our times be “_a dark and
fortuitous gathering_,” or “_a solemn and consecrated company_;” nay,
how far they fall short of anything worthy to be called an army,
possessing neither the impetuous but disciplined valour of the Romans,
nor even the mere undisciplined impetuosity of the Gauls.




CHAPTER XXXVII.—_Whether a general engagement should be preceded by
skirmishes; and how, avoiding these, we may get knowledge of a new
Enemy._


Besides all the other difficulties which hinder men from bringing
anything to its utmost perfection, it appears, as I have already
observed, that in close vicinity to every good is found also an evil,
so apt to grow up along with it that it is hardly possible to have the
one without accepting the other. This we see in all human affairs, and
the result is, that unless fortune aid us to overcome this natural and
common disadvantage, we never arrive at any excellence. I am reminded
of this by the combat between Titus Manlius and the Gaul, concerning
which Livius writes that it “_determined the issue of the entire war;
since the Gauls, abandoning their camp, hastily withdrew to the country
about Tivoli, whence they presently passed into Campania._”

It may be said, therefore, on the one hand, that a prudent captain
ought absolutely to refrain from all those operations which, while of
trifling moment in themselves, may possibly produce an ill effect on
his army. Now, to engage in a combat wherein you risk your whole
fortunes without putting forth your entire strength, is, as I observed
before, when condemning the defence of a country by guarding its
defiles, an utterly foolhardy course. On the other hand, it is to be
said that a prudent captain, when he has to meet a new and redoubtable
adversary, ought, before coming to a general engagement, to accustom
his men by skirmishes and passages of arms, to the quality of their
enemy; that they may learn to know him, and how to deal with him, and
so free themselves from the feeling of dread which his name and fame
inspire.

This for a captain is a matter of the very greatest importance, and one
which it might be almost fatal for him to neglect, since to risk a
pitched battle without first giving your soldiers such opportunities to
know their enemy and shake off their fear of him, is to rush on certain
destruction. When Valerius Corvinus was sent by the Romans with their
armies against the Samnites, these being new adversaries with whom up
to that time they had not measured their strength, Titus Livius tells
us that before giving battle he made his men make trial of the enemy in
several unimportant skirmishes, “_lest they should be dismayed by a new
foe and a new method of warfare._” Nevertheless, there is very great
danger that, if your soldiers get the worst in these encounters, their
alarm and self-distrust may be increased, and a result follow contrary
to that intended, namely, that you dispirit where you meant to
reassure.

This, therefore, is one of those cases in which the evil lies so nigh
the good, and both are so mixed up together that you may readily lay
hold of the one when you think to grasp the other. And with regard to
this I say, that a good captain should do what he can that nothing
happen which might discourage his men, nor is there anything so likely
to discourage them as to begin with a defeat. For which reason
skirmishes are, as a rule, to be avoided, and only to be allowed where
you fight to great advantage and with a certainty of victory. In like
manner, no attempt should be made to defend the passes leading into
your country unless your whole army can co-operate; nor are any towns
to be defended save those whose loss necessarily involves your ruin.
And as to those towns which you do defend, you must so arrange, both in
respect of the garrison within and the army without, that in the event
of a siege your whole forces can be employed. All other towns you must
leave undefended. For, provided your army be kept together, you do not,
in losing what you voluntarily abandon, forfeit your military
reputation, or sacrifice your hopes of final success. But when you lose
what it was your purpose, and what all know it was your purpose to
hold, you suffer a real loss and injury, and, like the Gauls on the
defeat of their champion, you are ruined by a mishap of no moment in
itself.

Philip of Macedon, the father of Perseus, a great soldier in his day,
and of a great name, on being invaded by the Romans, laid waste and
relinquished much of his territory which he thought he could not
defend; rightly judging it more hurtful to his reputation to lose
territory after an attempt to defend it, than to abandon it to the
enemy as something he cared little to retain. So, likewise, after the
battle of Cannæ, when their affairs were at their worst, the Romans
refused aid to many subject and protected States, charging them to
defend themselves as best they could. And this is a better course than
to undertake to defend and then to fail; for by refusing to defend, you
lose only your friend; whereas in failing, you not only lose your
friend, but weaken yourself.

But to return to the matter in hand, I affirm, that even when a captain
is constrained by inexperience of his enemy to make trial of him by
means of skirmishes, he ought first to see that he has so much the
advantage that he runs no risk of defeat; or else, and this is his
better course, he must do as Marius did when sent against the
Cimbrians, a very courageous people who were laying Italy waste, and by
their fierceness and numbers, and from the fact of their having already
routed a Roman army, spreading terror wherever they came. For before
fighting a decisive battle, Marius judged it necessary to do something
to lessen the dread in which these enemies were held by his army; and
being a prudent commander, he, on several occasions, posted his men at
points where the Cimbrians must pass, that seeing and growing familiar
with their appearance, while themselves in safety and within the
shelter of their intrenched camp, and finding them to be a mere
disorderly rabble, encumbered with baggage, and either without weapons,
or with none that were formidable, they might at last assume courage
and grow eager to engage them in battle. The part thus prudently taken
by Marius, should be carefully imitated by others who would escape the
dangers above spoken of and not have to betake themselves like the
Gauls to a disgraceful flight, on sustaining some trifling defeat.

But since in this Discourse I have referred by name to Valerius
Corvinus, in my next Chapter I shall cite his words to show what manner
of man a captain ought to be.




CHAPTER XXXVIII.—_Of the Qualities of a Captain in whom his Soldiers
can confide._


Valerius Corvinus, as I have said already, was sent in command of an
army against the Samnites, who were then new enemies to Rome.
Wherefore, to reassure his soldiers and familiarize them with their
adversaries, he made them engage with them in various unimportant
passages of arms. But not thinking this enough, he resolved before
delivering battle to address his men, and by reminding them of their
valour and his own, to make it plain how little they should esteem such
enemies. And from the words which Titus Livius puts in his mouth we may
gather what manner of man the captain ought to be in whom an army will
put its trust. For he makes him say:—“_Bear ye also this in mind under
whose conduct and auspices you are about to fight, and whether he whom
you are to obey be great only in exhorting, bold only in words, and all
unpractised in arms; or whether he be one who himself knows how to use
his spear, to march before the eagles, and play his part in the
thickest of the fight. Soldiers! I would have you follow my deeds and
not my words, and look to me for example rather than for commands; for
with this right hand I have won for myself three consulships, and an
unsurpassed renown._” Which words rightly understood give every one to
know what he must do to merit a captain’s rank. And if any man obtain
it by other means, he will soon discover that advancement due to chance
or intrigue rather takes away than brings reputation, since it is men
who give lustre to titles and not titles to men.

From what has been said it will likewise be understood that if great
captains when matched against an unfamiliar foe have had to resort to
unusual methods for reassuring the minds even of veteran soldiers, much
more will it be necessary for them to use all their address when in
command of a raw and untried army which has never before looked an
enemy in the face. For if an unfamiliar adversary inspire terror even
in a veteran army, how much greater must be the terror which any army
will inspire in the minds of untrained men. And yet we often find all
these difficulties overcome by the supreme prudence of a great captain
like the Roman Gracchus or the Theban Epaminondas, of whom I have
before spoken, who with untried troops defeated the most practised
veterans. And the method they are said to have followed was to train
their men for some months in mimic warfare, so as to accustom them to
discipline and obedience, after which they employed them with complete
confidence on actual service.

No man, therefore, of warlike genius, need despair of creating a good
army if only he have the men; for the prince who has many subjects and
yet lacks soldiers, has only to thank his own inertness and want of
foresight, and must not complain of the cowardice of his people.




CHAPTER XXXIX.—_That a Captain should have good knowledge of Places._


Among other qualifications essential in a good captain is a knowledge,
both general and particular, of places and countries, for without such
knowledge it is impossible for him to carry out any enterprise in the
best way. And while practice is needed for perfection in every art, in
this it is needed in the highest degree. Such practice, or particular
knowledge as it may be termed, is sooner acquired in the chase than in
any other exercise; and, accordingly, we find it said by ancient
historians that those heroes who, in their day, ruled the world, were
bred in the woods and trained to the chase; for this exercise not
merely gives the knowledge I speak of, but teaches countless other
lessons needful in war. And Xenophon in his life of Cyrus tells us,
that Cyrus, on his expedition against the King of Armenia, when
assigning to each of his followers the part he was to perform, reminded
them that the enterprise on which they were engaged, differed little
from one of those hunting expeditions on which they had gone so often
in his company; likening those who were to lie in ambush in the
mountains, to the men sent to spread the toils on the hill-tops; and
those who were to overrun the plain, to the beaters whose business it
is to start the game from its lair that it may be driven into the
toils. Now, this is related to show how, in the opinion of Xenophon,
the chase is a mimic representation of war, and therefore to be
esteemed by the great as useful and honourable.

Nor can that knowledge of countries which I have spoken of as necessary
in a commander, be obtained in any convenient way except by the chase.
For he who joins therein gains a special acquaintance with the
character of the country in which it is followed; and he who has made
himself specially familiar with one district, will afterwards readily
understand the character of any strange country into which he comes.
For all countries, and the districts of which they are made up, have a
certain resemblance to one another, so that from a knowledge of one we
can pass easily to the knowledge of another. He therefore who is
without such practical acquaintance with some one country, can only
with difficulty, and after a long time, obtain a knowledge of another,
while he who possesses it can take in at a glance how this plain
spreads, how that mountain slopes, whither that valley winds, and all
other like particulars in respect of which he has already acquired a
certain familiarity.

The truth of what I affirm is shown by Titus Livius in the case of
Publius Decius, who, being military tribune in the army which the
consul Cornelius led against the Samnites, when the consul advanced
into a defile where the Roman army were like to be shut in by the
enemy, perceiving the great danger they ran, and noting, as Livius
relates, a hill which rose by a steep ascent and overhung the enemy’s
camp, and which, though hard of access for heavy-armed troops,
presented little difficulty to troops lightly armed, turned to the
consul and said:—“_Seest thou, Aulus Cornelius, yonder height over
above the enemy, which they have been blind enough to neglect? There,
were we manfully to seize it, might we find the citadel of our hopes
and of our safety._” Whereupon, he was sent by the consul with three
thousand men to secure the height, and so saved the Roman army. And as
it was part of his plan to make his own escape and carry off his men
safely under shelter of night, Livius represents him as saying to his
soldiers:—“_Come with me, that, while daylight still serves, we may
learn where the enemy have posted their guards, and by what exit we may
issue hence._” Accordingly, putting on the cloak of a common soldier,
lest the enemy should observe that an officer was making his rounds he
surveyed their camp in all directions.

Now any one who carefully studies the whole of this passage, must
perceive how useful and necessary it is for a captain to know the
nature of places, which knowledge had Decius not possessed he could not
have decided that it would be for the advantage of the Roman army to
occupy this hill; nor could he have judged from a distance whether the
hill was accessible or no; and when he reached the summit and desired
to return to the consul, since he was surrounded on all sides by the
enemy, he never could have distinguished the path it was safe for him
to take, from those guarded by the foe. For all which reasons it was
absolutely essential that Decius should have that thorough knowledge
which enabled him by gaining possession of this hill to save the Roman
army, and to discover a path whereby, in the event of his being
attacked, he and his followers might escape.




CHAPTER XL.—_That Fraud is fair in War._


Although in all other affairs it be hateful to use fraud, in the
operations of war it is praiseworthy and glorious; so that he who gets
the better of his enemy by fraud, is as much extolled as he who
prevails by force. This appears in the judgments passed by such as have
written of the lives of great warriors, who praise Hannibal and those
other captains who have been most noted for acting in this way. But
since we may read of many instances of such frauds, I shall not cite
them here. This, however, I desire to say, that I would not have it
understood that any fraud is glorious which leads you to break your
plighted word, or to depart from covenants to which you have agreed;
for though to do so may sometimes gain you territory and power, it can
never, as I have said elsewhere, gain you glory.

The fraud, then, which I here speak of is that employed against an
enemy who places no trust in you, and is wholly directed to military
operations, such as the stratagem of Hannibal at the Lake of
Thrasymene, when he feigned flight in order to draw the Roman consul
and his army into an ambuscade; or when to escape from the hands of
Fabius Maximus he fastened lights to the horns of his oxen. Similar to
the above was the deceit practised by Pontius the Samnite commander to
inveigle the Roman army into the Caudine Forks. For after he had drawn
up his forces behind the hills, he sent out a number of his soldiers,
disguised as herdsmen, to drive great herds of cattle across the plain;
who being captured by the Romans, and interrogated as to where the
Samnite army was, all of them, as they had been taught by Pontius,
agreed in saying that it had gone to besiege Nocera: which being
believed by the consuls, led them to advance within the Caudine Valley,
where no sooner were they come than they were beset by the Samnites.
And the victory thus won by a fraud would have been most glorious for
Pontius had he but taken the advice of his father Herennius, who urged
that the Romans should either be set at liberty unconditionally, or all
be put to death; but that a mean course “_which neither gains friends
nor gets rid of foes_” should be avoided. And this was sound advice,
for, as has already been shown, in affairs of moment a mean course is
always hurtful.




CHAPTER XLI.—_That our Country is to be defended by Honour or by
Dishonour; and in either way is well defended._


The consuls together with the whole Roman army fell, as I have related,
into the hands of the Samnites, who imposed on them the most
ignominious terms, insisting that they should be stripped of their
arms, and pass under the yoke before they were allowed to return to
Rome. The consuls being astounded by the harshness of these conditions
and the whole army overwhelmed with dismay, Lucius Lentulus, the Roman
lieutenant, stood forward and said, that in his opinion they ought to
decline no course whereby their country might be saved; and that as the
very existence of Rome depended on the preservation of her army, that
army must be saved at any sacrifice, for whether the means be
honourable or ignominious, all is well done that is done for the
defence of our country. And he said that were her army preserved, Rome,
in course of time, might wipe out the disgrace; but if her army were
destroyed, however gloriously it might perish, Rome and her freedom
would perish with it. In the event his counsel was followed.

Now this incident deserves to be noted and pondered over by every
citizen who is called on to advise his country; for when the entire
safety of our country is at stake, no consideration of what is just or
unjust, merciful or cruel, praiseworthy or shameful, must intervene. On
the contrary, every other consideration being set aside, that course
alone must be taken which preserves the existence of the country and
maintains its liberty. And this course we find followed by the people
of France, both in their words and in their actions, with the view of
supporting the dignity of their king and the integrity of their
kingdom; for there is no remark they listen to with more impatience
than that this or the other course is disgraceful to the king. For
their king, they say, can incur no disgrace by any resolve he may take,
whether it turn out well or ill; and whether it succeed or fail, all
maintain that he has acted as a king should.




CHAPTER XLII.—_That Promises made on Compulsion are not to be
observed._


When, after being subjected to this disgrace, the consuls returned to
Rome with their disarmed legions, Spurius Posthumius, himself one of
the consuls, was the first to contend in the senate that the terms made
in the Caudine Valley were not to be observed. For he argued that the
Roman people were not bound by them, though he himself doubtless was,
together with all the others who had promised peace; wherefore, if the
people desired to set themselves free from every engagement, he and all
the rest who had given this promise must be made over as prisoners into
the hands of the Samnites. And so steadfastly did he hold to this
opinion, that the senate were content to adopt it, and sending him and
the rest as prisoners back to Samnium, protested to the Samnites that
the peace was not binding. And so kind was Fortune to Posthumius on
this occasion, that the Samnites would not keep him as a prisoner, and
that on his return to Rome, notwithstanding his defeat, he was held in
higher honour by the Romans than the victorious Pontius by his
countrymen.

Here two points are to be noted; first, that glory may be won by any
action; for although, commonly, it follow upon victory, it may also
follow on defeat, if this defeat be seen to have happened through no
fault of yours, or if, directly after, you perform some valiant action
which cancels it. The other point to be noted is that there is no
disgrace in not observing promises wrung from you by force; for
promises thus extorted when they affect the public welfare will always
be broken so soon as the pressure under which they were made is
withdrawn, and that, too, without shame on the part of him who breaks
them; of which we read many instances in history, and find them
constantly occurring at the present day. Nay, as between princes, not
only are such compulsory promises broken when the force which extorted
them is removed, but all other promises as well, are in like manner
disregarded when the causes which led to them no longer operate.

Whether this is a thing to be commended or no, and whether such methods
ought or ought not to be followed by princes, has already been
considered by me in my “_Treatise of the Prince_” wherefore I say no
more on that subject here.




CHAPTER XLIII.—_That Men born in the same Province retain through all
Times nearly the same Character._


The wise are wont to say, and not without reason or at random, that he
who would forecast what is about to happen should look to what has
been; since all human events, whether present or to come, have their
exact counterpart in the past. And this, because these events are
brought about by men, whose passions and dispositions remaining in all
ages the same naturally give rise to the same effects; although,
doubtless, the operation of these causes takes a higher form, now in
one province, and now in another, according to the character of the
training wherein the inhabitants of these provinces acquire their way
of life.

Another aid towards judging of the future by the past, is to observe
how the same nation long retains the same customs, remaining constantly
covetous or deceitful, or similarly stamped by some one vice or virtue.
Any one reading the past history of our city of Florence, and noting
what has recently befallen it, will find the French and German nations
overflowing with avarice, pride, cruelty, and perfidy, all of which
four vices have at divers times wrought much harm to our city. As an
instance of their perfidy, every one knows how often payments of money
were made to Charles VIII. of France, in return for which he engaged to
restore the fortresses of Pisa, yet never did restore them, manifesting
thereby his bad faith and grasping avarice. Or, to pass from these very
recent events, all may have heard of what happened in the war in which
the Florentines were involved with the Visconti, dukes of Milan, when
Florence, being left without other resource, resolved to invite the
emperor into Italy, that she might be assisted by his name and power in
her struggle with Lombardy. The emperor promised to come with a strong
army to take part against the Visconti and to protect Florence from
them, on condition that the Florentines paid him a hundred thousand
ducats on his setting out, and another hundred thousand on his arrival
in Italy; to which terms the Florentines agreed. But although he then
received payment of the first instalment and, afterwards, on reaching
Verona, of the second, he turned back from the expedition without
effecting anything, alleging as his excuse that he was stopped by
certain persons who had failed to fulfil their engagements. But if
Florence had not been urged by passion or overcome by necessity, or had
she read of and understood the ancient usages of the barbarians, she
would neither on this, nor on many other occasions, have been deceived
by them, seeing that these nations have always been of the same
character, and have always, in all circumstances, and with all men
alike, used the same methods. For in ancient times we find them
behaving after the same fashion to the Etruscans, who, when overpowered
by the Romans, by whom they had been repeatedly routed and put to
flight, perceiving that they could not stand without help, entered into
a compact with the Gauls dwelling in the parts of Italy south of the
Alps, to pay them a certain sum if they would unite with them in a
campaign against the Romans. But the Gauls, after taking their money,
refused to arm on their behalf, alleging that they had not been paid to
make war on the enemies of the Etruscans, but only to refrain from
pillaging their lands. And thus the people of Etruria, through the
avarice and perfidy of the Gauls, were at once defrauded of their money
and disappointed of the help which they had counted on obtaining.

From which two instances of the Etruscans in ancient times and of the
Florentines in recent, we may see that barbaric races have constantly
followed the same methods, and may easily draw our conclusions as to
how far princes should trust them.




CHAPTER XLIV.—_That where ordinary methods fail, Hardihood and Daring
often succeed._


When attacked by the Romans, the Samnites as they could not without
help stand against them in the field, resolved to leave garrisons in
the towns of Samnium, and to pass with their main army into Etruria,
that country being then at truce with Rome, and thus ascertain whether
their actual presence in arms might not move the Etruscans to renew
hostilities against Rome, which they had refused to renew when invited
through envoys. During the negotiations which, on this occasion, passed
between the two nations, the Samnites in explaining the chief causes
that led them to take up arms, used the memorable words—“_they had
risen because peace is a heavier burthen for slaves than war for
freemen_” In the end, partly by their persuasions, and partly by the
presence of their army, they induced the Etruscans to join forces with
them.

Here we are to note that when a prince would obtain something from
another, he ought, if the occasion allow, to leave him no time to
deliberate, but should so contrive that the other may see the need of
resolving at once; as he will, if he perceive that refusal or delay in
complying with what is asked of him, will draw upon him a sudden and
dangerous resentment.

This method we have seen employed with good effect in our own times by
Pope Julius II. in dealing with France, and by M. de Foix, the general
of the French king, in dealing with the Marquis of Mantua. For Pope
Julius desiring to expel the Bentivogli from Bologna, and thinking that
for this purpose he needed the help of French troops, and to have the
Venetians neutral, after sounding both and receiving from both
hesitating and ambiguous answers, determined to make both fall in with
his views, by giving them no time to oppose him; and so, setting forth
from Rome with as strong a force as he could get together, he marched
on Bologna, sending word to the Venetians that they must stand aloof,
and to the King of France to send him troops. The result was that in
the brief time allowed them, neither of the two powers could make up
their mind to thwart him; and knowing that refusal or delay would be
violently resented by the Pope, they yielded to his demands, the king
sending him soldiers and the Venetians maintaining neutrality.

M. de Foix, again, being with the king’s army in Bologna when word came
that Brescia had risen, could not rest till he had recovered that town.
But, to get there he had to choose between two routes, one long and
circuitous leading through the territories of the king, the other short
and direct. In taking the latter route, however, not only would he have
to pass through the dominions of the Marquis of Mantua, but also to
make his way into these through the lakes and marshes wherewith that
country abounds, by following an embanked road, closed and guarded by
the marquis with forts and other defensive works. Resolving,
nevertheless, to take the shortest road at all hazards, he waited till
his men were already on their march before signifying to the marquis
that he desired leave to pass through his country, so that no time
might be left him to deliberate. Taken aback by the unexpected demand,
the marquis gave the leave sought, which he never would have given had
De Foix acted with less impetuosity. For he was in league with the
Venetians and with the Pope, and had a son in the hands of the latter;
all which circumstances would have afforded him fair pretexts for
refusal. But carried away by the suddenness and urgency of the demand,
he yielded. And in like manner the Etruscans yielded to the instances
of the Samnites, the presence of whose army decided them to renew
hostilities which before they had declined to renew.




CHAPTER XLV.—_Whether in battle it is better to await and repel the
Enemy’s attack, or to anticipate it by an impetuous onset._


Decius and Fabius, the Roman consuls, were each of them in command of a
separate army, one directed against the Samnites, the other against the
Etruscans: and as both delivered battle, we have to pronounce, in
respect of the two engagements, which commander followed the better
method. Decius attacked his enemy at once with the utmost fury and with
his whole strength. Fabius was content, at first, merely to maintain
his ground; for judging that more was to be gained by a later attack,
he reserved his forces for a final effort, when the ardour of the enemy
had cooled and his energy spent itself. The event showed Fabius to be
more successful in his tactics than Decius, who being exhausted by his
first onset, and seeing his ranks begin to waver, to secure by death
the glory he could no longer hope from victory, followed the example
set him by his father, and sacrificed himself to save the Roman
legions. Word whereof being brought to Fabius, he, to gain, while he
yet lived, as much honour as the other had earned by his death, pushed
forward all the troops he had reserved for his final effort, and so
obtained an unexampled victory. Whence we see that of the two methods,
that of Fabius was the safer and the more deserving our imitation.




CHAPTER XLVI.—_How the Characteristics of Families come to be
perpetuated._


Manners and institutions differing in different cities, seem here to
produce a harder and there a softer race; and a like difference may
also be discerned in the character of different families in the same
city. And while this holds good of all cities, we have many instances
of it in reading the history of Rome. For we find the Manlii always
stern and stubborn; the Valerii kindly and courteous; the Claudii
haughty and ambitious; and many families besides similarly
distinguished from one another by their peculiar qualities.

These qualities we cannot refer wholly to the _blood_, for that must
change as a result of repeated intermarriages, but must ascribe rather
to the different training and education given in different families.
For much turns on whether a child of tender years hears a thing well or
ill spoken of, since this must needs make an impression on him whereby
his whole conduct in after life will be influenced. Were it otherwise
we should not have found the whole family of the Claudii moved by the
desires and stirred by the passions which Titus Livius notes in many of
them, and more especially in one holding the office of censor, who,
when his colleague laid down his magistracy, as the law prescribed, at
the end of eighteen months, would not resign, maintaining that he was
entitled to hold the office for five years in accordance with the
original law by which the censorship was regulated. And although his
refusal gave occasion to much controversy, and bred great tumult and
disturbance, no means could be found to depose him from his office,
which he persisted in retaining in opposition to the will of the entire
commons and a majority of the senate. And any who shall read the speech
made against him by Publius Sempronius, tribune of the people, will
find therein all the Claudian insolence exposed, and will recognize the
docility and good temper shown by the body of the citizens in
respecting the laws and institutions of their country.




CHAPTER XLVII.—_That love of his Country should lead a good Citizen to
forget private Wrongs._


While commanding as consul against the Samnites, Manlius was wounded in
a skirmish. His army being thereby endangered, the senate judged it
expedient to send Papirius Cursor as dictator to supply his place. But
as it was necessary that the dictator should be nominated by Fabius,
the other consul, who was with the army in Etruria, and as a doubt was
felt that he might refuse to nominate Papirius, who was his enemy, the
senate sent two messengers to entreat him to lay aside private
animosity, and make the nomination which the public interest required.
Moved by love of his country Fabius did as he was asked, although by
his silence, and by many other signs, he gave it to be known that
compliance was distasteful. From his conduct at this juncture all who
would be thought good citizens should take example.




CHAPTER XLVIII.—_That on finding an Enemy make what seems a grave
blunder, we should suspect some fraud to lurk behind._


The consul having gone to Rome to perform certain ceremonial rites, and
Fulvius being left in charge of the Roman army in Etruria, the
Etruscans, to see whether they could not circumvent the new commander,
planting an ambush not far from the Roman camp, sent forward soldiers
disguised as shepherds driving large flocks of sheep so as to pass in
sight of the Roman army. These pretended shepherds coming close to the
wall of his camp, Fulvius, marvelling at what appeared to him
unaccountable audacity, hit upon a device whereby the artifice of the
Etruscans was detected and their design defeated.

Here it seems proper to note that the captain of an army ought not to
build on what seems a manifest blunder on the part of an enemy; for as
men are unlikely to act with conspicuous want of caution, it will
commonly be found that this blunder is cover to a fraud. And yet, so
blinded are men’s minds by their eagerness for victory, that they look
only to what appears on the surface.

After defeating the Romans on the Allia, the Gauls, hastening on to
Rome, found the gates of the city left open and unguarded. But fearing
some stratagem, and being unable to believe that the Romans could be so
foolish and cowardly as to abandon their city, they waited during the
whole of that day and the following night outside the gates, without
daring to enter. In the year 1508, when the Florentines Avere engaged
in besieging Pisa, Alfonso del Mutolo, a citizen of that town,
happening to be taken prisoner, was released on his promise to procure
the surrender to the Florentines of one of the gates of the city.
Afterwards, on pretence of arranging for the execution of this
surrender, he came repeatedly to confer with those whom the Florentine
commissaries had deputed to treat with him, coming not secretly but
openly, and accompanied by other citizens of Pisa, whom he caused to
stand aside while he conversed with the Florentines. From all which
circumstances his duplicity might have been suspected, since, had he
meant to do as he had engaged, it was most unlikely that he should be
negotiating so openly. But the desire to recover possession of Pisa so
blinded the Florentines that they allowed themselves to be conducted
under his guidance to the Lucca Gate, where, through his treachery, but
to their own disgrace, they lost a large number of their men and
officers.




CHAPTER XLIX.—_That a Commonwealth to preserve its Freedom has constant
need of new Ordinances. Of the services in respect of which Quintius
Fabius received the surname of Maximus._


It must happen, as I have already said, in every great city, that
disorders needing the care of the physician continually spring up; and
the graver these disorders are, the greater will be the skill needed
for their treatment. And if ever in any city, most assuredly in Rome,
we see these disorders assume strange and unexpected shapes. As when it
appeared that all the Roman wives had conspired to murder their
husbands, many of them being found to have actually administered
poison, and many others to have drugs in readiness for the purpose.

Of like nature was the conspiracy of the Bacchanals, discovered at the
time of the Macedonian war, wherein many thousands, both men and women,
were implicated, and which, had it not been found out, or had the
Romans not been accustomed to deal with large bodies of offenders, must
have proved perilous for their city. And, indeed, if the greatness of
the Roman Republic were not declared by countless other signs, as well
as by the manner in which it caused its laws to be observed, it might
be seen in the character of the punishments which it inflicted against
wrong-doers. For in vindicating justice, it would not scruple or
hesitate to put a whole legion to death, to depopulate an entire city,
or send eight or ten thousand men at a time into banishment, subject to
the most stringent conditions, which had to be observed, not by one of
these exiles only, but by all. As in the case of those soldiers who
fought unsuccessfully at Cannæ, who were banished to Sicily, subject to
the condition that they should not harbour in towns, and should all eat
standing.

But the most formidable of all their punishments was that whereby one
man out of every ten in an entire army was chosen by lot to be put to
death. For correcting a great body of men no more effectual means could
be devised; because, when a multitude have offended and the ringleaders
are not known, all cannot be punished, their number being too great;
while to punish some only, and leave the rest unpunished, were unjust
to those punished and an encouragement to those passed over to offend
again. But where you put to death a tenth chosen by lot, where all
equally deserve death, he who is punished will blame his unlucky
fortune, while he who escapes will be afraid that another time the lot
may be his, and for that reason will be careful how he repeats his
offence. The poisoners and the Bacchanals, therefore, were punished as
their crimes deserved.

Although disorders like these occasion mischievous results in a
commonwealth, still they are not fatal, since almost always there is
time to correct them. But no time is given in the case of disorders in
the State itself, which unless they be treated by some wise citizen,
will always bring a city to destruction. From the readiness wherewith
the Romans conferred the right of citizenship on foreigners, there came
to be so many new citizens in Rome, and possessed of so large a share
of the suffrage, that the government itself began to alter, forsaking
those courses which it was accustomed to follow, and growing estranged
from the men to whom it had before looked for guidance. Which being
observed by Quintius Fabius when censor, he caused all those new
citizens to be classed in four _Tribes_, that being reduced within this
narrow limit they might not have it in their power to corrupt the
entire State. And this was a wisely contrived measure, for, without
introducing any violent change, it supplied a convenient remedy, and
one so acceptable to the republic as to gain for Fabius the
well-deserved name of Maximus.

INTRODUCTION

Niccolo Machiavelli, the first great Italian historian, and one of
the most eminent political writers of any age or country, was born
at Florence, May 3, 1469. He was of an old though not wealthy Tuscan
family, his father, who was a jurist, dying when Niccolo was sixteen
years old. We know nothing of Machiavelli's youth and little about
his studies. He does not seem to have received the usual humanistic
education of his time, as he knew no Greek.[*] The first notice of
Machiavelli is in 1498 when we find him holding the office of Secretary
in the second Chancery of the Signoria, which office he retained till
the downfall of the Florentine Republic in 1512. His unusual ability was
soon recognized, and in 1500 he was sent on a mission to Louis XII.
of France, and afterward on an embassy to Cæsar Borgia, the lord of
Romagna, at Urbino. Machiavelli's report and description of this and
subsequent embassies to this prince, shows his undisguised admiration
for the courage and cunning of Cæsar, who was a master in the
application of the principles afterwards exposed in such a skillful and
uncompromising manner by Machiavelli in his _Prince_.

The limits of this introduction will not permit us to follow with any
detail the many important duties with which he was charged by his native
state, all of which he fulfilled with the utmost fidelity and with
consummate skill. When, after the battle of Ravenna in 1512 the holy
league determined upon the downfall of Pier Soderini, Gonfaloniere of
the Florentine Republic, and the restoration of the Medici, the efforts
of Machiavelli, who was an ardent republican, were in vain; the troops
he had helped to organize fled before the Spaniards and the Medici were
returned to power. Machiavelli attempted to conciliate his new masters,
but he was deprived of his office, and being accused in the following
year of participation in the conspiracy of Boccoli and Capponi, he was
imprisoned and tortured, though afterward set at liberty by Pope Leo
X. He now retired to a small estate near San Casciano, seven miles from
Florence. Here he devoted himself to political and historical studies,
and though apparently retired from public life, his letters show the
deep and passionate interest he took in the political vicissitudes
through which Italy was then passing, and in all of which the singleness
of purpose with which he continued to advance his native Florence, is
clearly manifested. It was during his retirement upon his little estate
at San Casciano that Machiavelli wrote _The Prince_, the most famous of
all his writings, and here also he had begun a much more extensive work,
his _Discourses on the Decades of Livy_, which continued to occupy him
for several years. These _Discourses_, which do not form a continuous
commentary on Livy, give Machiavelli an opportunity to express his own
views on the government of the state, a task for which his long and
varied political experience, and an assiduous study of the ancients
rendered him eminently qualified. The _Discourses_ and _The Prince_,
written at the same time, supplement each other and are really one work.
Indeed, the treatise, _The Art of War_, though not written till 1520
should be mentioned here because of its intimate connection with these
two treatises, it being, in fact, a further development of some of
the thoughts expressed in the _Discorsi_. _The Prince_, a short work,
divided into twenty-six books, is the best known of all Machiavelli's
writings. Herein he expresses in his own masterly way his views on the
founding of a new state, taking for his type and model Cæsar Borgia,
although the latter had failed in his schemes for the consolidation of
his power in the Romagna. The principles here laid down were the natural
outgrowth of the confused political conditions of his time. And as in
the _Principe_, as its name indicates, Machiavelli is concerned chiefly
with the government of a Prince, so the _Discorsi_ treat principally
of the Republic, and here Machiavelli's model republic was the Roman
commonwealth, the most successful and most enduring example of popular
government. Free Rome is the embodiment of his political idea of the
state. Much that Machiavelli says in this treatise is as true to-day and
holds as good as the day it was written. And to us there is much that
is of especial importance. To select a chapter almost at random, let us
take Book I., Chap. XV.: "Public affairs are easily managed in a city
where the body of the people is not corrupt; and where equality
exists, there no principality can be established; nor can a republic be
established where there is no equality."

No man has been more harshly judged than Machiavelli, especially in
the two centuries following his death. But he has since found many able
champions and the tide has turned. _The Prince_ has been termed a manual
for tyrants, the effect of which has been most pernicious. But were
Machiavelli's doctrines really new? Did he discover them? He merely had
the candor and courage to write down what everybody was thinking and
what everybody knew. He merely gives us the impressions he had received
from a long and intimate intercourse with princes and the affairs of
state. It was Lord Bacon, I believe, who said that Machiavelli tells us
what princes do, not what they ought to do. When Machiavelli takes Cæsar
Borgia as a model, he in nowise extols him as a hero, but merely as a
prince who was capable of attaining the end in view. The life of the
State was the primary object. It must be maintained. And Machiavelli has
laid down the principles, based upon his study and wide experience,
by which this may be accomplished. He wrote from the view-point of
the politician,--not of the moralist. What is good politics may be bad
morals, and in fact, by a strange fatality, where morals and politics
clash, the latter generally gets the upper hand. And will anyone contend
that the principles set forth by Machiavelli in his _Prince_ or his
_Discourses_ have entirely perished from the earth? Has diplomacy been
entirely stripped of fraud and duplicity? Let anyone read the famous
eighteenth chapter of _The Prince_: "In what Manner Princes should keep
their Faith," and he will be convinced that what was true nearly four
hundred years ago, is quite as true to-day.

Of the remaining works of Machiavelli the most important is the _History
of Florence_ written between 1521 and 1525, and dedicated to Clement
VII. The first book is merely a rapid review of the Middle Ages, the
history of Florence beginning with Book II. Machiavelli's method has
been censured for adhering at times too closely to the chroniclers like
Villani, Cambi, and Giovanni Cavalcanti, and at others rejecting their
testimony without apparent reason, while in its details the authority of
his _History_ is often questionable. It is the straightforward, logical
narrative, which always holds the interest of the reader that is the
greatest charm of the _History_. Of the other works of Machiavelli we
may mention here his comedies the _Mandragola_ and _Clizia_, and his
novel _Belfagor_.

After the downfall of the Republic and Machiavelli's release from prison
in 1513, fortune seems never again to have favoured him. It is true that
in 1520 Giuliano de' Medici commissioned him to write his _History of
Florence_, and he afterwards held a number of offices, yet these
latter were entirely beneath his merits. He had been married in 1502 to
Marietta Corsini, who bore him four sons and a daughter. He died on June
22, 1527, leaving his family in the greatest poverty, a sterling tribute
to his honesty, when one considers the many opportunities he doubtless
had to enrich himself. Machiavelli's life was not without blemish--few
lives are. We must bear in mind the atmosphere of craft, hypocrisy, and
poison in which he lived,--his was the age of Cæsar Borgia and of Popes
like the monster Alexander VI. and Julius II. Whatever his faults may
have been, Machiavelli was always an ardent patriot and an earnest
supporter of popular government. It is true that he was willing to
accept a prince, if one could be found courageous enough and prudent
enough to unite dismembered Italy, for in the unity of his native land
he saw the only hope of its salvation.

Machiavelli is buried in the church of Santa Croce at Florence, beside
the tomb of Michael Angelo. His monument bears this inscription:

"Tanto nomini nullum par eulogium."

And though this praise is doubtless exaggerated, he is a son of whom his
country may be justly proud.

THE FLORENTINE HISTORY OF NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI




BOOK I



CHAPTER I

Irruption of Northern people upon the Roman
territories--Visigoths--Barbarians called in by Stilicho--Vandals
in Africa--Franks and Burgundians give their names to France and
Burgundy--The Huns--Angles give the name to England--Attila, king of the
Huns, in Italy--Genseric takes Rome--The Lombards.

The people who inhabit the northern parts beyond the Rhine and the
Danube, living in a healthy and prolific region, frequently increase to
such vast multitudes that part of them are compelled to abandon their
native soil, and seek a habitation in other countries. The method
adopted, when one of these provinces had to be relieved of its
superabundant population, was to divide into three parts, each
containing an equal number of nobles and of people, of rich and of poor.
The third upon whom the lot fell, then went in search of new abodes,
leaving the remaining two-thirds in possession of their native country.

These migrating masses destroyed the Roman empire by the facilities for
settlement which the country offered when the emperors abandoned
Rome, the ancient seat of their dominion, and fixed their residence at
Constantinople; for by this step they exposed the western empire to
the rapine of both their ministers and their enemies, the remoteness of
their position preventing them either from seeing or providing for
its necessities. To suffer the overthrow of such an extensive empire,
established by the blood of so many brave and virtuous men, showed no
less folly in the princes themselves than infidelity in their ministers;
for not one irruption alone, but many, contributed to its ruin;
and these barbarians exhibited much ability and perseverance in
accomplishing their object.

The first of these northern nations that invaded the empire after the
Cimbrians, who were conquered by Caius Marius, was the Visigoths--which
name in our language signifies "Western Goths." These, after some
battles fought along its confines, long held their seat of dominion upon
the Danube, with consent of the emperors; and although, moved by various
causes, they often attacked the Roman provinces, were always kept in
subjection by the imperial forces. The emperor Theodosius conquered them
with great glory; and, being wholly reduced to his power, they no longer
selected a sovereign of their own, but, satisfied with the terms which
he granted them, lived and fought under his ensigns, and authority. On
the death of Theodosius, his sons Arcadius and Honorius, succeeded to
the empire, but not to the talents and fortune of their father; and
the times became changed with the princes. Theodosius had appointed a
governor to each of the three divisions of the empire, Ruffinus to the
eastern, to the western Stilicho, and Gildo to the African. Each of
these, after the death of Theodosius, determined not to be governors
merely, but to assume sovereign dominion over their respective
provinces. Gildo and Ruffinus were suppressed at their outset; but
Stilicho, concealing his design, ingratiated himself with the new
emperors, and at the same time so disturbed their government, as to
facilitate his occupation of it afterward. To make the Visigoths their
enemies, he advised that the accustomed stipend allowed to this people
should be withheld; and as he thought these enemies would not
be sufficient alone to disturb the empire, he contrived that the
Burgundians, Franks, Vandals, and Alans (a northern people in search of
new habitations), should assail the Roman provinces.

That they might be better able to avenge themselves for the injury
they had sustained, the Visigoths, on being deprived of their subsidy,
created Alaric their king; and having assailed the empire, succeeded,
after many reverses, in overrunning Italy, and finally in pillaging
Rome.

After this victory, Alaric died, and his successor, Astolphus, having
married Placidia, sister of the emperors, agreed with them to go to
the relief of Gaul and Spain, which provinces had been assailed by
the Vandals, Burgundians, Alans, and Franks, from the causes before
mentioned. Hence it followed, that the Vandals, who had occupied that
part of Spain called Betica (now Andalusia), being pressed by the
Visigoths, and unable to resist them, were invited by Boniface, who
governed Africa for the empire, to occupy that province; for, being in
rebellion, he was afraid his error would become known to the emperor.
For these reasons the Vandals gladly undertook the enterprise, and under
Genseric, their king, became lords of Africa.

At this time Theodosius, son of Arcadius, succeeded to the empire; and,
bestowing little attention on the affairs of the west, caused those who
had taken possession to think of securing their acquisitions. Thus the
Vandals ruled Africa; the Alans and Visigoths, Spain; while the Franks
and Burgundians not only took Gaul, but each gave their name to the part
they occupied; hence one is called France, the other Burgundy. The good
fortune of these brought fresh people to the destruction of the empire,
one of which, the Huns, occupied the province of Pannonia, situated upon
the nearer shore of the Danube, and which, from their name, is still
called Hungary. To these disorders it must be added, that the emperor,
seeing himself attacked on so many sides, to lessen the number of his
enemies, began to treat first with the Vandals, then with the Franks;
a course which diminished his own power, and increased that of the
barbarians. Nor was the island of Britain, which is now called England,
secure from them; for the Britons, being apprehensive of those who had
occupied Gaul, called the Angli, a people of Germany, to their aid; and
these under Vortigern their king, first defended, and then drove them
from the island, of which they took possession, and after themselves
named the country England. But the inhabitants, being robbed of their
home, became desperate by necessity and resolved to take possession of
some other country, although they had been unable to defend their own.
They therefore crossed the sea with their families, and settled in the
country nearest to the beach, which from themselves is called Brittany.
The Huns, who were said above to have occupied Pannonia, joining with
other nations, as the Zepidi, Eurili, Turingi, and Ostro, or eastern
Goths, moved in search of new countries, and not being able to enter
France, which was defended by the forces of the barbarians, came into
Italy under Attila their king. He, a short time previously, in order to
possess the entire monarchy, had murdered his brother Bleda; and having
thus become very powerful, Andaric, king of the Zepidi, and Velamir,
king of the Ostrogoths, became subject to him. Attila, having entered
Italy, laid siege to Aquileia, where he remained without any
obstacle for two years, wasting the country round, and dispersing the
inhabitants. This, as will be related in its place, caused the origin
of Venice. After the taking and ruin of Aquileia, he directed his course
towards Rome, from the destruction of which he abstained at the entreaty
of the pontiff, his respect for whom was so great that he left Italy and
retired into Austria, where he died. After the death of Attila, Velamir,
king of the Ostrogoths, and the heads of the other nations, took arms
against his sons Henry and Uric, slew the one and compelled the other,
with his Huns, to repass the Danube and return to their country; while
the Ostrogoths and the Zepidi established themselves in Pannonia, and
the Eruli and the Turingi upon the farther bank of the Danube.

Attila having left Italy, Valentinian, emperor of the west, thought of
restoring the country; and, that he might be more ready to defend
it against the barbarians, abandoned Rome, and removed the seat of
government to Ravenna. The misfortunes which befell the western empire
caused the emperor, who resided at Constantinople, on many occasions to
give up the possession of it to others, as a charge full of danger
and expense; and sometimes, without his permission, the Romans, seeing
themselves so abandoned, created an emperor for their defense, or
suffered some one to usurp the dominion. This occurred at the period
of which we now speak, when Maximus, a Roman, after the death of
Valentinian, seized the government, and compelled Eudocia, widow of the
late emperor, to take him for her husband; but she, being of imperial
blood, scorned the connection of a private citizen; and being anxious to
avenge herself for the insult, secretly persuaded Genseric, king of the
Vandals and master of Africa to come to Italy, representing to him the
advantage he would derive from the undertaking, and the facility with
which it might be accomplished. Tempted by the hope of booty, he came
immediately, and finding Rome abandoned, plundered the city during
fourteen days. He also ravaged many other places in Italy, and then,
loaded with wealth, withdrew to Africa. The Romans, having returned
to their city, and Maximus being dead, elected Avitus, a Roman, as his
successor. After this, several important events occurred both in Italy
and in the countries beyond; and after the deaths of many emperors
the empire of Constantinople devolved upon Zeno, and that of Rome upon
Orestes and Augustulus his son, who obtained the sovereignty by fraud.
While they were designing to hold by force what they had obtained by
treachery, the Eruli and the Turingi, who, after the death of Attila, as
before remarked, had established themselves upon the farther bank of
the Danube, united in a league and invaded Italy under Odoacer their
general. Into the districts which they left unoccupied, the Longobardi
or Lombards, also a northern people, entered, led by Godogo their king.
Odoacer conquered and slew Orestes near Pavia, but Augustulus escaped.
After this victory, that Rome might, with her change of power, also
change her title, Odoacer, instead of using the imperial name, caused
himself to be declared king of Rome. He was the first of those leaders
who at this period overran the world and thought of settling in Italy;
for the others, either from fear that they should not be able to hold
the country, knowing that it might easily be relieved by the eastern
emperors, or from some unknown cause, after plundering her, sought other
countries wherein to establish themselves.



CHAPTER II

State of the Roman empire under Zeno--Theodoric king of the
Ostrogoths--Character of Theodoric--Changes in the Roman empire--New
languages--New names--Theodoric dies--Belisarius in Italy--Totila takes
Rome--Narses destroys the Goths--New form of Government in Italy--Narses
invites the Lombards into Italy--The Lombards change the form of
government.

At this time the ancient Roman empire was governed by the following
princes: Zeno, reigning in Constantinople, commanded the whole of the
eastern empire; the Ostrogoths ruled Mesia and Pannonia; the Visigoths,
Suavi, and Alans, held Gascony and Spain; the Vandals, Africa; the
Franks and Burgundians, France; and the Eruli and Turingi, Italy. The
kingdom of the Ostrogoths had descended to Theodoric, nephew of Velamir,
who, being on terms of friendship with Zeno the eastern emperor, wrote
to him that his Ostrogoths thought it an injustice that they, being
superior in valor to the people thereabout, should be inferior to them
in dominion, and that it was impossible for him to restrain them within
the limits of Pannonia. So, seeing himself under the necessity of
allowing them to take arms and go in search of new abodes, he wished
first to acquaint Zeno with it, in order that he might provide for them,
by granting some country in which they might establish themselves, by
his good favor with greater propriety and convenience. Zeno, partly
from fear and partly from a desire to drive Odoacer out of Italy, gave
Theodoric permission to lead his people against him, and take possession
of the country. Leaving his friends the Zepidi in Pannonia, Theodoric
marched into Italy, slew Odoacer and his son, and, moved by the same
reasons which had induced Valentinian to do so, established his court at
Ravenna, and like Odoacer took the title of king of Italy.

Theodoric possessed great talents both for war and peace; in the former
he was always conqueror, and in the latter he conferred very great
benefits upon the cities and people under him. He distributed the
Ostrogoths over the country, each district under its leader, that he
might more conveniently command them in war, and govern them in peace.
He enlarged Ravenna, restored Rome, and, with the exception of military
discipline, conferred upon the Romans every honor. He kept within
their proper bounds, wholly by the influence of his character, all the
barbarian kings who occupied the empire; he built towns and fortresses
between the point of the Adriatic and the Alps, in order, with the
greater facility, to impede the passage of any new hordes of barbarians
who might design to assail Italy; and if, toward the latter end of his
life, so many virtues had not been sullied by acts of cruelty, caused
by various jealousies of his people, such as the death of Symmachus and
Boethius, men of great holiness, every point of his character would have
deserved the highest praise. By his virtue and goodness, not only
Rome and Italy, but every part of the western empire, freed from the
continual troubles which they had suffered from the frequent influx
of barbarians, acquired new vigor, and began to live in an orderly and
civilized manner. For surely if any times were truly miserable for
Italy and the provinces overrun by the barbarians, they were those which
occurred from Arcadius and Honorius to Theodoric. If we only consider
the evils which arise to a republic or a kingdom by a change of prince
or of government; not by foreign interference, but by civil discord (in
which we may see how even slight variations suffice to ruin the most
powerful kingdoms or states), we may then easily imagine how much Italy
and the other Roman provinces suffered, when they not only changed their
forms of government and their princes, but also their laws, customs,
modes of living, religion, language, and name. Any one of such changes,
by itself, without being united with others, might, with thinking of
it, to say nothing of the seeing and suffering, infuse terror into the
strongest minds.

From these causes proceeded the ruin as well as the origin and extension
of many cities. Among those which were ruined were Aquileia, Luni,
Chiusi, Popolonia, Fiesole, and many others. The new cities were Venice,
Sienna, Ferrara, Aquila, with many towns and castles which for brevity
we omit. Those which became extended were Florence, Genoa, Pisa,
Milan, Naples, and Bologna; to all of which may be added, the ruin and
restoration of Rome, and of many other cities not previously mentioned.

From this devastation and new population arose new languages, as we see
in the different dialects of France, Spain and Italy; which, partaking
of the native idiom of the new people and of the old Roman, formed a
new manner of discourse. Besides, not only were the names of provinces
changed, but also of lakes, rivers, seas, and men; for France, Spain,
and Italy are full of fresh names, wholly different from the
ancient; as, omitting many others, we see that the Po, the Garda, the
Archipelago, are names quite different from those which the ancients
used; while instead of Cæsar and Pompey we have Peter, Matthew, John,
etc.

Among so many variations, that of religion was not of little importance;
for, while combating the customs of the ancient faith with the miracles
of the new, very serious troubles and discords were created among men.
And if the Christians had been united in one faith, fewer disorders
would have followed; but the contentions among themselves, of the
churches of Rome, Greece, and Ravenna, joined to those of the heretic
sects with the Catholics, served in many ways to render the world
miserable. Africa is a proof of this; having suffered more horrors from
the Arian sect, whose doctrines were believed by the Vandals, than from
any avarice or natural cruelty of the people themselves. Living amid so
many persecutions, the countenances of men bore witness of the terrible
impressions upon their minds; for besides the evils they suffered from
the disordered state of the world, they scarcely could have recourse to
the help of God, in whom the unhappy hope for relief; for the greater
part of them, being uncertain what divinity they ought to address, died
miserably, without help and without hope.

Having been the first who put a stop to so many evils, Theodoric
deserves the highest praise: for during the thirty-eight years he
reigned in Italy, he brought the country to such a state of greatness
that her previous sufferings were no longer recognizable. But at his
death, the kingdom descending to Atalaric, son of Amalasontha, his
daughter, and the malice of fortune not being yet exhausted, the old
evils soon returned; for Atalaric died soon after his grandfather, and
the kingdom coming into the possession of his mother, she was betrayed
by Theodatus, whom she had called to assist her in the government. He
put her to death and made himself king; and having thus become odious
to the Ostrogoths, the emperor Justinian entertained the hope of driving
him out of Italy. Justinian appointed Belisarius to the command of this
expedition, as he had already conquered Africa, expelled the Vandals,
and reduced the country to the imperial rule.

Belisarius took possession of Sicily, and from thence passing into
Italy, occupied Naples and Rome. The Goths, seeing this, slew Theodatus
their king, whom they considered the cause of their misfortune, and
elected Vitiges in his stead, who, after some skirmishes, was besieged
and taken by Belisarius at Ravenna; but before he had time to secure
the advantages of his victory, Belisarius was recalled by Justinian, and
Joannes and Vitalis were appointed in his place. Their principles and
practices were so different from those of Belisarius, that the Goths
took courage and created Ildovadus, governor of Verona, their king.
After Ildovadus, who was slain, came Totila, who routed the imperial
forces, took Tuscany and Naples, and recovered nearly the whole of what
Belisarius had taken from them. On this account Justinian determined to
send him into Italy again; but, coming with only a small force, he lost
the reputation which his former victories had won for him, in less time
than he had taken to acquire it. Totila being at Ostia with his forces,
took Rome before his eyes; but being unable to hold or to leave the
city, he destroyed the greater part of it, drove out the citizens, and
took the senators away from him. Thinking little of Belisarius, he led
his people into Calabria, to attack the forces which had been sent from
Greece.

Belisarius, seeing the city abandoned, turned his mind to the
performance of an honourable work. Viewing the ruins of Rome, he
determined to rebuild her walls and recall her inhabitants with as
little delay as possible. But fortune was opposed to this laudable
enterprise; for Justinian, being at this time assailed by the Parthians,
recalled him; and his duty to his sovereign compelled him to abandon
Italy to Totila, who again took Rome, but did not treat her with
such severity as upon the former occasion; for at the entreaty of
St. Benedict, who in those days had great reputation for sanctity, he
endeavored to restore her. In the meantime, Justinian having arranged
matters with the Parthians, again thought of sending a force to the
relief of Italy; but the Sclavi, another northern people, having crossed
the Danube and attacked Illyria and Thrace, prevented him, so that
Totila held almost the whole country. Having conquered the Slavonians,
Justinian sent Narses, a eunuch, a man of great military talent, who,
having arrived in Italy, routed and slew Totila. The Goths who escaped
sought refuge in Pavia, where they created Teias their king. On the
other hand, Narses after the victory took Rome, and coming to an
engagement with Teias near Nocera, slew him and routed his army. By this
victory, the power of the Goths in Italy was quite annihilated, after
having existed for seventy years, from the coming of Theodoric to the
death of Teias.

No sooner was Italy delivered from the Goths than Justinian died, and
was succeeded by Justin, his son, who, at the instigation of Sophia, his
wife, recalled Narses, and sent Longinus in his stead. Like those who
preceded him, he made his abode at Ravenna, and besides this, gave a
new form to the government of Italy; for he did not appoint governors
of provinces, as the Goths had done, but in every city and town of
importance placed a ruler whom he called a duke. Neither in this
arrangement did he respect Rome more than the other cities; for having
set aside the consuls and senate, names which up to this time had been
preserved, he placed her under a duke, who was sent every year from
Ravenna, and called her the duchy of Rome; while to him who remained in
Ravenna, and governed the whole of Italy for the emperor, was given the
name of Exarch. This division of the country greatly facilitated the
ruin of Italy, and gave the Lombards an early occasion of occupying it.
Narses was greatly enraged with the emperor, for having recalled him
from the government of the province, which he had won with his own valor
and blood; while Sophia, not content with the injury done by withdrawing
him, treated him in the most offensive manner, saying she wished him
to come back that he might spin with the other eunuchs. Full of
indignation, Narses persuaded Alboin, king of the Lombards, who then
reigned in Pannonia, to invade and take possession of Italy.

The Lombards, as was said before, occupied those places upon the Danube
which had been vacated by the Eruli and Turingi, when Odoacer their king
led them into Italy; where, having been established for some time, their
dominions were held by Alboin, a man ferocious and bold, under whom they
crossed the Danube, and coming to an engagement with Cunimund, king of
the Zepidi, who held Pannonia, conquered and slew him. Alboin finding
Rosamond, daughter of Cunimund, among the captives, took her to wife,
and made himself sovereign of Pannonia; and, moved by his savage nature,
caused the skull of Cunimund to be formed into a cup, from which, in
memory of the victory, he drank. Being invited into Italy by Narses,
with whom he had been in friendship during the war with the Goths, he
left Pannonia to the Huns, who after the death of Attila had returned
to their country. Finding, on his arrival, the province divided into
so many parts, he presently occupied Pavia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza, the
whole of Tuscany, and the greater part of Flamminia, which is now called
Romagna. These great and rapid acquisitions made him think the conquest
of Italy already secured; he therefore gave a great feast at Verona, and
having become elevated with wine, ordered the skull of Cunimund to be
filled, and caused it to be presented to the queen Rosamond, who sat
opposite, saying loud enough for her to hear, that upon occasion of
such great joy she should drink with her father. These words were like
a dagger to the lady's bosom and she resolved to have revenge. Knowing
that Helmichis, a noble Lombard, was in love with one of her maids, she
arranged with the young woman, that Helmichis, without being acquainted
with the fact, should sleep with her instead of his mistress. Having
effected her design, Rosamond discovered herself to Helmichis, and gave
him the choice either of killing Alboin, and taking herself and the
kingdom as his reward, or of being put to death as the ravisher of the
queen. Helmichis consented to destroy Alboin; but after the murder,
finding they could not occupy the kingdom, and fearful that the Lombards
would put them to death for the love they bore to Alboin, they seized
the royal treasure, and fled with it to Longinus, at Ravenna, who
received them favorably.

During these troubles the emperor Justinus died, and was succeeded by
Tiberius, who, occupied in the wars with the Parthians, could not attend
to the affairs of Italy; and this seeming to Longinus to present an
opportunity, by means of Rosamond and her wealth, of becoming king of
the Lombards and of the whole of Italy, he communicated his design
to her, persuaded her to destroy Helmichis, and so take him for her
husband. To this end, having prepared poisoned wine, she with her own
hand presented it to Helmichis, who complained of thirst as he came
from the bath. Having drunk half of it, he suspected the truth, from
the unusual sensation it occasioned and compelled her to drink the
remainder; so that in a few hours both came to their end, and Longinus
was deprived of the hope of becoming king.

In the meantime the Lombards, having drawn themselves together in Pavia,
which was become the principal seat of their empire, made Clefis their
king. He rebuilt Imola, destroyed by Narses, and occupied Remini
and almost every place up to Rome; but he died in the course of his
victories. Clefis was cruel to such a degree, not only toward strangers,
but to his own Lombards, that these people, sickened of royal power, did
not create another king, but appointed among themselves thirty dukes to
govern the rest. This prevented the Lombards from occupying the whole
of Italy, or of extending their dominion further than Benevento; for, of
the cities of Rome, Ravenna, Cremona, Mantua, Padua, Monselice, Parma,
Bologna, Faenza, Forli, and Cesena, some defended themselves for a time,
and others never fell under their dominion; since, not having a king,
they became less prompt for war, and when they afterward appointed one,
they were, by living in freedom, become less obedient, and more apt to
quarrel among themselves; which from the first prevented a fortunate
issue of their military expeditions, and was the ultimate cause of their
being driven out of Italy. The affairs of the Lombards being in the
state just described, the Romans and Longinus came to an agreement with
them, that each should lay down their arms and enjoy what they already
possessed.



CHAPTER III

Beginning of the greatness of the pontiffs in Italy--Abuse of censures
and indulgences--The pope applies to Pepin, king of France, for
assistance--Donation of Pepin to the pontiff--Charlemagne--End of the
kingdom of the Lombards--The title of cardinal begins to be used--The
empire passes to the Germans--Berengarius, duke of Fruili, created
king of Italy--Pisa becomes great--Order and division of the states of
Italy--Electors of the emperor created.

In these times the popes began to acquire greater temporal authority
than they had previously possessed; although the immediate successors of
St. Peter were more reverenced for the holiness of their lives, and the
miracles which they performed; and their example so greatly extended the
Christian religion, that princes of other states embraced it, in order
to obviate the confusion which prevailed at that period. The emperor
having become a Christian and returned to Constantinople, it followed,
as was remarked at the commencement of the book, that the Roman empire
was the more easily ruined, and the church more rapidly increased her
authority. Nevertheless, the whole of Italy, being subject either to the
emperors or the kings till the coming of the Lombards, the popes never
acquired any greater authority than what reverence for their habits and
doctrine gave them. In other respects they obeyed the emperors or kings;
officiated for them in their affairs, as ministers or agents, and were
even sometimes put to death by them. He who caused them to become of
more importance in the affairs of Italy, was Theodoric, king of the
Goths, when he established the seat of his empire at Ravenna; for, Rome
being without a prince, the Romans found it necessary, for their safety,
to yield obedience to the pope; his authority, however, was not greatly
increased thereby, the only advantage being, that the church of Rome was
allowed to take precedence of that of Ravenna. But the Lombards having
taken possession, and Italy being divided into many parts, the pope had
an opportunity of greater exertion. Being as it were the head of Rome,
both the emperor of Constantinople and the Lombards respected him; so
that the Romans, by his means, entered into league with the Lombards,
and with Longinus, not as subjects, but as equals. Thus the popes,
at one time friends of the Greeks, and at another of the Lombards,
increased their own power; but upon the ruin of the eastern empire,
which occurred during the time of Heraclius, their influence was
reduced; for the Sclavi, of whom we spoke before, again assailed
Illyria, and having occupied the country, named it Sclavonia, after
themselves; and the other parts were attacked by the Persians, then by
the Saracens under Mohammed, and lastly by the Turks, who took Syria,
Africa, and Egypt. These causes induced the reigning pope, in his
distress, to seek new friends, and he applied to the king of France.
Nearly all the wars which the northern barbarians carried on in Italy,
it may be here remarked, were occasioned by the pontiffs; and the
hordes, with which the country was inundated, were generally called in
by them. The same mode of proceeding still continued, and kept Italy
weak and unsettled. And, therefore, in relating the events which have
taken place from those times to the present, the ruin of the empire will
be no longer illustrated, but only the increase of the pontificate and
of the other principalities which ruled Italy till the coming of Charles
VIII. It will be seen how the popes, first with censures, and afterward
with these and arms, mingled with indulgences, became both terrible and
venerable; and how, from having abused both, they ceased to possess
any influence, and were wholly dependent on the will of others for
assistance in their wars.

But to return to the order of our narration. Gregory III. occupied the
papacy, and the kingdom of the Lombards was held by Astolphus, who,
contrary to agreement, seized Ravenna, and made war upon the pope.
On this account, Gregory no longer relying upon the emperor of
Constantinople, since he, for the reasons above given, was unable to
assist him, and unwilling to trust the Lombards, for they had frequently
broken their faith, had recourse to Pepin II., who, from being lord of
Austria and Brabant, had become king of France; not so much by his
own valor as by that of Charles Martel, his father, and Pepin his
grandfather; for Charles Martel, being governor of the kingdom, effected
the memorable defeat of the Saracens near Tours, upon the Loire, in
which two hundred thousand of them are said to have been left dead upon
the field of battle. Hence, Pepin, by his father's reputation and his
own abilities, became afterward king of France. To him Pope Gregory, as
we have said, applied for assistance against the Lombards, which Pepin
promised to grant, but desired first to see him and be honored with his
presence. Gregory accordingly went to France, passing uninjured through
the country of his enemies, so great was the respect they had for
religion, and was treated honorably by Pepin, who sent an army into
Italy, and besieged the Lombards in Pavia. King Astolphus, compelled by
necessity, made proposals of peace to the French, who agreed to them at
the entreaty of the pope--for he did not desire the death of his enemy,
but that he should be converted and live. In this treaty, Astolphus
promised to give to the church all the places he had taken from her;
but the king's forces having returned to France, he did not fulfill the
agreement, and the pope again had recourse to Pepin, who sent another
army, conquered the Lombards, took Ravenna, and, contrary to the wishes
of the Greek emperor, gave it to the pope, with all the places that
belonged to the exarchate, and added to them Urbino and the Marca.
But Astolphus, while fulfilling the terms of his agreement, died, and
Desiderius, a Lombard, who was duke of Tuscany, took up arms to occupy
the kingdom, and demanded assistance of the pope, promising him
his friendship. The pope acceding to his request, the other princes
assented. Desiderius kept faith at first, and proceeded to resign the
districts to the pope, according to the agreement made with Pepin, so
that an exarch was no longer sent from Constantinople to Ravenna, but it
was governed according to the will of the pope. Pepin soon after died,
and was succeeded by his son Charles, the same who, on account of the
magnitude and success of his enterprises, was called Charlemagne, or
Charles the Great. Theodore I. now succeeded to the papacy, and discord
arising between him and Desiderius, the latter besieged him in Rome.
The pope requested assistance of Charles, who, having crossed the Alps,
besieged Desiderius in Pavai, where he took both him and his children,
and sent them prisoners to France. He then went to visit the pontiff at
Rome, where he declared, THAT THE POPE, BEING VICAR OF GOD, COULD NOT
BE JUDGED BY MEN. The pope and the people of Rome made him emperor; and
thus Rome began to have an emperor of the west. And whereas the popes
used to be established by the emperors, the latter now began to have
need of the popes at their elections; the empire continued to lose
its powers, while the church acquired them; and, by these means, she
constantly extended her authority over temporal princes.

The Lombards, having now been two hundred and thirty-two years in the
country, were strangers only in name, and Charles, wishing to reorganize
the states of Italy, consented that they should occupy the places in
which they had been brought up, and call the province after their own
name, Lombardy. That they might be led to respect the Roman name, he
ordered all that part of Italy adjoining to them, which had been under
the exarchate of Ravenna, to be called Romagna. Besides this, he created
his son Pepin, king of Italy, whose dominion extended to Benevento; all
the rest being possessed by the Greek emperor, with whom Charles was
in league. About this time Pascal I. occupied the pontificate, and
the priests of the churches of Rome, from being near to the pope, and
attending the elections of the pontiff, began to dignify their own power
with a title, by calling themselves cardinals, and arrogated so great
authority, that having excluded the people of Rome from the election
of pontiff, the appointment of a new pope was scarcely ever made except
from one of their own number: thus on the death of Pascal, the cardinal
of St. Sabina was created pope by the title of Eugenius II. Italy having
come into the hands of the French, a change of form and order took
place, the popes acquiring greater temporal power, and the new
authorities adopting the titles of count and marquis, as that of duke
had been introduced by Longinus, exarch of Ravenna. After the deaths of
some pontiffs, Osporco, a Roman, succeeded to the papacy; but on account
of his unseemly appellation, he took the name of Sergius, and this was
the origin of that change of names which the popes adopt upon their
election to the pontificate.

In the meantime, the Emperor Charles died and was succeeded by Lewis
(the Pious), after whose death so many disputes arose among his sons,
that at the time of his grandchildren, the house of France lost the
empire, which then came to the Germans; the first German emperor being
called Arnolfus. Nor did the Carlovingian family lose the empire only;
their discords also occasioned them the loss of Italy; for the Lombards,
gathering strength, offended the pope and the Romans, and Arnolfo, not
knowing where to seek relief, was compelled to create Berengarius, duke
of Fruili, king of Italy. These events induced the Huns, who occupied
Pannonia, to assail Italy; but, in an engagement with Berengarius, they
were compelled to return to Pannonia, which had from them been named
Hungary.

Romano was at this time emperor of Greece, having, while prefect of
the army, dethroned Constantine; and as Puglia and Calabria, which, as
before observed, were parts of the Greek empire, had revolted, he
gave permission to the Saracans to occupy them; and they having taken
possession of these provinces, besieged Rome. The Romans, Berengarius
being then engaged in defending himself against the Huns, appointed
Alberic, duke of Tuscany, their leader. By his valor Rome was saved from
the Saracens, who, withdrawing from the siege, erected a fortress upon
Mount Gargano, by means of which they governed Puglia and Calabria,
and harassed the whole country. Thus Italy was in those times very
grievously afflicted, being in constant warfare with the Huns in the
direction of the Alps, and, on the Neapolitan side, suffering from the
inroads of the Saracens. This state of things continued many years,
occupying the reigns of three Berengarii, who succeeded each other; and
during this time the pope and the church were greatly disturbed; the
impotence of the eastern, and the disunion which prevailed among the
western princes, leaving them without defense. The city of Genoa, with
all her territory upon the rivers, having been overrun by the Saracens,
an impulse was thus given to the rising greatness of Pisa, in which city
multitudes took refuge who had been driven out of their own country.
These events occurred in the year 931, when Otho, duke of Saxony, the
son of Henry and Matilda, a man of great prudence and reputation, being
made emperor, the pope Agapito, begged that he would come into Italy and
relieve him from the tyranny of the Berengarii.

The States of Italy were governed in this manner: Lombardy was under
Berengarius III. and Alfred his son; Tuscany and Romagna were governed
by a deputy of the western emperor; Puglia and Calabria were partly
under the Greek emperor, and partly under the Saracens; in Rome two
consuls were annually chosen from the nobility, who governed her
according to ancient custom; to these was added a prefect, who dispensed
justice among the people; and there was a council of twelve, who each
year appointed rectors for the places subject to them. The popes had
more or less authority in Rome and the rest of Italy, in proportion as
they were favorites of the emperor or of the most powerful states. The
Emperor Otho came into Italy, took the kingdom from the Berengarii, in
which they had reigned fifty-five years, and reinstated the pontiff in
his dignity. He had a son and a nephew, each named Otho, who, one after
the other, succeeded to the empire. In the reign of Otho III., Pope
Gregory V. was expelled by the Romans; whereupon the emperor came into
Italy and replaced him; and the pope, to revenge himself on the Romans,
took from them the right to create an emperor, and gave it to three
princes and three bishops of Germany; the princes of Brandenburg,
Palatine, and Saxony, and the bishops of Magonza, Treveri, and Colonia.
This occurred in the year 1002. After the death of Otho III. the
electors created Henry, duke of Bavaria, emperor, who at the end of
twelve years was crowned by Pope Stephen VIII. Henry and his wife
Simeonda were persons of very holy life, as is seen by the many temples
built and endowed by them, of which the church of St. Miniato, near
Florence, is one. Henry died in 1024, and was succeeded by Conrad of
Suabia; and the latter by Henry II., who came to Rome; and as there was
a schism in the church of three popes, he set them all aside, and caused
the election of Clement II., by whom he was crowned emperor.



CHAPTER IV

Nicholas II. commits the election of the pope to the cardinals--First
example of a prince deprived of his dominions by the pope--Guelphs and
Ghibellines--Establishment of the kingdom of Naples--Pope Urban II. goes
to France--The first crusade--New orders of knighthood--Saladin takes
from the Christians their possessions in the east--Death of the Countess
Matilda--Character of Frederick Barbarossa--Schism--Frederick creates
an anti-pope--Building of Alexandria in Puglia--Disgraceful conditions
imposed by the pope upon Henry, king of England--Reconciliation
of Frederick with the pope--The kingdom of Naples passes to the
Germans--Orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis.

Italy was at this time governed partly by the people, some districts
by their own princes, and others by the deputies of the emperor. The
highest in authority, and to whom the others referred, was called the
chancellor. Of the princes, the most powerful were Godfred and the
Countess Matilda his wife, who was daughter of Beatrice, the sister of
Henry II. She and her husband possessed Lucca, Parma, Reggio, Mantua,
and the whole of what is now called THE PATRIMONY OF THE CHURCH. The
ambition of the Roman people caused many wars between them and the
pontiffs, whose authority had previously been used to free them from
the emperors; but when they had taken the government of the city to
themselves, and regulated it according to their own pleasure, they at
once became at enmity with the popes, who received far more injuries
from them than from any Christian potentate. And while the popes caused
all the west to tremble with their censures, the people of Rome were
in open rebellion against them; nor had they or the popes any other
purpose, but to deprive each other of reputation and authority.

Nicholas II. now attained the papacy; and as Gregory V. had taken
from the Romans the right to create an emperor, he in the same manner
determined to deprive them of their share in the election of the pope;
and confined the creation to the cardinals alone. Nor did this satisfy
him; for, having agreed with the princes who governed Calabria and
Puglia, with methods which we shall presently relate, he compelled the
officers whom the Romans appointed to their different jurisdictions,
to render obedience to him; and some of them he even deprived of their
offices. After the death of Nicholas, there was a schism in the church;
the clergy of Lombardy refused obedience to Alexander II., created at
Rome, and elected Cadolo of Parma anti-pope; and Henry, who hated
the power of the pontiffs, gave Alexander to understand that he must
renounce the pontificate, and ordered the cardinals to go into Germany
to appoint a new pope. He was the first who felt the importance of
spiritual weapons; for the pope called a council at Rome, and deprived
Henry of both the empire and the kingdom. Some of the people of Italy
took the part of the pope, others of Henry; and hence arose the factions
of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines; that Italy, relieved from the
inundations of barbarians, might be distracted with intestine strife.
Henry, being excommunicated, was compelled by his people to come into
Italy, and fall barefooted upon his knees before the pope, and ask his
pardon. This occurred in the year 1082. Nevertheless, there shortly
afterward arose new discords between the pope and Henry; upon which the
pope again excommunicated him, and the emperor sent his son, also named
Henry, with an army to Rome, and he, with the assistance of the Romans,
who hated the pope, besieged him in the fortress. Robert Guiscard them
came from Puglia to his relief, but Henry had left before his arrival,
and returned to Germany. The Romans stood out alone, and the city was
sacked by Robert, and reduced to ruins. As from this Robert sprung the
establishment of the kingdom of Naples, it seems not superfluous to
relate particularly his actions and origin.

Disunion having arisen among the descendants of Charlemagne, occasion
was given to another northern people, called Normans, to assail France
and occupy that portion of the country which is now named Normandy. A
part of these people came into Italy at the time when the province was
infested with the Berengarii, the Saracans, and the Huns, and occupied
some places in Romagna, where, during the wars of that period, they
conducted themselves valiantly. Tancred, one of these Norman princes,
had many children; among the rest were William, surnamed Ferabac, and
Robert, called Guiscard. When the principality was governed by William,
the troubles of Italy were in some measure abated; but the Saracens
still held Sicily, and plundered the coasts of Italy daily. On this
account William arranged with the princes of Capua and Salerno, and
with Melorco, a Greek, who governed Puglia and Calabria for the
Greek emperor, to attack Sicily; and it was agreed that, if they
were victorious, each should have a fourth part of the booty and
the territory. They were fortunate in their enterprise, expelled the
Saracens, and took possession of the island; but, after the victory,
Melorco secretly caused forces to be brought from Greece, seized Sicily
in the name of the emperor, and appropriated the booty to himself and
his followers. William was much dissatisfied with this, but reserved
the exhibition of his displeasure for a suitable opportunity, and left
Sicily with the princes of Salerno and Capua. But when they had parted
from him to return to their homes, instead of proceeding to Romagna he
led his people towards Puglia, and took Melfi; and from thence, in a
short time, recovered from the Greek emperor almost the whole of Puglia
and Calabria, over which provinces, in the time of pope Nicholas II. his
brother Robert Guiscard was sovereign. Robert having had many disputes
with his nephews for the inheritance of these states, requested the
influence of the pope to settle them; which his holiness was very
willing to afford, being anxious to make a friend of Robert, to defend
himself against the emperor of Germany and the insolence of the Roman
people, which indeed shortly followed, when, at the instance of Gregory,
he drove Henry from Rome, and subdued the people. Robert was succeeded
by his sons Roger and William, to whose dominion not only was Naples
added, but all the places interjacent as far as Rome, and afterward
Sicily, of which Roger became sovereign; but, upon William going to
Constantinople, to marry the daughter of the emperor, his dominions
were wrested from him by his brother Roger. Inflated with so great an
acquisition, Roger first took the title of king of Italy, but afterward
contented himself with that of king of Puglia and Sicily. He was the
first who established and gave that name to this kingdom, which still
retains its ancient boundaries, although its sovereigns have been of
many families and countries. Upon the failure of the Normans, it came to
the Germans, after these to the French, then to the Aragonese, and it is
now held by the Flemish.

About this time Urban II. became pope and excited the hatred of the
Romans. As he did not think himself safe even in Italy, on account of
the disunion which prevailed, he directed his thoughts to a generous
enterprise. With his whole clergy he went into France, and at Anvers,
having drawn together a vast multitude of people, delivered an oration
against the infidels, which so excited the minds of his audience, that
they determined to undertake the conquest of Asia from the Saracens;
which enterprise, with all those of a similar nature, were afterward
called crusades, because the people who joined in them bore upon their
armor and apparel the figure of a cross. The leaders were Godfrey,
Eustace, and Baldwin of Bouillon, counts of Boulogne, and Peter, a
hermit celebrated for his prudence and sagacity. Many kings and people
joined them, and contributed money; and many private persons fought
under them at their own expense; so great was the influence of religion
in those days upon the minds of men, excited by the example of those
who were its principal ministers. The proudest successes attended the
beginning of this enterprise; for the whole of Asia Minor, Syria, and
part of Egypt, fell under the power of the Christians. To commemorate
these events the order of the Knights of Jerusalem was created, which
still continues, and holds the island of Rhodes--the only obstacle to
the power of the Mohammedans. The same events gave rise to the order
of the Knights Templars, which, after a short time, on account of
their shameless practices, was dissolved. Various fortunes attended
the crusaders in the course of their enterprises, and many nations
and individuals became celebrated accordingly. The kings of France
and England joined them, and, with the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese,
acquired great reputation, till the time of Saladin, when, by whose
talents, and the disagreement of the Christians among themselves,
the crusaders were robbed of all that glory which they had at first
acquired; and, after ninety years, were driven from those places which
they had so honorably and happily recovered.

After the death of Urban, Pascal II. became pope, and the empire was
under the dominion of Henry IV. who came to Rome pretending friendship
for the pontiff but afterward put his holiness and all his clergy in
prison; nor did he release them till it was conceded that he should
dispose of the churches of Germany according to his own pleasure. About
this time, the Countess Matilda died, and made the church heir to all
her territories. After the deaths of Pascal and Henry IV. many popes and
emperors followed, till the papacy was occupied by Alexander III. and
the empire by Frederick, surnamed Barbarossa. The popes during this
period had met with many difficulties from the people of Rome and
the emperors; and in the time of Barbarossa they were much increased.
Frederick possessed military talent, but was so full of pride that he
would not submit to the pontiff. However, at his election to the empire
he came to Rome to be crowned, and returned peaceably to Germany, where
he did not long remain in the same mind, but came again into Italy to
subdue certain places in Lombardy, which did not obey him. It happened
at this time that the cardinal St. Clement, of a Roman family, separated
from Alexander, and was made pope by some of the cardinals. The Emperor
Frederick, being encamped at Cerma, Alexander complained to him of the
anti-pope, and received for answer, that they were both to go to him,
and, having heard each side, he would determine which was the true pope.
This reply displeased Alexander; and, as he saw the emperor was inclined
to favor the anti-pope, he excommunicated him, and then fled to Philip,
king of France. Frederick, in the meantime, carrying on the war in
Lombardy, destroyed Milan; which caused the union of Verona, Padua, and
Vicenza against him for their common defense. About the same period the
anti-pope died, and Frederick set up Guido of Cremona, in his stead.

The Romans, from the absence of the pope, and from the emperor being
in Lombardy, had reacquired some authority in Rome, and proceeded to
recover the obedience of those places which had been subject to them.
And as the people of Tusculum refused to submit to their authority, they
proceeded against them with their whole force; but these, being assisted
by Frederick, routed the Roman army with such dreadful slaughter,
that Rome was never after either so populous or so rich. Alexander now
returned to the city, thinking he could be safe there on account of
the enmity subsisting between the Romans and the emperor, and from the
enemies which the latter had in Lombardy. But Frederick, setting aside
every other consideration, led his forces and encamped before Rome; and
Alexander fled to William, king of Puglia, who had become hair of that
kingdom after the death of Roger. Frederick, however, withdrew from Rome
on account of the plague which then prevailed, and returned to Germany.
The cities of Lombardy in league against him, in order to command Pavia
and Tortona, which adhered to the imperial party, built a city, to be
their magazine in time of war, and named in Alexandria, in honor of the
pope and in contempt of Frederick.

Guido the anti-pope died, and Giovanni of Fermo was appointed in his
stead, who, being favored by the imperialists, lived at Montefiascone.
Pope Alexander being at Tusculum, whither he had been called by the
inhabitants, that with his authority he might defend them from the
Romans, ambassadors came to him from Henry, king of England, to signify
that he was not blamable for the death of Thomas à Becket, archbishop
of Canterbury, although public report had slandered him with it. On this
the pope sent two cardinals to England, to inquire into the truth of
the matter; and although they found no actual charge against the king,
still, on account of the infamy of the crime, and for not having honored
the archbishop so much as he deserved, the sentence against the king of
England was, that having called together the barons of his empire,
he should upon oath before them affirm his innocence; that he should
immediately send two hundred soldiers to Jerusalem, paid for one year;
that, before the end of three years, he should himself proceed thither
with as large an army as he could draw together; that his subjects
should have the power of appealing to Rome when they thought proper;
and that he should annul whatever acts had been passed in his kingdom
unfavorable to ecclesiastical rule. These terms were all accepted by
Henry; and thus a great king submitted to a sentence that in our day a
private person would have been ashamed of. But while the pope exercised
so great authority over distant princes, he could not compel obedience
from the Romans themselves, or obtain their consent that he should
remain in Rome, even though he promised to intermeddle only with
ecclesiastical affairs.

About this time Frederick returned to Italy, and while he was preparing
to carry on new wars against the pope, his prelates and barons declared
that they would abandon him unless he reconciled himself with the
church; so that he was obliged to go and submit to the pope at Venus,
where a pacification was effected, but in which the pope deprived the
emperor of all authority over Rome, and named William, king of Sicily
and Puglia, a coadjutor with him. Frederick, unable to exist without
war, joined the crusaders in Asia, that he might exercise that ambition
against Mohammed, which he could not gratify against the vicars of
Christ. And being near the river Cydnus, tempted by the clearness of
its waters, bathed therein, took cold, and died. Thus the river did a
greater favor to the Mohammedans than the pope's excommunications had
done to the Christians; for the latter only checked his pride, while the
former finished his career. Frederick being dead, the pope had now
only to suppress the contumacy of the Romans; and, after many disputes
concerning the creation of consuls, it was agreed that they should
elect them as they had been accustomed to do, but that these should not
undertake the office, till they had first sworn to be faithful to the
church. This agreement being made, Giovanni the anti-pope took refuge in
Mount Albano, where he shortly afterward died. William, king of Naples,
died about the same time, and the pope intended to occupy that kingdom
on the ground that the king had left only a natural son named Tancred.
But the barons would not consent, and wished that Tancred should be
king. Celestine III., the then pope, anxious to snatch the kingdom from
the hands of Tancred, contrived that Henry, son of Frederick should be
elected emperor, and promised him the kingdom on the condition that he
should restore to the church all the places that had belonged to her. To
facilitate this affair, he caused Gostanza, a daughter of William, who
had been placed in a monastery and was now old, to be brought from
her seclusion and become the wife of Henry. Thus the kingdom of Naples
passed from the Normans, who had been the founders of it, to the
Germans. As soon as the affairs of Germany were arranged, the Emperor
Henry came into Italy with Gostanza his wife, and a son about four years
of age named Frederick; and, as Tancred was now dead, leaving only
an infant named Roger, he took possession of the kingdom without much
difficulty. After some years, Henry died in Sicily, and was succeeded in
the kingdom by Frederick, and in the empire by Otho, duke of Saxony, who
was elected through the influence of Innocent III. But as soon as he had
taken the crown, contrary to the general expectation, he became an enemy
of the pope, occupied Romagna, and prepared to attack the kingdom. On
this account the pope excommunicated him; he was abandoned by every one,
and the electors appointed Frederick, king of Naples, emperor in his
stead. Frederick came to Rome for his coronation; but the pope, being
afraid of his power, would not crown him, and endeavored to withdraw him
from Italy as he had done Otho. Frederick returned to Germany in anger,
and, after many battles with Otho, at length conquered him. Meanwhile,
Innocent died, who, besides other excellent works, built the hospital of
the Holy Ghost at Rome. He was succeeded by Honorius III., in whose time
the religious orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis were founded, 1218.
Honorius crowned Frederick, to whom Giovanni, descended from Baldwin,
king of Jerusalem, who commanded the remainder of the Christian army in
Asia and still held that title, gave a daughter in marriage; and, with
her portion, conceded to him the title to that kingdom: hence it is that
every king of Naples is called king of Jerusalem.



CHAPTER V

The state of Italy--Beginning of the greatness of the house of
Este--Guelphs and Ghibellines--Death of the Emperor Frederick
II.--Manfred takes possession of the kingdom of Naples--Movements of the
Guelphs and Ghibellines in Lombardy--Charles of Anjou invested by the
pope with the kingdom of Naples and Sicily--Restless policy of
the popes--Ambitious views of pope Nicholas III.--Nephews of the
popes--Sicilian vespers--The Emperor Rodolph allows many cities to
purchase their independence--Institution of the jubilee--The popes at
Avignon.

At this time the states of Italy were governed in the following manner:
the Romans no longer elected consuls, but instead of them, and with the
same powers, they appointed one senator, and sometimes more. The league
which the cities of Lombardy had formed against Frederick Barbarossa
still continued, and comprehended Milan, Brescia, Mantua, and the
greater number of the cities of Romagna, together with Verona, Vicenza,
Padua, and Trevisa. Those which took part with the emperor, were
Cremona, Bergamo, Parma, Reggio, and Trento. The other cities and
fortresses of Lombardy, Romagna, and the march of Trevisa, favored,
according to their necessities, sometimes one party, sometimes the
other.

In the time of Otho III. there had come into Italy a man called Ezelin,
who, remaining in the country, had a son, and he too had a son named
Ezelin. This person, being rich and powerful, took part with Frederick,
who, as we have said, was at enmity with the pope; Frederick, at the
instigation and with the assistance of Ezelin, took Verona and Mantua,
destroyed Vicenza, occupied Padua, routed the army of the united cities,
and then directed his course towards Tuscany. Ezelin, in the meantime,
had subdued the whole of the Trevisian March, but could not prevail
against Ferrara, which was defended by Azone da Este and the forces
which the pope had in Lombardy; and, as the enemy were compelled to
withdraw, the pope gave Ferrara in fee to this Azone, from whom are
descended those who now govern that city. Frederick halted at Pisa,
desirous of making himself lord of Tuscany; but, while endeavoring to
discover what friends and foes he had in that province, he scattered so
many seeds of discord as occasioned the ruin of Italy; for the factions
of the Guelphs and Ghibellines multiplied,--those who supported the
church taking the name of Guelphs, while the followers of the emperor
were called Ghibellines, these names being first heard at Pistoia.
Frederick, marching from Pisa, assailed and wasted the territories
of the church in a variety of ways; so that the pope, having no other
remedy, unfurled against him the banner of the cross, as his predecessor
had done against the Saracens. Frederick, that he might be suddenly
abandoned by his people, as Frederick Barbarossa and others had been,
took into his pay a number of Saracens; and to bind them to him, and
establish in Italy a firm bulwark against the church, without fear of
papal maledictions, he gave them Nocera in the kingdom of Naples, that,
having a refuge of their own, they might be placed in greater security.
The pontificate was now occupied by Innocent IV., who, being in fear
of Frederick, went to Genoa, and thence to France, where he appointed a
council to be held at Lyons, where it was the intention of Frederick
to attend, but he was prevented by the rebellion of Parma: and, being
repulsed, he went into Tuscany, and from thence to Sicily, where he
died, leaving his son Conrad in Suabia; and in Puglia, Manfred, whom he
had created duke of Benevento, born of a concubine. Conrad came to take
possession of the kingdom, and having arrived at Naples, died, leaving
an infant son named Corradino, who was then in Germany. On this
account Manfred occupied the state, first as guardian of Corradino, but
afterward, causing a report to be circulated that Corradino had died,
made himself king, contrary to the wishes of both the pope and the
Neapolitans, who, however, were obliged to submit.

While these things were occurring in the kingdom of Naples, many
movements took place in Lombardy between the Guelphs and the
Ghibellines. The Guelphs were headed by a legate of the pope; and the
Ghibelline party by Ezelin, who possessed nearly the whole of Lombardy
beyond the Po; and, as in the course of the war Padua rebelled, he
put to death twelve thousand of its citizens. But before its close he
himself was slain, in the eightieth year of his age, and all the places
he had held became free. Manfred, king of Naples, continued those
enmities against the church which had been begun by his ancestors,
and kept the pope, Urban IV., in continual alarm; so that, in order to
subdue him, Urban summoned the crusaders, and went to Perugia to await
their arrival. Seeing them few and slow in their approach, he found
that more able assistance was necessary to conquer Manfred. He therefore
sought the favor of France; created Louis of Anjou, the king's brother,
sovereign of Naples and Sicily, and excited him to come into Italy to
take possession of that kingdom. But before Charles came to Rome the
pope died, and was succeeded by Clement IV., in whose time he arrived
at Ostia, with thirty galleys, and ordered that the rest of his forces
should come by land. During his abode at Rome, the citizens, in order
to attach him to them, made him their senator, and the pope invested him
with the kingdom, on condition that he should pay annually to the
church the sum of fifty thousand ducats; and it was decreed that, from
thenceforth, neither Charles nor any other person, who might be king of
Naples, should be emperor also. Charles marched against Manfred, routed
his army, and slew him near Benevento, and then became sovereign of
Sicily and Naples. Corradino, to whom, by his father's will, the state
belonged, having collected a great force in Germany, marched into Italy
against Charles, with whom he came to an engagement at Tagliacozzo, was
taken prisoner while endeavoring to escape, and being unknown, put to
death.

Italy remained in repose until the pontificate of Adrian V. Charles,
being at Rome and governing the city by virtue of his office of senator,
the pope, unable to endure his power, withdrew to Viterbo, and solicited
the Emperor Rodolph to come into Italy and assist him. Thus the popes,
sometimes in zeal for religion, at others moved by their own ambition,
were continually calling in new parties and exciting new disturbances.
As soon as they had made a prince powerful, they viewed him with
jealousy and sought his ruin; and never allowed another to rule the
country, which, from their own imbecility, they were themselves unable
to govern. Princes were in fear of them; for, fighting or running away,
the popes always obtained the advantage, unless it happened they were
entrapped by deceit, as occurred to Boniface VIII., and some others, who
under pretense of friendship, were ensnared by the emperors. Rodolph did
not come into Italy, being detained by the war in which he was engaged
with the king of Bohemia. At this time Adrian died, and Nicholas III.,
of the Orsini family, became pontiff. He was a bold, ambitious man; and
being resolved at any event to diminish the power of Charles, induced
the Emperor Rodolph to complain that he had a governor in Tuscany
favorable to the Guelphic faction, who after the death of Manfred had
been replaced by him. Charles yielded to the emperor and withdrew his
governor, and the pope sent one of his nephews, a cardinal, as governor
for the emperor, who, for the honor done him, restored Romagna to the
church, which had been taken from her by his predecessors, and the pope
made Bertoldo Orsino duke of Romagna. As Nicholas now thought himself
powerful enough to oppose Charles, he deprived him of the office of
senator, and made a decree that no one of royal race should ever be a
senator in Rome. It was his intention to deprive Charles of Sicily, and
to this end he entered into a secret negotiation with Peter, king of
Aragon, which took effect in the following papacy. He also had the
design of creating two kings out of his family, the one in Lombardy, the
other in Tuscany, whose power would defend the church from the Germans
who might design to come into Italy, and from the French, who were in
the kingdom of Naples and Sicily. But with these thoughts he died. He
was the first pope who openly exhibited his own ambition; and, under
pretense of making the church great, conferred honors and emolument upon
his own family. Previous to his time no mention is made of the nephews
or families of any pontiff, but future history is full of them; nor is
there now anything left for them to attempt, except the effort to make
the papacy hereditary. True it is, the princes of their creating have
not long sustained their honors; for the pontiffs, being generally of
very limited existence, did not get their plants properly established.

To Nicholas succeeded Martin IV., of French origin, and consequently
favorable to the party of Charles, who sent him assistance against
the rebellion of Romagna; and while they were encamped at Furli, Guido
Bonatto, an astrologer, contrived that at an appointed moment the people
should assail the forces of the king, and the plan succeeding, all the
French were taken and slain. About this period was also carried into
effect the plot of Pope Nicholas and Peter, king of Aragon, by which the
Sicilians murdered all the French that were in that island; and Peter
made himself sovereign of it, saying, that it belonged to him in the
right of his wife Gostanza, daughter of Manfred. But Charles, while
making warlike preparations for the recovery of Sicily, died, leaving
a son, Charles II., who was made prisoner in Sicily, and to recover his
liberty promised to return to his prison, if within three years he
did not obtain the pope's consent that the kings of Aragon should be
invested with the kingdom of Sicily.

The Emperor Rodolph, instead of coming into Italy, gave the empire the
advantage of having done so, by sending an ambassador, with authority
to make all those cities free which would redeem themselves with money.
Many purchased their freedom, and with liberty changed their mode of
living. Adolpho of Saxony succeeded to the empire; and to the papacy,
Pietro del Murrone, who took the name of Celestino; but, being a hermit
and full of sanctity, after six months renounced the pontificate, and
Boniface VIII. was elected.

After a time the French and Germans left Italy, and the country remained
wholly in the hands of the Italians; but Providence ordained that the
pope, when these enemies were withdrawn, should neither establish nor
enjoy his authority, and raised two very powerful families in Rome,
the Colonnesi and the Orsini, who with their arms, and the proximity
of their abode, kept the pontificate weak. Boniface then determined
to destroy the Colonnesi, and, besides excommunicating, endeavored to
direct the weapons of the church against them. This, although it did
them some injury, proved more disastrous to the pope; for those arms
which from attachment to the faith performed valiantly against its
enemies, as soon as they were directed against Christians for private
ambition, ceased to do the will of those who wished to wield them. And
thus the too eager desire to gratify themselves, caused the pontiffs by
degrees to lose their military power. Besides what is just related, the
pope deprived two cardinals of the Colonnesi family of their office; and
Sciarra, the head of the house, escaping unknown, was taken by corsairs
of Catalonia and put to the oar; but being afterward recognized
at Marseilles, he was sent to Philip, king of France, who had been
excommunicated and deprived of the kingdom. Philip, considering that
in a war against the pontiff he would either be a loser or run great
hazards, had recourse to deception, and simulating a wish to come to
terms, secretly sent Sciarra into Italy, who, having arrived at Anagnia,
where his holiness then resided, assembled a few friends, and in the
night took him prisoner. And although the people of Anagnia set him
at liberty shortly after, yet from grief at the injury he died mad.
Boniface was founder of the jubilee in 1300, and fixed that it should
be celebrated at each revolution of one hundred years. In those times
various troubles arose between the Guelph and Ghibelline factions; and
the emperors having abandoned Italy, many places became free, and many
were occupied by tyrants. Pope Benedict restored the scarlet hat to the
cardinals of the Colonnesi family, and reblessed Philip, king of France.
He was succeeded by Clement V., who, being a Frenchman, removed the
papal court to Avignon in 1305.

the Venetians.

At this time, Charles II. of Naples died, and was succeeded by his son
Robert. Henry of Luxemburg had been elected to the empire, and came to
Rome for his coronation, although the pope was not there. His coming
occasioned great excitement in Lombardy; for he sent all the banished
to their homes, whether they were Guelphs or Ghibellines; and in
consequence of this, one faction endeavoring to drive out the other, the
whole province was filled with war; nor could the emperor with all his
endeavors abate its fury. Leaving Lombardy by way of Genoa, he came
to Pisa, where he endeavored to take Tuscany from King Robert; but not
being successful, he went to Rome, where he remained only a few days,
being driven away by the Orsini with the consent of King Robert, and
returned to Pisa; and that he might more securely make war upon Tuscany,
and wrest the country from the hands of the king, he caused it to be
assailed by Frederick, monarch of Sicily. But when he was in hope of
occupying Tuscany and robbing the king of Naples of his dominions, he
died, and was succeeded by Louis of Bavaria. About the same period, John
XXII. attained the papacy, during whose time the emperor still continued
to persecute the Guelphs and the church, but they were defended by
Robert and the Florentines. Many wars took place in Lombardy between the
Visconti and the Guelphs, and in Tuscany between Castruccio of Lucca
and the Florentines. As the family of Visconti gave rise to the duchy of
Milan, one of the five principalities which afterward governed Italy, I
shall speak of them from a rather earlier date.

Milan, upon recovering from the ruin into which she had been thrown by
Frederick Barbarossa, in revenge for her injuries, joined the league
formed by the Lombard cities for their common defense; this restrained
him, and for awhile preserved alive the interests of the church in
Lombardy. In the course of the wars which followed, the family of La
Torre became very potent in that city, and their reputation increased
so long as the emperor possessed little authority in the province.
But Frederick II. coming into Italy, and the Ghibelline party, by the
influence of Ezelin having grown powerful, seeds of the same faction
sprang up in all the cities. In Milan were the Visconti, who expelled
the La Torres; these, however, did not remain out, for by agreement
between the emperor and the pope they were restored to their country.
For when the pope and his court removed to France, and the emperor,
Henry of Luxemburg, came into Italy, with the pretext of going to Rome
for his crown, he was received in Milan by Maffeo Visconti and Guido
della Torre, who were then the heads of these families. But Maffeo,
designing to make use of the emperor for the purpose of expelling Guido,
and thinking the enterprise not difficult, on account of the La Torre
being of the contrary faction to the imperial, took occasion, from the
remarks which the people made of the uncivil behavior of the Germans,
to go craftily about and excite the populace to arm themselves and throw
off the yoke of these barbarians. When a suitable moment arrived, he
caused a person in whom he confided to create a tumult, upon which the
people took arms against the Germans. But no sooner was the mischief
well on foot, than Maffeo, with his sons and their partisans, ran to
Henry, telling him that all the disturbance had been occasioned by the
La Torre family, who, not content to remain peaceably in Milan, had
taken the opportunity to plunder him, that they might ingratiate
themselves with the Guelphs of Italy and become princes in the city;
they then bade him be of good cheer, for they, with their party,
whenever he wished it, were ready to defend him with their lives. Henry,
believing all that Maffeo told him, joined his forces to those of the
Visconti, and attacking the La Torre, who were in various parts of the
city endeavoring to quell the tumult, slew all upon whom they could lay
hands, and having plundered the others of their property, sent them into
exile. By this artifice, Maffeo Visconti became a prince of Milan. Of
him remained Galeazzo and Azzo; and, after these, Luchino and Giovanni.
Giovanni became archbishop of Milan; and of Luchino, who died before
him, were left Bernabo and Galeazzo; Galeazzo, dying soon after, left
a son called the Count of Virtu, who after the death of the archbishop,
contrived the murder of his uncle, Bernabo, became prince of Milan,
and was the first who had the title of duke. The duke left Filippo and
Giovanmaria Angelo, the latter of whom being slain by the people of
Milan, the state fell to Filippo; but he having no male heir, Milan
passed from the family of Visconti to that of Sforza, in the manner to
be related hereafter.

But to return to the point from which we deviated. The Emperor Louis, to
add to the importance of his party and to receive the crown, came
into Italy; and being at Milan, as an excuse for taking money of the
Milanese, he pretended to make them free and to put the Visconti in
prison; but shortly afterwards he released them, and, having gone to
Rome, in order to disturb Italy with less difficulty, he made Piero
della Corvara anti-pope, by whose influence, and the power of the
Visconti, he designed to weaken the opposite faction in Tuscany and
Lombardy. But Castruccio died, and his death caused the failure of the
emperor's purpose; for Pisa and Lucca rebelled. The Pisans sent Piero
della Corvara a prisoner to the pope in France, and the emperor,
despairing of the affairs of Italy, returned to Germany. He had scarcely
left, before John king of Bohemia came into the country, at the request
of the Ghibellines of Brescia, and made himself lord of that city and of
Bergamo. And as his entry was with the consent of the pope, although
he feigned the contrary, the legate of Bologna favored him, thinking by
this means to prevent the return of the emperor. This caused a change in
the parties of Italy; for the Florentines and King Robert, finding the
legate was favorable to the enterprises of the Ghibellines, became foes
of all those to whom the legate and the king of Bohemia were friendly.
Without having regard for either faction, whether Guelph or Ghibelline,
many princes joined them, of whom, among others, were the Visconti, the
Della Scala, Filippo Gonzao of Mantua, the Carrara, and those of Este.
Upon this the pope excommunicated them all. The king, in fear of the
league, went to collect forces in his own country, and having returned
with a large army, still found his undertaking a difficult one; so,
seeing his error, he withdrew to Bohemia, to the great displeasure of
the legate, leaving only Reggio and Modena guarded, and Parma in the
care of Marsilio and Piero de' Rossi, who were the most powerful men in
the city. The king of Bohemia being gone, Bologna joined the league; and
the leaguers divided among themselves the four cities which remained of
the church faction. They agreed that Parma should pertain to the Della
Scalla; Reggio to the Gonzaga; Modena to the family of Este, and Lucca
to the Florentines. But in taking possession of these cities, many
disputes arose which were afterward in a great measure settled by the
Venetians. Some, perhaps, will think it a species of impropriety that
we have so long deferred speaking of the Venetians, theirs being a
republic, which, both on account of its power and internal regulations,
deserves to be celebrated above any principality of Italy. But that this
surprise may cease when the cause is known, I shall speak of their city
from a more remote period; that everyone may understand what were their
beginnings, and the causes which so long withheld them from interfering
in the affairs of Italy.

When Attila, king of the Huns, besieged Aquileia, the inhabitants, after
defending themselves a long time, began to despair of effecting their
safety, and fled for refuge to several uninhabited rocks, situated at
the point of the Adriatic Sea, now called the Gulf of Venice, carrying
with them whatever movable property they possessed. The people of Padua,
finding themselves in equal danger, and knowing that, having became
master of Aquileia, Attila would next attack themselves, also removed
with their most valuable property to a place on the same sea, called
Rivo Alto, to which they brought their women, children, and aged
persons, leaving the youth in Padua to assist in her defense. Besides
these, the people of Monselice, with the inhabitants of the surrounding
hills, driven by similar fears, fled to the same rocks. But after Attila
had taken Aquileia, and destroyed Padua, Monselice, Vicenza, and Verona,
the people of Padua and others who were powerful, continued to inhabit
the marshes about Rivo Alto; and, in like manner, all the people of the
province anciently called Venetia, driven by the same events, became
collected in these marshes. Thus, under the pressure of necessity,
they left an agreeable and fertile country to occupy one sterile and
unwholesome. However, in consequence of a great number of people being
drawn together into a comparatively small space, in a short time
they made those places not only habitable, but delightful; and having
established among themselves laws and useful regulations, enjoyed
themselves in security amid the devastations of Italy, and soon
increased both in reputation and strength. For, besides the inhabitants
already mentioned, many fled to these places from the cities of
Lombardy, principally to escape from the cruelties of Clefis king of the
Lombards, which greatly tended to increase the numbers of the new city;
and in the conventions which were made between Pepin, king of France,
and the emperor of Greece, when the former, at the entreaty of the pope,
came to drive the Lombards out of Italy, the duke of Benevento and the
Venetians did not render obedience to either the one or the other,
but alone enjoyed their liberty. As necessity had led them to dwell
on sterile rocks, they were compelled to seek the means of subsistence
elsewhere; and voyaging with their ships to every port of the ocean,
their city became a depository for the various products of the world,
and was itself filled with men of every nation.

For many years the Venetians sought no other dominion than that which
tended to facilitate their commercial enterprises, and thus acquired
many ports in Greece and Syria; and as the French had made frequent use
of their ships in voyages to Asia, the island of Candia was assigned to
them in recompense for these services. While they lived in this manner,
their name spread terror over the seas, and was held in veneration
throughout Italy. This was so completely the case, that they were
generally chosen to arbitrate in controversies between the states, as
occurred in the difference between the Colleagues, on account of the
cities they had divided among themselves; which being referred to the
Venetians, they awarded Brescia and Bergamo to the Visconti. But when,
in the course of time, urged by their eagerness for dominion, they had
made themselves masters of Padua, Vicenza, Trevisa, and afterward
of Verona, Bergamo, and Brescia, with many cities in Romagna and the
kingdom of Naples, other nations were impressed with such an opinion of
their power, that they were a terror, not only to the princes of Italy,
but to the ultramontane kings. These states entered into an alliance
against them, and in one day wrested from them the provinces they had
obtained with so much labor and expense; and although they have in
latter times reacquired some portions, still possessing neither power
nor reputation, like all the other Italian powers, they live at the
mercy of others.

Benedict XII. having attained the pontificate and finding Italy lost,
fearing, too, that the emperor would assume the sovereignty of
the country, determined to make friends of all who had usurped the
government of those cities which had been accustomed to obey the
emperor; that they might have occasion to dread the latter, and unite
with himself in the defense of Italy. To this end he issued a decree,
confirming to all the tyrants of Lombardy the places they had seized.
After making this concession the pope died, and was succeeded by
Clement VI. The emperor, seeing with what a liberal hand the pontiff had
bestowed the dominions of the empire, in order to be equally bountiful
with the property of others, gave to all who had assumed sovereignty
over the cities or territories of the church, the imperial authority
to retain possession of them. By this means Galeotto Malatesti and
his brothers became lords of Rimino, Pesaro, and Fano; Antonio da
Montefeltro, of the Marca and Urbino; Gentile da Varano, of Camerino;
Guido di Polenta, of Ravenna; Sinibaldo Ordelaffi, of Furli and Cesena;
Giovanni Manfredi, of Faenza; Lodovico Alidossi, of Imola; and besides
these, many others in divers places. Thus, of all the cities, towns, or
fortresses of the church, few remained without a prince; for she did not
recover herself till the time of Alexander VI., who, by the ruin of the
descendants of these princes, restored the authority of the church.

The emperor, when he made the concession before named, being at Tarento,
signified an intention of going into Italy. In consequence of this, many
battles were fought in Lombardy, and the Visconti became lords of Parma.
Robert king of Naples, now died, leaving only two grandchildren, the
issue of his sons Charles, who had died a considerable time before him.
He ordered that the elder of the two, whose name was Giovanna or Joan,
should be heiress of the kingdom, and take for her husband Andrea, son
of the king of Hungary, his grandson. Andrea had not lived with her
long, before she caused him to be murdered, and married another cousin,
Louis, prince of Tarento. But Louis, king of Hungary, and brother of
Andrea, in order to avenge his death, brought forces into Italy, and
drove Queen Joan and her husband out of the kingdom.

At this period a memorable circumstance took place at Rome. Niccolo di
Lorenzo, often called Rienzi or Cola di Rienzi, who held the office of
chancellor at Campidoglio, drove the senators from Rome and, under the
title of tribune, made himself the head of the Roman republic; restoring
it to its ancient form, and with so great reputation of justice and
virtue, that not only the places adjacent, but the whole of Italy sent
ambassadors to him. The ancient provinces, seeing Rome arise to new
life, again raised their heads, and some induced by hope, others by
fear, honored him as their sovereign. But Niccolo, notwithstanding
his great reputation, lost all energy in the very beginning of
his enterprise; and as if oppressed with the weight of so vast an
undertaking, without being driven away, secretly fled to Charles, king
of Bohemia, who, by the influence of the pope, and in contempt of Louis
of Bavaria, had been elected emperor. Charles, to ingratiate himself
with the pontiff, sent Niccolo to him, a prisoner. After some time, in
imitation of Rienzi, Francesco Baroncegli seized upon the tribunate of
Rome, and expelled the senators; and the pope, as the most effectual
means of repressing him, drew Niccolo from his prison, sent him to Rome,
and restored to him the office of tribune; so that he reoccupied
the state and put Francesco to death; but the Colonnesi becoming his
enemies, he too, after a short time, shared the same fate, and the
senators were again restored to their office. The king of Hungary,
having driven out Queen Joan, returned to his kingdom; but the pope,
who chose to have the queen in the neighborhood of Rome rather than the
king, effected her restoration to the sovereignty, on the condition that
her husband, contenting himself with the title of prince of Tarento,
should not be called king. Being the year 1350, the pope thought that
the jubilee, appointed by Boniface VIII. to take place at the conclusion
of each century, might be renewed at the end of each fifty years; and
having issued a decree for the establishment of it, the Romans, in
acknowledgment of the benefit, consented that he should send four
cardinals to reform the government of the city, and appoint senators
according to his own pleasure. The pope again declared Louis of Tarento,
king, and in gratitude for the benefit, Queen Joan gave Avignon, her
inheritance, to the church. About this time Luchino Visconti died, and
his brother the archbishop, remaining lord of Milan, carried on many
wars against Tuscany and his neighbors, and became very powerful.
Bernabo and Galeazzo, his nephews, succeeded him; but Galeazzo soon
after died, leaving Giovan Galeazzo, who shared the state with Bernabo.
Charles, king of Bohemia, was then emperor, and the pontificate was
occupied by Innocent VI., who sent Cardinal Egidio, a Spaniard, into
Italy. He restored the reputation of the church, not only in Rome and
Romagna, but throughout the whole of Italy; he recovered Bologna from
the archbishop of Milan, and compelled the Romans to accept a foreign
senator appointed annually by the pope. He made honorable terms with the
Visconti, and routed and took prisoner, John Agut, an Englishman, who
with four thousand English had fought on the side of the Ghibellines in
Tuscany. Urban V., hearing of so many victories, resolved to visit Italy
and Rome, whither also the emperor came; after remaining a few months,
he returned to the kingdom of Bohemia, and the pope to Avignon. On
the death of Urban, Gregory XI. was created pope; and, as the Cardinal
Egidio was dead, Italy again recommenced her ancient discords,
occasioned by the union of the other powers against the Visconti; and
the pope, having first sent a legate with six thousand Bretons, came in
person and established the papal court at Rome in 1376, after an absence
of seventy-one years in France. To Gregory XI., succeeded Urban VI., but
shortly afterwards Clement VI. was elected at Fondi by ten cardinals,
who declared the appointment of Urban irregular. At this time, the
Genoese threw off the yoke of the Visconti under whom they had lived
many years; and between them and the Venetians several important battles
were fought for the island of Tenedos. Although the Genoese were for a
time successful, and held Venice in a state of siege during many months,
the Venetians were at length victorious; and by the intervention of
the pope, peace was made in the year 1381. In these wars, artillery was
first used, having been recently invented by the Dutch.



CHAPTER VII

Schism in the church--Ambitious views of Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti--The
pope and the Romans come to an agreement--Boniface IX. introduces the
practice of Annates--Disturbance in Lombardy--The Venetians acquire
dominion on terra firma--Differences between the pope and the people of
Rome--Council of Pisa--Council of Constance--Filippo Visconti recovers
his dominion--Giovanna II. of Naples--Political condition of Italy.

A schism having thus arisen in the church, Queen Joan favored the
schismatic pope, upon which Urban caused Charles of Durazzo, descended
from the kings of Naples, to undertake the conquest of her dominions.
Having succeeded in his object, she fled to France, and he assumed the
sovereignty. The king of France, being exasperated, sent Louis of Anjou
into Italy to recover the kingdom for the queen, to expel Urban from
Rome, and establish the anti-pope. But in the midst of this enterprise
Louis died, and his people being routed returned to France. In this
conjuncture the pope went to Naples, where he put nine cardinals into
prison for having taken the part of France and the anti-pope. He then
became offended with the king, for having refused to make his nephew
prince of Capua; and pretending not to care about it, requested he
would grant him Nocera for his habitation, but, having fortified it,
he prepared to deprive the king of his dominions. Upon this the king
pitched his camp before the place, and the pope fled to Naples, where
he put to death the cardinals whom he had imprisoned. From thence
he proceeded to Rome, and, to acquire influence, created twenty-nine
cardinals. At this time Charles, king of Naples, went to Hungary,
where, having been made king, he was shortly afterward killed in battle,
leaving a wife and two children at Naples. About the same time Giovanni
Galeazzo Visconti murdered Bernabo his uncle and took the entire
sovereignty upon himself; and, not content with being duke of Milan and
sovereign of the whole of Lombardy, designed to make himself master of
Tuscany; but while he was intent upon occupying the province with the
ultimate view of making himself king of Italy, he died. Boniface IX.
succeeded Urban VI. The anti-pope, Clement VI., also died, and Benedict
XIII. was appointed his successor.

Many English, Germans, and Bretons served at this period in the armies
of Italy, commanded partly by those leaders who had from time to time
authority in the country, and partly by such as the pontiffs sent, when
they were at Avignon. With these warriors the princes of Italy long
carried on their wars, till the coming of Lodovico da Cento of Romagna,
who formed a body of Italian soldiery, called the Company of St. George,
whose valor and discipline soon caused the foreign troops to fall into
disrepute, and gave reputation to the native forces of the country, of
which the princes afterward availed themselves in their wars with each
other. The pope, Boniface IX., being at enmity with the Romans, went to
Scesi, where he remained till the jubilee of 1400, when the Romans, to
induce him to return to the city, consented to receive another foreign
senator of his appointing, and also allowed him to fortify the castle of
Saint Angelo: having returned upon these conditions, in order to enrich
the church, he ordained that everyone, upon vacating a benefice, should
pay a year's value of it to the Apostolic Chamber.

After the death of Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, although he left
two children, Giovanmaria and Filippo, the state was divided into many
parts, and in the troubles which ensued Giovanmaria was slain. Filippo
remained some time in the castle of Pavia, from which, through the
fidelity and virtue of the castellan, he escaped. Among others who
occupied cities possessed by his father, was Guglielmo della Scala, who,
being banished, fell into the hands of Francesco de Carrera, lord of
Padua, by whose means he recovered the state of Verona, in which he only
remained a short time, for he was poisoned, by order of Francesco, and
the city taken from him. These things occasioned the people of Vicenza,
who had lived in security under the protection of the Visconti, to dread
the greatness of the lord of Padua, and they placed themselves under the
Venetians, who, engaging in arms with him, first took Verona and then
Padua.

At this time Pope Boniface died, and was succeeded by Innocent VII. The
people of Rome supplicated him to restore to them their fortresses
and their liberty; but as he would not consent to their petition,
they called to their assistance Ladislaus, king of Naples. Becoming
reconciled to the people, the pope returned to Rome, and made his nephew
Lodovico count of La Marca. Innocent soon after died, and Gregory XII.
was created, upon the understanding to renounce the papacy whenever the
anti-pope would also renounce it. By the advice of the cardinals, in
order to attempt the reunion of the church, Benedict, the anti-pope,
came to Porto Venere, and Gregory to Lucca, where they made many
endeavors, but effected nothing. Upon this, the cardinals of both the
popes abandoned them, Benedict going to Spain, and Gregory to Rimini.
On the other hand, the cardinals, with the favor of Balthazar Cossa,
cardinal and legate of Bologna, appointed a council at Pisa, where they
created Alexander V., who immediately excommunicated King Ladislaus,
and invested Louis of Anjou with the kingdom; this prince, with the
Florentines, Genoese, and Venetians, attacked Ladislaus and drove him
from Rome. In the head of the war Alexander died, and Balthazar Cossa
succeeded him, with the title of John XXIII. Leaving Bologna, where he
was elected, he went to Rome, and found there Louis of Anjou, who
had brought the army from Provence, and coming to an engagement with
Ladislaus, routed him. But by the mismanagement of the leaders, they
were unable to prosecute the victory, so that the king in a short time
gathered strength and retook Rome. Louis fled to Provence, the pope
to Bologna; where, considering how he might diminish the power of
Ladislaus, he caused Sigismund, king of Hungary, to be elected emperor,
and advised him to come to Italy. Having a personal interview at Mantua,
they agreed to call a general council, in which the church should be
united; and having effected this, the pope thought he should be fully
enabled to oppose the forces of his enemies.

At this time there were three popes, Gregory, Benedict, and Giovanni,
which kept the church weak and in disrepute. The city of Constance, in
Germany, was appointed for the holding of the council, contrary to
the expectation of Pope John. And although the death of Ladislaus had
removed the cause which induced the pope to call the council, still,
having promised to attend, he could not refuse to go there. In a few
months after his arrival at Constance he discovered his error, but it
was too late; endeavoring to escape, he was taken, put into prison, and
compelled to renounce the papacy. Gregory, one of the anti-popes, sent
his renunciation; Benedict, the other, refusing to do the same, was
condemned as a heretic; but, being abandoned by his cardinals, he
complied, and the council elected Oddo, of the Colonnesi family, pope,
by the title of Martin V. Thus the church was united under one head,
after having been divided by many pontiffs.

Filippo Visconti was, as we have said, in the fortress of Pavia. But
Fazino Cane, who in the affairs of Lombardy had become lord of Vercelli,
Alessandria, Novara, and Tortona, and had amassed great riches, finding
his end approach, and having no children, left his wife Beatrice heiress
of his estates, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be
effected between her and Filippo. By this union Filippo became powerful,
and reacquired Milan and the whole of Lombardy. By way of being grateful
for these numerous favors, as princes commonly are, he accused Beatrice
of adultery and caused her to be put to death. Finding himself now
possessed of greater power, he began to think of warring with Tuscany
and of prosecuting the designs of Giovanni Galeazzo, his father.

Ladislaus, king of Naples, at his death, left to his sister Giovanna the
kingdom and a large army, under the command of the principal leaders of
Italy, among the first of whom was Sforza of Cotignuola, reputed by the
soldiery of that period to be a very valiant man. The queen, to shun the
disgrace of having kept about her person a certain Pandolfello, whom she
had brought up, took for her husband Giacopo della Marca, a Frenchman of
the royal line, on the condition that he should be content to be called
Prince of Tarento, and leave to her the title and government of the
kingdom. But the soldiery, upon his arrival in Naples, proclaimed him
king; so that between the husband and the wife wars ensued; and although
they contended with varying success, the queen at length obtained the
superiority, and became an enemy of the pope. Upon this, in order
to reduce her to necessity, and that she might be compelled to throw
herself into his lap, Sforza suddenly withdrew from her service without
giving her any pervious notice of his intention to do so. She thus found
herself at once unarmed, and not having any other source, sought the
assistance of Alfonzo, king of Aragon and Sicily, adopted him as her
son, and engaged Braccio of Montone as her captain, who was of equal
reputation in arms with Sforza, and inimical to the pope, on account of
his having taken possession of Perugia and some other places belonging
to the church. After this, peace was made between the queen and the
pontiff; but King Alfonzo, expecting she would treat him as she had her
husband, endeavored secretly to make himself master of the strongholds;
but, possessing acute observation, she was beforehand with him, and
fortified herself in the castle of Naples. Suspicions increasing between
them, they had recourse to arms, and the queen, with the assistance
of Sforza, who again resumed her service, drove Alfonzo out of Naples,
deprived him of his succession, and adopted Louis of Anjou in his stead.
Hence arose new contests between Braccio, who took the part of Alfonzo,
and Sforza, who defended the cause of the queen. In the course of the
war, Sforza was drowned in endeavoring to pass the river Pescara; the
queen was thus again unarmed, and would have been driven out of the
kingdom, but for the assistance of Filippo Visconti, the duke of Milan,
who compelled Alfonzo to return to Aragon. Braccio, undaunted at the
departure of Alfonzo, continued the enterprise against the queen, and
besieged L'Aquilla; but the pope, thinking the greatness of Braccio
injurious to the church, received into his pay Francesco, the son of
Sforza, who went in pursuit of Braccio to L'Aquilla, where he routed
and slew him. Of Braccio remained Oddo, his son, from whom the pope took
Perugia, and left him the state of Montone alone; but he was shortly
afterward slain in Romagna, in the service of the Florentines; so that
of those who had fought under Braccio, Niccolo Piccinino remained of
greatest reputation.

Having continued our general narration nearly to the period which we at
first proposed to reach, what remains is of little importance, except
the war which the Florentines and Venetians carried on against
Filippo duke of Milan, of which an account will be given when we speak
particularly of Florence. I shall, therefore, continue it no further,
briefly explaining the condition of Italy in respect of her princes and
her arms, at the period to which we have now come. Joan II. held Naples,
La Marca, the Patrimony and Romagna; some of these places obeyed the
church, while others were held by vicars or tyrants, as Ferrara, Modena,
and Reggio, by those of the House of Este; Faenza by the Manfredi;
Imola by the Alidossi; Furli by the Ordelaffi; Rimini and Psaro by the
Malatesti; and Camerino by those of Varano. Part of Lombardy was subject
to the Duke Filippo, part to the Venetians; for all those who had held
single states were set aside, except the House of Gonzaga, which ruled
in Mantua. The greater part of Tuscany was subject to the Florentines.
Lucca and Sienna alone were governed by their own laws; Lucca was under
the Guinigi; Sienna was free. The Genoese, being sometimes free,
at others, subject to the kings of France or the Visconti, lived
unrespected, and may be enumerated among the minor powers.

None of the principal states were armed with their own proper forces.
Duke Filippo kept himself shut up in his apartments, and would not
allow himself to be seen; his wars were managed by commissaries. The
Venetians, when they directed their attention to terra firma, threw off
those arms which had made them terrible upon the seas, and falling into
the customs of Italy, submitted their forces to the direction of others.
The practice of arms being unsuitable to priests or women, the pope and
Queen Joan of Naples were compelled by necessity to submit to the same
system which others practiced from defect of judgment. The Florentines
also adopted the same custom, for having, by their frequent divisions,
destroyed the nobility, and their republic being wholly in the hands of
men brought up to trade, they followed the usages and example of others.

Thus the arms of Italy were either in the hands of the lesser princes,
or of men who possessed no state; for the minor princes did not adopt
the practice of arms from any desire of glory, but for the acquisition
of either property or safety. The others (those who possessed no state)
being bred to arms from their infancy, were acquainted with no other
art, and pursued war for emolument, or to confer honor upon themselves.
The most noticed among the latter were Carmignola, Francesco Sforza,
Niccolo Piccinino the pupil of Braccio, Agnolo della Pergola, Lorenzo
di Micheletto Attenduli, il Tartaglia, Giacopaccio, Cecolini da Perugia,
Niccolo da Tolentino, Guido Torello, Antonia dal Ponte ad Era, and many
others. With these, were those lords of whom I have before spoken, to
which may be added the barons of Rome, the Colonnesi and the Orsini,
with other lords and gentlemen of the kingdoms of Naples and Lombardy,
who, being constantly in arms, had such an understanding among
themselves, and so contrived to accommodate things to their own
convenience, that of those who were at war, most commonly both
sides were losers; and they had made the practice of arms so totally
ridiculous, that the most ordinary leader, possessed of true valor,
would have covered these men with disgrace, whom, with so little
prudence, Italy honored.

With these idle princes and such contemptible arms, my history must,
therefore, be filled; to which, before I descend, it will be necessary,
as was at first proposed, to speak of the origin of Florence, that it
may be clearly understood what was the state of the city in those times,
and by what means, through the labours of a thousand years, she became
so imbecile.

CHAPTER I

The custom of ancient republics to plant colonies, and the advantage of
it--Increased population tends to make countries more healthy--Origin
of Florence--Aggrandizement of Florence--Origin of the name of
Florence--Destruction of Florence by Totila--The Florentines

Among the great and wonderful institutions of the republics and
principalities of antiquity that have now gone into disuse, was that by
means of which towns and cities were from time to time established; and
there is nothing more worthy the attention of a great prince, or of
a well-regulated republic, or that confers so many advantages upon a
province, as the settlement of new places, where men are drawn together
for mutual accommodation and defense. This may easily be done, by
sending people to reside in recently acquired or uninhabited countries.
Besides causing the establishment of new cities, these removals render
a conquered country more secure, and keep the inhabitants of a province
properly distributed. Thus, deriving the greatest attainable comfort,
the inhabitants increase rapidly, are more prompt to attack others, and
defend themselves with greater assurance. This custom, by the unwise
practice of princes and republics, having gone into desuetude, the ruin
and weakness of territories has followed; for this ordination is that
by which alone empires are made secure, and countries become populated.
Safety is the result of it; because the colony which a prince
establishes in a newly acquired country, is like a fortress and a
guard, to keep the inhabitants in fidelity and obedience. Neither can
a province be wholly occupied and preserve a proper distribution of its
inhabitants without this regulation; for all districts are not equally
healthy, and hence some will abound to overflowing, while others are
void; and if there be no method of withdrawing them from places in which
they increase too rapidly, and planting them where they are too few the
country would soon be wasted; for one part would become a desert, and
the other a dense and wretched population. And, as nature cannot repair
this disorder, it is necessary that industry should effect it, for
unhealthy localities become wholesome when a numerous population is
brought into them. With cultivation the earth becomes fruitful, and the
air is purified with fires--remedies which nature cannot provide. The
city of Venice proves the correctness of these remarks. Being placed in
a marshy and unwholesome situation, it became healthy only by the
number of industrious individuals who were drawn together. Pisa, too, on
account of its unwholesome air, was never filled with inhabitants,
till the Saracens, having destroyed Genoa and rendered her rivers
unnavigable, caused the Genoese to migrate thither in vast numbers, and
thus render her populous and powerful. Where the use of colonies is not
adopted, conquered countries are held with great difficulty; districts
once uninhabited still remain so, and those which populate quickly
are not relieved. Hence it is that many places of the world, and
particularly in Italy, in comparison of ancient times, have become
deserts. This has wholly arisen and proceeded from the negligence of
princes, who have lost all appetite for true glory, and of republics
which no longer possess institutions that deserve praise. In ancient
times, by means of colonies, new cities frequently arose, and those
already begun were enlarged, as was the case with Florence, which had
its beginning from Fiesole, and its increase from colonies.

It is exceedingly probable, as Dante and Giovanni Villani show, that the
city of Fiesole, being situate upon the summit of the mountain, in
order that her markets might be more frequented, and afford greater
accommodation for those who brought merchandise, would appoint the place
in which to told them, not upon the hill, but in the plain, between the
foot of the mountain and the river Arno. I imagine these markets to have
occasioned the first erections that were made in those places, and
to have induced merchants to wish for commodious warehouses for the
reception of their goods, and which, in time, became substantial
buildings. And afterward, when the Romans, having conquered the
Carthaginians, rendered Italy secure from foreign invasion, these
buildings would greatly increase; for men never endure inconveniences
unless some powerful necessity compels them. Thus, although the fear
of war induces a willingness to occupy places strong and difficult of
access, as soon as the cause of alarm is removed, men gladly resort to
more convenient and easily attainable localities. Hence, the security
to which the reputation of the Roman republic gave birth, caused the
inhabitants, having begun in the manner described, to increase so much
as to form a town, this was at first called the Villa Arnina. After this
occurred the civil wars between Marius and Sylla; then those of Cæsar,
and Pompey; and next those of the murderers of Cæsar, and the parties
who undertook to avenge his death. Therefore, first by Sylla, and
afterward by the three Roman citizens, who, having avenged the death
of Cæsar, divided the empire among themselves, colonies were sent to
Fiesole, which, either in part or in whole, fixed their habitations in
the plain, near to the then rising town. By this increase, the place
became so filled with dwellings, that it might with propriety be
enumerated among the cities of Italy.

There are various opinions concerning the derivation of the word
Florentia. Some suppose it to come from Florinus, one of the principal
persons of the colony; others think it was originally not Florentia, but
Fluentia, and suppose the word derived from _fluente_, or flowing of the
Arno; and in support of their opinion, adduce a passage from Pliny, who
says, "the Fluentini are near the flowing of the Arno." This, however,
may be incorrect, for Pliny speaks of the locality of the Florentini,
not of the name by which they were known. And it seems as if the word
Fluentini were a corruption, because Frontinus and Cornelius Tacitus,
who wrote at nearly the same period as Pliny, call them Florentia and
Florentini; for, in the time of Tiberius, they were governed like
the other cities of Italy. Besides, Cornelius refers to the coming of
ambassadors from the Florentines, to beg of the emperor that the waters
of the Chiane might not be allowed to overflow their country; and it is
not at all reasonable that the city should have two names at the same
time. Therefore I think that, however derived, the name was always
Florentia, and that whatever the origin might be, it occurred under the
Roman empire, and began to be noticed by writers in the times of the
first emperors.

When the Roman empire was afflicted by the barbarians, Florence was
destroyed by Totila, king of the Ostrogoths; and after a period of two
hundred and fifty years, rebuilt by Charlemagne; from whose time, till
the year 1215, she participated in the fortune of the rest of Italy;
and, during this period, first the descendants of Charles, then the
Berengarii, and lastly the German emperors, governed her, as in our
general treatise we have shown. Nor could the Florentines, during those
ages, increase in numbers, or effect anything worthy of memory,
on account of the influence of those to whom they were subject.
Nevertheless, in the year 1010, upon the feast of St. Romolo, a solemn
day with the Fiesolani, they took and destroyed Fiesole, which must have
been performed either with the consent of the emperors, or during the
interim from the death of one to the creation of his successor, when
all assumed a larger share of liberty. But then the pontiffs acquired
greater influence, and the authority of the German emperors was in its
wane, all the places of Italy governed themselves with less respect for
the prince; so that, in the time of Henry III. the mind of the country
was divided between the emperor and the church. However, the Florentines
kept themselves united until the year 1215, rendering obedience to the
ruling power, and anxious only to preserve their own safety. But, as
the diseases which attack our bodies are more dangerous and mortal in
proportion as they are delayed, so Florence, though late to take part in
the sects of Italy, was afterward the more afflicted by them. The cause
of her first division is well known, having been recorded by Dante and
many other writers; I shall, however, briefly notice it.

Among the most powerful families of Florence were the Buondelmonti and
the Uberti; next to these were the Amidei and the Donati. Of the Donati
family there was a rich widow who had a daughter of exquisite beauty,
for whom, in her own mind, she had fixed upon Buondelmonti, a young
gentleman, the head of the Buondelmonti family, as her husband; but
either from negligence, or, because she thought it might be accomplished
at any time, she had not made known her intention, when it happened that
the cavalier betrothed himself to a maiden of the Amidei family. This
grieved the Donati widow exceedingly; but she hoped, with her daughter's
beauty, to disturb the arrangement before the celebration of the
marriage; and from an upper apartment, seeing Buondelmonti approach her
house alone, she descended, and as he was passing she said to him, "I
am glad to learn you have chosen a wife, although I had reserved my
daughter for you;" and, pushing the door open, presented her to his
view. The cavalier, seeing the beauty of the girl, which was very
uncommon, and considering the nobility of her blood, and her portion not
being inferior to that of the lady whom he had chosen, became inflamed
with such an ardent desire to possess her, that, not thinking of the
promise given, or the injury he committed in breaking it, or of the
evils which his breach of faith might bring upon himself, said, "Since
you have reserved her for me, I should be very ungrateful indeed to
refuse her, being yet at liberty to choose;" and without any delay
married her. As soon as the fact became known, the Amidei and the
Uberti, whose families were allied, were filled with rage, and having
assembled with many others, connections of the parties, they concluded
that the injury could not be tolerated without disgrace, and that the
only vengeance proportionate to the enormity of the offence would be to
put Buondelmonti to death. And although some took into consideration the
evils that might ensue upon it, Mosca Lamberti said, that those who talk
of many things effect nothing, using that trite and common adage, _Cosa
fatta capo ha_. Thereupon, they appointed to the execution of the murder
Mosca himself, Stiatti Uberti, Lambertuccio Amidei, and Oderigo Fifanti,
who, on the morning of Easter day, concealed themselves in a house of
the Amidei, situate between the old bridge and St. Stephen's, and as
Buondelmonti was passing upon a white horse, thinking it as easy a
matter to forget an injury as reject an alliance, he was attacked by
them at the foot of the bridge, and slain close by a statue of Mars.
This murder divided the whole city; one party espousing the cause of
the Buondelmonti, the other that of the Uberti; and as these families
possessed men and means of defense, they contended with each other for
many years, without one being able to destroy the other.

Florence continued in these troubles till the time of Frederick II.,
who, being king of Naples, endeavored to strengthen himself against the
church; and, to give greater stability to his power in Tuscany, favored
the Uberti and their followers, who, with his assistance, expelled the
Buondelmonti; thus our city, as all the rest of Italy had long time
been, became divided into Guelphs and Ghibellines; and as it will not
be superfluous, I shall record the names of the families which took part
with each faction. Those who adopted the cause of the Guelphs were
the Buondelmonti, Nerli, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Mozzi, Bardi, Pulci,
Gherardini, Foraboschi, Bagnesi, Guidalotti, Sacchetti, Manieri,
Lucardesi, Chiaramontesi, Compiobbesi, Cavalcanti, Giandonati,
Gianfigliazzi, Scali, Gualterotti, Importuni, Bostichi, Tornaquinci,
Vecchietti, Tosinghi, Arrigucci, Agli, Sizi, Adimari, Visdomini, Donati,
Passi, della Bella, Ardinghi, Tedaldi, Cerchi. Of the Ghibelline
faction were the Uberti, Manelli, Ubriachi, Fifanti, Amidei, Infangati,
Malespini, Scolari, Guidi, Galli, Cappiardi, Lamberti, Soldanieri,
Cipriani, Toschi, Amieri, Palermini, Migliorelli, Pigli, Barucci,
Cattani, Agolanti, Brunelleschi, Caponsacchi, Elisei, Abati, Tidaldini,
Giuochi, and Galigai. Besides the noble families on each side above
enumerated, each party was joined by many of the higher ranks of the
people, so that the whole city was corrupted with this division. The
Guelphs being expelled, took refuge in the Upper Val d'Arno, where
part of their castles and strongholds were situated, and where they
strengthened and fortified themselves against the attacks of their
enemies. But, upon the death of Frederick, the most unbiased men, and
those who had the greatest authority with the people, considered that it
would be better to effect the reunion of the city, than, by keeping her
divided, cause her ruin. They therefore induced the Guelphs to forget
their injuries and return, and the Ghibellines to lay aside their
jealousies and receive them with cordiality.

Florentines reform the government in favor of the Guelphs--The pope
endeavors to restore the Ghibellines and excommunicates Florence--Pope
Nicholas III. endeavors to abate the power of Charles king of Naples.

Being united, the Florentines thought the time favorable for the
ordination of a free government, and that it would be desirable to
provide their means of defense before the new emperor should acquire
strength. They therefore divided the city into six parts, and elected
twelve citizens, two for each sixth, to govern the whole. These were
called Anziani, and were elected annually. To remove the cause of those
enmities which had been observed to arise from judicial decisions, they
provided two judges from some other state,--one called captain of the
people, the other podesta, or provost,--whose duty it was to decide in
cases, whether civil or criminal, which occurred among the people. And
as order cannot be preserved without a sufficient force for the defense
of it, they appointed twenty banners in the city, and seventy-six in the
country, upon the rolls of which the names of all the youth were armed;
and it was ordered that everyone should appear armed, under his banner,
whenever summoned, whether by the captain of the people or the Anziani.
They had ensigns according to the kind of arms they used, the bowmen
being under one ensign, and the swordsmen, or those who carried a
target, under another; and every year, upon the day of Pentecost,
ensigns were given with great pomp to the new men, and new leaders
were appointed for the whole establishment. To give importance to their
armies, and to serve as a point of refuge for those who were exhausted
in the fight, and from which, having become refreshed, they might again
make head against the enemy, they provided a large car, drawn by two
oxen, covered with red cloth, upon which was an ensign of white and red.
When they intended to assemble the army, this car was brought into the
New Market, and delivered with pomp to the heads of the people. To give
solemnity to their enterprises, they had a bell called Martinella, which
was rung during a whole month before the forces left the city, in order
that the enemy might have time to provide for his defense; so great was
the virtue then existing among men, and with so much generosity of mind
were they governed, that as it is now considered a brave and prudent act
to assail an unprovided enemy, in those days it would have been thought
disgraceful, and productive only of a fallacious advantage. This bell
was also taken with the army, and served to regulate the keeping and
relief of guard, and other matters necessary in the practice of war.

With these ordinations, civil and military, the Florentines established
their liberty. Nor is it possible to imagine the power and authority
Florence in a short time acquired. She became not only the head of
Tuscany, but was enumerated among the first cities of Italy, and would
have attained greatness of the most exalted kind, had she not been
afflicted with the continual divisions of her citizens. They remained
under the this government ten years, during which time they compelled
the people of Pistoria, Arezzo, and Sienna, to enter into league with
them; and returning with the army from Sienna, they took Volterra,
destroyed some castles, and led the inhabitants to Florence. All these
enterprises were effected by the advice of the Guelphs, who were much
more powerful than the Ghibellines, for the latter were hated by the
people as well on account of their haughty bearing while in power,
during the time of Frederick, as because the church party was in more
favor than that of the emperor; for with the aid of the church they
hoped to preserve their liberty, but, with the emperor, they were
apprehensive of losing it.

The Ghibellines, in the meantime, finding themselves divested of
authority, could not rest, but watched for an occasion of repossessing
the government; and they thought the favorable moment come, when they
found that Manfred, son of Frederick, had made himself sovereign of
Naples, and reduced the power of the church. They, therefore, secretly
communicated with him, to resume the management of the state, but
could not prevent their proceedings from coming to the knowledge of the
Anziani, who immediately summoned the Uberti to appear before them; but
instead of obeying, they took arms and fortified themselves in their
houses. The people, enraged at this, armed themselves, and with the
assistance of the Guelphs, compelled them to quit the city, and,
with the whole Ghibelline party, withdraw to Sienna. They then asked
assistance of Manfred king of Naples, and by the able conduct of
Farinata degli Uberti, the Guelphs were routed by the king's forces
upon the river Arbia, with so great slaughter, that those who escaped,
thinking Florence lost, did not return thither, but sought refuge at
Lucca.

Manfred sent the Count Giordano, a man of considerable reputation
in arms, to command his forces. He after the victory, went with the
Ghibellines to Florence, and reduced the city entirely to the king's
authority, annulling the magistracies and every other institution that
retained any appearance of freedom. This injury, committed with little
prudence, excited the ardent animosity of the people, and their enmity
against the Ghibellines, whose ruin it eventually caused, was increased
to the highest pitch. The necessities of the kingdom compelling the
Count Giordano to return to Naples, he left at Florence as regal vicar
the Count Guido Novallo, lord of Casentino, who called a council of
Ghibellines at Empoli. There it was concluded, with only one dissenting
voice, that in order to preserve their power in Tuscany, it would be
necessary to destroy Florence, as the only means of compelling the
Guelphs to withdraw their support from the party of the church. To this
so cruel a sentence, given against such a noble city, there was not a
citizen who offered any opposition, except Farinata degli Uberti, who
openly defended her, saying he had not encountered so many dangers and
difficulties, but in the hope of returning to his country; that he still
wished for what he had so earnestly sought, nor would he refuse the
blessing which fortune now presented, even though by using it, he were
to become as much an enemy of those who thought otherwise, as he had
been of the Guelphs; and that no one need be afraid the city would
occasion the ruin of their country, for he hoped that the valor which
had expelled the Guelphs, would be sufficient to defend her. Farinata
was a man of undaunted resolution, and excelled greatly in military
affairs: being the head of the Ghibelline party, and in high estimation
with Manfred, his authority put a stop to the discussion, and induced
the rest to think of some other means of preserving their power.

The Lucchese being threatened with the anger of the count, for affording
refuge to the Guelphs after the battle of the Arbia, could allow them
to remain no longer; so leaving Lucca, they went to Bologna, from whence
they were called by the Guelphs of Parma against the Ghibellines of that
city, where, having overcome the enemy, the possessions of the latter
were assigned to them; so that having increased in honors and riches,
and learning that Pope Clement had invited Charles of Anjou to take the
kingdom from Manfred, they sent ambassadors to the pope to offer him
their services. His holiness not only received them as friends, but gave
them a standard upon which his insignia were wrought. It was ever after
borne by the Guelphs in battle, and is still used at Florence. Charles
having taken the kingdom from Manfred, and slain him, to which success
the Guelphs of Florence had contributed, their party became more
powerful, and that of the Ghibellines proportionately weaker. In
consequence of this, those who with Count Novello governed the city,
thought it would be advisable to attach to themselves, with some
concession, the people whom they had previously aggravated with every
species of injury; but these remedies which, if applied before the
necessity came would have been beneficial, being offered when they were
no longer considered favors, not only failed of producing any beneficial
results to the donors, but hastened their ruin. Thinking, however, to
win them to their interests, they restored some of the honors of which
they had deprived them. They elected thirty-six citizens from the higher
rank of the people, to whom, with two cavaliers, knights or gentlemen,
brought from Bologna, the reformation of the government of the city
was confided. As soon as they met, they classed the whole of the
people according to their arts or trades, and over each art appointed a
magistrate, whose duty was to distribute justice to those placed under
him. They gave to each company or trade a banner, under which every man
was expected to appear armed, whenever the city required it. These arts
were at first twelve, seven major and five minor. The minor arts were
afterward increased to fourteen, so that the whole made, as at present,
twenty-one. The thirty-six reformers also effected other changes for the
common good.

Count Guido proposed to lay a tax upon the citizens for the support of
the soldiery; but during the discussion found so much difficulty, that
he did not dare to use force to obtain it; and thinking he had now lost
the government, called together the leaders of the Ghibellines, and they
determined to wrest from the people those powers which they had with so
little prudence conceded. When they thought they had sufficient force,
the thirty-six being assembled, they caused a tumult to be raised, which
so alarmed them that they retired to their houses, when suddenly the
banners of the Arts were unfurled, and many armed men drawn to them.
These, learning that Count Guido and his followers were at St. John's,
moved toward the Holy Trinity, and chose Giovanni Soldanieri for their
leader. The count, on the other hand, being informed where the people
were assembled, proceeded in that direction; nor did the people shun the
fight, for, meeting their enemies where now stands the residence of the
Tornaquinci, they put the count to flight, with the loss of many of his
followers. Terrified with this result, he was afraid his enemies would
attack him in the night, and that his own party, finding themselves
beaten, would murder him. This impression took such hold of his mind
that, without attempting any other remedy, he sought his safety rather
in flight than in combat, and, contrary to the advice of the rectors,
went with all his people to Prato. But, on finding himself in a place
of safety, his fears fled; perceiving his error he wished to correct it,
and on the following day, as soon as light appeared, he returned
with his people to Florence, to enter the city by force which he had
abandoned in cowardice. But his design did not succeed; for the people,
who had had difficulty in expelling him, kept him out with facility; so
that with grief and shame he went to the Casentino, and the Ghibellines
withdrew to their villas.

The people being victorious, by the advice of those who loved the good
of the republic, determined to reunite the city, and recall all the
citizens as well Guelph as Ghibelline, who yet remained without. The
Guelphs returned, after having been expelled six years; the recent
offences of the Ghibellines were forgiven, and themselves restored to
their country. They were, however, most cordially hated, both by the
people and the Guelphs, for the latter could not forget their exile,
and the former but too well remembered their tyranny when they were in
power; the result was, that the minds of neither party became settled.

While affairs were in this state at Florence, a report prevailed that
Corradino, nephew of Manfred, was coming with a force from Germany, for
the conquest of Naples; this gave the Ghibellines hope of recovering
power, and the Guelphs, considering how they should provide for their
security, requested assistance from Charles for their defense, in
case of the passage of Corradino. The coming of the forces of Charles
rendered the Guelphs insolent, and so alarmed the Ghibellines that they
fled the city, without being driven out, two days before the arrival of
the troops.

The Ghibellines having departed, the Florentines reorganized the
government of the city, and elected twelve men who, as the supreme
power, were to hold their magistracy two months, and were not called
Anziani or "ancients," but Buono Uomini or "good men." They also formed
a council of eighty citizens, which they called the Credenza. Besides
these, from each sixth, thirty citizens were chosen, who, with the
Credenza and the twelve Buono Uomini, were called the General Council.
They also appointed another council of one hundred and twenty citizens,
elected from the people and the nobility, to which all those things
were finally referred that had undergone the consideration of the other
councils, and which distributed the offices of the republic. Having
formed this government, they strengthened the Guelphic party by
appointing its friends to the principal offices of state, and a variety
of other measures, that they might be enabled to defend themselves
against the Ghibellines, whose property they divided into three parts,
one of which was applied to the public use, another to the Capitani, and
the third was assigned to the Guelphs, in satisfaction of the injuries
they had received. The pope, too, in order to keep Tuscany in the
Guelphic interest, made Charles imperial vicar over the province.
While the Florentines, by virtue of the new government, preserved their
influence at home by laws, and abroad with arms, the pope died, and
after a dispute, which continued two years, Gregory X. was elected,
being then in Syria, where he had long lived; but not having witnessed
the working of parties, he did not estimate them in the manner his
predecessors had done, and passing through Florence on his way to
France, he thought it would be the office of a good pastor to unite the
city, and so far succeeded that the Florentines consented to receive the
Syndics of the Ghibellines in Florence to consider the terms of their
recall. They effected an agreement, but the Ghibellines without were so
terrified that they did not venture to return. The pope laid the whole
blame upon the city, and being enraged excommunicated her, in which
state of contumacy she remained as long as the pontiff lived; but was
reblessed by his successor Innocent V.

The pontificate was afterward occupied by Nicholas III. of the Orsini
family. It has to be remarked that it was invariably the custom of the
popes to be jealous of those whose power in Italy had become great, even
when its growth had been occasioned by the favors of the church; and as
they always endeavored to destroy it, frequent troubles and changes were
the result. Their fear of a powerful person caused them to increase the
influence of one previously weak; his becoming great caused him also to
be feared, and his being feared made them seek the means of destroying
him. This mode of thinking and operation occasioned the kingdom of
Naples to be taken from Manfred and given to Charles, but as soon as
the latter became powerful his ruin was resolved upon. Actuated by
these motives, Nicholas III. contrived that, with the influence of the
emperor, the government of Tuscany should be taken from Charles, and
Latino his legate was therefore sent into the province in the name of
the empire.



CHAPTER III

Changes in Florence--The Ghibellines recalled--New form of government in
Florence--The Signory created--Victory over the Aretins--The Gonfalonier
of Justice created--Ubaldo Ruffoli the first Gonfalonier--Giano della
Bella--New reform by his advice--Giano della Bella becomes a voluntary
exile--Dissensions between the people and the nobility--The tumults
composed--Reform of Government--Public buildings--The prosperous state
of the city.

Florence was at this time in a very unhappy condition; for the great
Guelphic families had become insolent, and set aside the authority
of the magistrates; so that murders and other atrocities were daily
committed, and the perpetrators escaped unpunished, under the protection
of one or other of the nobility. The leaders of the people, in order
to restrain this insolence, determined to recall those who had been
expelled, and thus gave the legate an opportunity of uniting the city.
The Ghibellines returned, and, instead of twelve governors, fourteen
were appointed, seven for each party, who held their office one year,
and were to be chosen by the pope. The Florentines lived under this
government two years, till the pontificate of Martin, who restored to
Charles all the authority which had been taken from him by Nicholas, so
that parties were again active in Tuscany; for the Florentines took arms
against the emperor's governor, and to deprive the Ghibellines of power,
and restrain the nobility, established a new form of government. This
was in the year 1282, and the companies of the Arts, since magistrates
had been appointed and colors given to them, had acquired so great
influence, that of their own authority they ordered that, instead of
fourteen citizens, three should be appointed and called Priors, to hold
the government of the republic two months, and chosen from either the
people or the nobility. After the expiration of the first magistracy
they were augmented to six, that one might be chosen from each sixth
of the city, and this number was preserved till the year 1342, when the
city was divided into quarters, and the Priors became eight, although
upon some occasions during the interim they were twelve.

This government, as will be seen hereafter, occasioned the ruin of
the nobility; for the people by various causes excluded them from all
participation in it, and then trampled upon them without respect. The
nobles at first, owing to their divisions among themselves, made no
opposition; and each being anxious to rob the other of influence in the
state, they lost it altogether. To this government a palace was given,
in which they were to reside constantly, and all requisite officers
were appointed; it having been previously the custom of councils and
magistrates to assemble in churches. At first they were only called
Priors, but to increase their distinction the word signori, or lords,
was soon afterward adopted. The Florentines remained for some time in
domestic quiet, during which they made war with the Aretins for having
expelled the Guelphs, and obtained a complete victory over them at
Campaldino. The city being increased in riches and population, it was
found expedient to extend the walls, the circle of which was enlarged to
the extent it at present remains, although its diameter was previously
only the space between the old bridge and the church of St. Lorenzo.

Wars abroad and peace within the city had caused the Guelph and
Ghibelline factions to become almost extinct; and the only party feeling
which seemed occasionally to glow, was that which naturally exists in
all cities between the higher classes and the people; for the latter,
wishing to live in conformity with the laws, and the former to be
themselves the rulers of the people, it was not possible for them to
abide in perfect amity together. This ungenial disposition, while their
fear of the Ghibellines kept them in order, did not discover itself, but
no sooner were they subdued than it broke forth, and not a day passed
without some of the populace being injured, while the laws were
insufficient to procure redress, for every noble with his relations
and friends defended himself against the forces of the Priors and
the Capitano. To remedy this evil, the leaders of the Arts' companies
ordered that every Signory at the time of entering upon the duties of
office should appoint a Gonfalonier of Justice, chosen from the people,
and place a thousand armed men at his disposal divided into twenty
companies of fifty men each, and that he, with his gonfalon or banner
and his forces, should be ready to enforce the execution of the laws
whenever called upon, either by the Signors themselves or the Capitano.
The first elected to this high office was Ubaldo Ruffoli. This man
unfurled his gonfalon, and destroyed the houses of the Galletti, on
account of a member of that family having slain one of the Florentine
people in France. The violent animosities among the nobility enabled
the companies of the Arts to establish this law with facility; and the
former no sooner saw the provision which had been made against them than
they felt the acrimonious spirit with which it was enforced. At first
it impressed them with greater terror, but they soon after returned to
their accustomed insolence, for one or more of their body always
making part of the Signory, gave them opportunities of impeding the
Gonfalonier, so that he could not perform the duties of his office.
Besides this, the accuser always required a witness of the injury he had
received, and no one dared to give evidence against the nobility. Thus
in a short time Florence again fell into the same disorders as before,
and the tyranny exercised against the people was as great as ever; for
the decisions of justice were either prevented or delayed, and sentences
were not carried into execution.

In this unhappy state, the people not knowing what to do, Giano della
Bella, of a very noble family, and a lover of liberty, encouraged the
heads of the Arts to reform the constitution of the city; and by his
advice it was ordered that the Gonfalonier should reside with the
Priors, and have four thousand men at his command. They deprived
the nobility of the right to sit in the Signory. They condemned the
associates of a criminal to the same penalty as himself, and ordered
that public report should be taken as evidence. By these laws, which
were called the ordinations of justice, the people acquired great
influence, and Giano della Bella not a small share of trouble; for he
was thoroughly hated by the great, as the destroyer of their power,
while the opulent among the people envied him, for they thought he
possessed too great authority. This became very evident upon the first
occasion that presented itself.

It happened that a man from the class of the people was killed in a
riot, in which several of the nobility had taken a part, and among the
rest Corso Donati, to whom, as the most forward of the party, the death
was attributed. He was, therefore, taken by the captain of the people,
and whether he was really innocent of the crime or the Capitano was
afraid of condemning him, he was acquitted. This acquittal displeased
the people so much, that, seizing their arms, they ran to the house of
Giano della Bella, to beg that he would compel the execution of those
laws which he had himself made. Giano, who wished Corso to be punished,
did not insist upon their laying down their arms, as many were of
opinion he ought to have done, but advised them to go to the
Signory, complain of the fact, and beg that they would take it into
consideration. The people, full of wrath, thinking themselves insulted
by the Capitano and abandoned by Giano della Bella, instead of going
to the Signory went to the palace of the Capitano, of which they made
themselves masters, and plundered it.

This outrage displeased the whole city, and those who wished the ruin of
Giano laid the entire blame upon him; and as in the succeeding Signory
there was an enemy of his, he was accused to the Capitano as the
originator of the riot. While the case was being tried, the people took
arms, and, proceeding to his house, offered to defend him against the
Signory and his enemies. Giano, however, did not wish to put this burst
of popular favor to the proof, or trust his life to the magistrates, for
he feared the malignity of the latter and the instability of the former;
so, in order to remove an occasion for his enemies to injure him, or
his friends to offend the laws, he determined to withdraw, deliver his
countrymen from the fear they had of him, and, leaving the city which
at his own charge and peril he had delivered from the servitude of the
great, become a voluntary exile.

After the departure of Giano della Bella the nobility began to entertain
hopes of recovering their authority; and judging their misfortune to
have arisen from their divisions, they sent two of their body to the
Signory, which they thought was favorable to them, to beg they would be
pleased to moderate the severity of the laws made against them. As soon
as their demand became known, the minds of the people were much excited;
for they were afraid the Signors would submit to them; and so, between
the desire of the nobility and the jealousy of the people, arms were
resorted to. The nobility were drawn together in three places: near the
church of St. John, in the New Market, and in the Piazza of the Mozzi,
under three leaders, Forese Adimari, Vanni de Mozzi, and Geri Spini.
The people assembled in immense numbers, under their ensigns, before the
palace of the Signory, which at that time was situated near St. Procolo;
and, as they suspected the integrity of the Signory, they added six
citizens to their number to take part in the management of affairs.

While both parties were preparing for the fight, some individuals, as
well of the people as of the nobility, accompanied by a few priests of
respectable character, mingled among them for the purpose of effecting
a pacification, reminding the nobility that their loss of power, and the
laws which were made against them, had been occasioned by their haughty
conduct, and the mischievous tendency of their proceedings; that
resorting to arms to recover by force what they had lost by illiberal
measures and disunion, would tend to the destruction of their country
and increase the difficulties of their own position; that they should
bear in mind that the people, both in riches, numbers, and hatred, were
far stronger than they; and that their nobility, on account of which
they assumed to be above others, did not contribute to win battles, and
would be found, when they came to arms, to be but an empty name, and
insufficient to defend them against so many. On the other hand, they
reminded the people that it is not prudent to wish always to have the
last blow; that it is an injudicious step to drive men to desperation,
for he who is without hope is also without fear; that they ought not
to forget that in the wars the nobility had always done honor to the
country, and therefore it was neither wise nor just to pursue them
with so much bitterness; and that although the nobility could bear with
patience the loss of the supreme magistracy, they could not endure that,
by the existing laws, it should be in the power of everyone to drive
them from their country; and, therefore, it would be well to qualify
these laws, and, in furtherance of so good a result, be better to lay
down their arms than, trusting to numbers, try the fortune of a battle;
for it is often seen that the many are overcome by the few. Variety of
opinion was found among the people; many wished to decide the question
by arms at once, for they were assured it would have to be done some
time, and that it would be better to do so then than delay till
the enemy had acquired greater strength; and that if they thought a
mitigation of the laws would satisfy them, that then they would be glad
to comply, but that the pride of the nobility was so great they would
not submit unless they were compelled. To many others, who were more
peaceable and better disposed, it appeared a less evil to qualify the
laws a little than to come to battle; and their opinion prevailing, it
was provided that no accusation against the nobility could be received
unless supported with sufficient testimony.

Although arms were laid aside, both parties remained full of suspicion,
and each fortified itself with men and places of strength. The people
reorganized the government, and lessened the number of its officers, to
which measure they were induced by finding that the Signors appointed
from the families, of which the following were the heads, had been
favorable to the nobility, viz.: the Mancini, Magalotti, Altoviti,
Peruzzi, and Cerretani. Having settled the government, for the greater
magnificence and security of the Signory, they laid the foundation of
their palace; and to make space for the piazza, removed the houses that
had belonged to the Uberti; they also at the same period commenced the
public prisons. These buildings were completed in a few years; nor did
our city ever enjoy a greater state of prosperity than in those times:
filled with men of great wealth and reputation; possessing within her
walls 30,000 men capable of bearing arms, and in the country 70,000,
while the whole of Tuscany, either as subjects or friends, owed
obedience to Florence. And although there might be some indignation and
jealousy between the nobility and the people, they did not produce any
evil effect, but all lived together in unity and peace. And if this
peace had not been disturbed by internal enmities there would have been
no cause of apprehension whatever, for the city had nothing to fear
either from the empire or from those citizens whom political reasons
kept from their homes, and was in condition to meet all the states of
Italy with her own forces. The evil, however, which external powers
could not effect, was brought about by those within.

The Cerchi and the Donati were, for riches, nobility, and the number
and influence of their followers, perhaps the two most distinguished
families in Florence. Being neighbors, both in the city and the country,
there had arisen between them some slight displeasure, which, however,
had not occasioned an open quarrel, and perhaps never would have
produced any serious effect if the malignant humors had not been
increased by new causes. Among the first families of Pistoia was the
Cancellieri. It happened that Lore, son of Gulielmo, and Geri, son of
Bertacca, both of this family, playing together, and coming to words,
Geri was slightly wounded by Lore. This displeased Gulielmo; and,
designing by a suitable apology to remove all cause of further
animosity, he ordered his son to go to the house of the father of the
youth whom he had wounded and ask pardon. Lore obeyed his father; but
this act of virtue failed to soften the cruel mind of Bertacca, and
having caused Lore to be seized, in order to add the greatest indignity
to his brutal act, he ordered his servants to chop off the youth's hand
upon a block used for cutting meat upon, and then said to him, "Go to
thy father, and tell him that sword wounds are cured with iron and not
with words."

The unfeeling barbarity of this act so greatly exasperated Gulielmo that
he ordered his people to take arms for his revenge. Bertacca prepared
for his defense, and not only that family, but the whole city of
Pistoia, became divided. And as the Cancellieri were descended from
a Cancelliere who had had two wives, of whom one was called Bianca
(white), one party was named by those who were descended from her
BIANCA; and the other, by way of greater distinction, was called NERA
(black). Much and long-continued strife took place between the two,
attended with the death of many men and the destruction of much
property; and not being able to effect a union among themselves, but
weary of the evil, and anxious either to bring it to an end, or, by
engaging others in their quarrel, increase it, they came to Florence,
where the Neri, on account of their familiarity with the Donati, were
favored by Corso, the head of that family; and on this account the
Bianchi, that they might have a powerful head to defend them against the
Donati, had recourse to Veri de Cerchi, a man in no respect inferior to
Corso.

This quarrel, and the parties in it, brought from Pistoia, increased the
old animosity between the Cerchi and the Donati, and it was already
so manifest, that the Priors and all well-disposed men were in hourly
apprehension of its breaking out, and causing a division of the whole
city. They therefore applied to the pontiff, praying that he would
interpose his authority between these turbulent parties, and provide the
remedy which they found themselves unable to furnish. The pope sent
for Veri, and charged him to make peace with the Donati, at which Veri
exhibited great astonishment, saying that he had no enmity against them,
and that as pacification presupposes war, he did not know, there being
no war between them, how peacemaking could be necessary. Veri having
returned from Rome without anything being effected, the rage of the
parties increased to such a degree, that any trivial accident seemed
sufficient to make it burst forth, as indeed presently happened.

It was in the month of May, during which, and upon holidays, it is the
custom of Florence to hold festivals and public rejoicings throughout
the city. Some youths of the Donati family, with their friends, upon
horseback, were standing near the church of the Holy Trinity to look
at a party of ladies who were dancing; thither also came some of the
Cerchi, like the Donati, accompanied with many of the nobility, and,
not knowing that the Donati were before them, pushed their horses and
jostled them; thereupon the Donati, thinking themselves insulted, drew
their swords, nor were the Cerchi at all backward to do the same, and
not till after the interchange of many wounds, they separated. This
disturbance was the beginning of great evils; for the whole city became
divided, the people as well as the nobility, and the parties took the
names of the Bianchi and the Neri. The Cerchi were at the head of the
Bianchi faction, to which adhered the Adimari, the Abati, a part of the
Tosinghi, of the Bardi, of the Rossi, of the Frescobaldi, of the Nerli,
and of the Manelli; all the Mozzi, the Scali, Gherardini, Cavalcanti,
Malespini, Bostichi, Giandonati, Vecchietti, and Arrigucci. To these
were joined many families of the people, and all the Ghibellines then
in Florence, so that their great numbers gave them almost the entire
government of the city.

The Donati, at the head of whom was Corso, joined the Nera party, to
which also adhered those members of the above-named families who did not
take part with the Bianchi; and besides these, the whole of the Pazzi,
the Bisdomini, Manieri, Bagnesi, Tornaquinci, Spini, Buondelmonti,
Gianfigliazzi, and the Brunelleschi. Nor did the evil confine itself to
the city alone, for the whole country was divided upon it, so that the
Captains of the Six Parts, and whoever were attached to the Guelphic
party or the well-being of the republic, were very much afraid that this
new division would occasion the destruction of the city, and give new
life to the Ghibelline faction. They, therefore, sent again to Pope
Boniface, desiring that, unless he wished that city which had always
been the shield of the church should either be ruined or become
Ghibelline, he would consider some means for her relief. The
pontiff thereupon sent to Florence, as his legate, Cardinal Matteo
d'Acquasparta, a Portuguese, who, finding the Bianchi, as the most
powerful, the least in fear, not quite submissive to him, he interdicted
the city, and left it in anger, so that greater confusion now prevailed
than had done previously to his coming.

The minds of men being in great excitement, it happened that at a
funeral which many of the Donati and the Cerchi attended, they first
came to words and then to arms, from which, however, nothing but merely
tumult resulted at the moment. However, having each retired to their
houses, the Cerchi determined to attack the Donati, but, by the valor
of Corso, they were repulsed and great numbers of them wounded. The city
was in arms. The laws and the Signory were set at nought by the rage
of the nobility, and the best and wisest citizens were full of
apprehension. The Donati and their followers, being the least powerful,
were in the greatest fear, and to provide for their safety they called
together Corso, the Captains of the Parts, and the other leaders of the
Neri, and resolved to apply to the pope to appoint some personage of
royal blood, that he might reform Florence; thinking by this means to
overcome the Bianchi. Their meeting and determination became known to
the Priors, and the adverse party represented it as a conspiracy against
the liberties of the republic. Both parties being in arms, the Signory,
one of whom at that time was the poet Dante, took courage, and from his
advice and prudence, caused the people to rise for the preservation of
order, and being joined by many from the country, they compelled the
leaders of both parties to lay aside their arms, and banished Corso,
with many of the Neri. And as an evidence of the impartiality of their
motives, they also banished many of the Bianchi, who, however, soon
afterward, under pretense of some justifiable cause, returned.

Corso and his friends, thinking the pope favorable to their party,
went to Rome and laid their grievances before him, having previously
forwarded a statement of them in writing. Charles of Valois, brother of
the king of France, was then at the papal court, having been called
into Italy by the king of Naples, to go over into Sicily. The pope,
therefore, at the earnest prayers of the banished Florentines, consented
to send Charles to Florence, till the season suitable for his going to
Sicily should arrive. He therefore came, and although the Bianchi,
who then governed, were very apprehensive, still, as the head of the
Guelphs, and appointed by the pope, they did not dare to oppose him, and
in order to secure his friendship, they gave him authority to dispose of
the city as he thought proper.

Thus authorized, Charles armed all his friends and followers, which step
gave the people so strong a suspicion that he designed to rob them of
their liberty, that each took arms, and kept at his own house, in order
to be ready, if Charles should make any such attempt. The Cerchi and the
leaders of the Bianchi faction had acquired universal hatred by having,
while at the head of the republic, conducted themselves with unbecoming
pride; and this induced Corso and the banished of the Neri party to
return to Florence, knowing well that Charles and the Captains of
the Parts were favorable to them. And while the citizens, for fear of
Charles, kept themselves in arms, Corso, with all the banished, and
followed by many others, entered Florence without the least impediment.
And although Veri de Cerchi was advised to oppose him, he refused to do
so, saying that he wished the people of Florence, against whom he came,
should punish him. However, the contrary happened, for he was welcomed,
not punished by them; and it behooved Veri to save himself by flight.

Corso, having forced the Pinti Gate, assembled his party at San Pietro
Maggiore, near his own house, where, having drawn together a great
number of friends and people desirous of change, he set at liberty
all who had been imprisoned for offenses, whether against the state
or against individuals. He compelled the existing Signory to withdraw
privately to their own houses, elected a new one from the people of the
Neri party, and for five days plundered the leaders of the Bianchi. The
Cerchi, and the other heads of their faction, finding Charles opposed
to them, withdrew from the city, and retired to their strongholds. And
although at first they would not listen to the advice of the pope, they
were now compelled to turn to him for assistance, declaring that instead
of uniting the city, Charles had caused greater disunion than before.
The pope again sent Matteo d'Acquasparta, his legate, who made peace
between the Cerchi and the Donati, and strengthened it with marriages
and new betrothals. But wishing that the Bianchi should participate in
the employments of the government, to which the Neri who were then at
the head of it would not consent, he withdrew, with no more satisfaction
nor less enraged than on the former occasion, and left the city
interdicted for disobedience.

Both parties remained in Florence, and equally discontented; the Neri
from seeing their enemies at hand, and apprehending the loss of their
power, and the Bianchi from finding themselves without either honor or
authority; and to these natural causes of animosity new injuries
were added. Niccolo de' Cerchi, with many of his friends, went to his
estates, and being arrived at the bridge of Affrico, was attacked by
Simone, son of Corso Donati. The contest was obstinate, and one each
side had a sorrowful conclusion; for Niccolo was slain, and Simone was
so severely wounded that he died on the following night.

This event again disturbed the entire city; and although the Neri were
most to blame, they were defended by those who were at the head of
affairs; and before sentence was delivered, a conspiracy of the Bianchi
with Piero Ferrante, one of the barons who had accompanied Charles,
was discovered, by whose assistance they sought to be replaced in the
government. The matter became known from letters addressed to him by the
Cerchi, although some were of opinion that they were not genuine, but
written and pretended to be found, by the Donati, to abate the infamy
which their party had acquired by the death of Niccolo. The whole of
the Cerchi were, however, banished,--with their followers of the Bianchi
party, of whom was Dante the poet,--their property confiscated, and
their houses pulled down. They sought refuge, with a great number of
Ghibellines who had joined them, in many places, seeking fresh fortunes
in new undertakings. Charles, having effected the purpose of his coming,
left the city, and returned to the pope to pursue his enterprise against
Sicily, in which he was neither wiser nor more fortunate than he had
been at Florence; so that with disgrace and the loss of many of his
followers, he withdrew to France.

After the departure of Charles, Florence remained quiet. Corso alone was
restless, thinking he did not possess that sort of authority in the city
which was due to his rank; for the government being in the hands of the
people, he saw the offices of the republic administered by many inferior
to himself. Moved by passions of this kind, he endeavored, under
the pretense of an honorable design, to justify his own dishonorable
purposes, and accused many citizens who had the management of the public
money, of applying it to their private uses, and recommended that they
should be brought to justice and punished. This opinion was adopted by
many who had the same views as himself; and many in ignorance joined
them, thinking Corso actuated only by pure patriotism. On the other
hand, the accused citizens, enjoying the popular favor, defended
themselves, and this difference arose to such a height, that, after
civil means, they had recourse to arms. Of the one party were Corso and
Lottieri, bishop of Florence, with many of the nobility and some of the
people; on the other side were the Signory, with the greater part of
the people; so that skirmishes took place in many parts of the city. The
Signory, seeing their danger great, sent for aid to the Lucchese,
and presently all the people of Lucca were in Florence. With their
assistance the disturbances were settled for the moment, and the people
retained the government and their liberty, without attempting by any
other means to punish the movers of the disorder.

The pope had heard of the tumults at Florence, and sent his legate,
Niccolo da Prato, to settle them, who, being in high reputation both for
his quality, learning, and mode of life, presently acquired so much of
the people's confidence, that authority was given him to establish such
a government as he should think proper. As he was of Ghibelline origin,
he determined to recall the banished; but designing first to gain the
affections of the lower orders, he renewed the ancient companies of
the people, which increased the popular power and reduced that of the
nobility. The legate, thinking the multitude on his side, now endeavored
to recall the banished, and, after attempting in many ways, none of
which succeeded, he fell so completely under the suspicion of the
government, that he was compelled to quit the city, and returned to the
pope in great wrath, leaving Florence full of confusion and suffering
under an interdict. Neither was the city disturbed with one division
alone, but by many; first the enmity between the people and the
nobility, then that of the Ghibellines and the Guelphs, and lastly, of
the Bianchi and the Neri. All the citizens were, therefore, in arms, for
many were dissatisfied with the departure of the legate, and wished for
the return of the banished. The first who set this disturbance on foot
were the Medici and the Guinigi, who, with the legate, had discovered
themselves in favor of the rebels; and thus skirmishes took place in
many parts of the city.

In addition to these evils a fire occurred, which first broke out at the
garden of St. Michael, in the houses of the Abati; it thence extended to
those of the Capoinsacchi, and consumed them, with those of the Macci,
Amieri, Toschi, Cipriani, Lamberti, Cavalcanti, and the whole of the New
Market; from thence it spread to the gate of St. Maria, and burned it to
the ground; turning from the old bridge, it destroyed the houses of the
Gherardini, Pulci, Amidei, and Lucardesi, and with these so many others
that the number amounted to seventeen hundred. It was the opinion
of many that this fire occurred by accident during the heat of the
disturbances. Others affirm that it was begun willfully by Neri Abati,
prior of St. Pietro Scarragio, a dissolute character, fond of mischief,
who, seeing the people occupied with the combat, took the opportunity
of committing a wicked act, for which the citizens, being thus employed,
could offer no remedy. And to insure his success, he set fire to the
house of his own brotherhood, where he had the best opportunity of doing
it. This was in the year 1304, Florence being afflicted both with fire
and the sword. Corso Donati alone remained unarmed in so many tumults;
for he thought he would more easily become the arbitrator between the
contending parties when, weary of strife, they should be inclined to
accommodation. They laid down their arms, however, rather from satiety
of evil than from any desire of union; and the only consequence was,
that the banished were not recalled, and the party which favored them
remained inferior.



CHAPTER V

The emigrants attempt to re-enter Florence, but are not allowed to do
so--The companies of the people restored--Restless conduct of
Corso Donati--The ruin of Corso Donati--Corso Donati accused
and condemned--Riot at the house of Corso--Death of Corso--His
character--Fruitless attempt of the Emperor Henry against the
Florentines--The emigrants are restored to the city--The citizens place
themselves under the king of Naples for five years--War with Uguccione
della Faggiuola--The Florentines routed--Florence withdraws herself
from subjection to King Robert, and expels the Count Novello--Lando
d'Agobbio--His tyranny--His departure.

The legate being returned to Rome, and hearing of the new disturbance
which had occurred, persuaded the pope that if he wished to unite the
Florentines, it would be necessary to have twelve of the first citizens
appear before him, and having thus removed the principal causes of
disunion, he might easily put a stop to it. The pontiff took this
advice, and the citizens, among whom was Corso Donati, obeyed the
summons. These having left the city, the legate told the exiles that
now, when the city was deprived of her leaders, was the time for them
to return. They, therefore, having assembled, came to Florence, and
entering by a part of the wall not yet completed, proceeded to the
piazza of St. Giovanni. It is worthy of remark, that those who, a short
time previously, when they came unarmed and begged to be restored to
their country, had fought for their return, now, when they saw them in
arms and resolved to enter by force, took arms to oppose them (so much
more was the common good esteemed than private friendship), and being
joined by the rest of the citizens, compelled them to return to the
places whence they had come. They failed in their undertaking by having
left part of their force at Lastra, and by not having waited the arrival
of Tolosetto Uberti, who had to come from Pistoia with three hundred
horse; for they thought celerity rather than numbers would give them the
victory; and it often happens, in similar enterprises, that delay robs
us of the occasion, and too great anxiety to be forward prevents us of
the power, or makes us act before we are properly prepared.

The banished having retired, Florence again returned to her old
divisions; and in order to deprive the Cavalcanti of their authority,
the people took from them the Stinche, a castle situated in the Val
di Greve, and anciently belonging to the family. And as those who were
taken in it were the first who were put into the new prisons, the latter
were, and still continue, named after it,--the Stinche. The leaders of
the republic also re-established the companies of the people, and gave
them the ensigns that were first used by the companies of the Arts; the
heads of which were called Gonfaloniers of the companies and colleagues
of the Signory; and ordered, that when any disturbance arose they should
assist the Signory with arms, and in peace with counsel. To the two
ancient rectors they added an executor, or sheriff, who, with the
Gonfaloniers, was to aid in repressing the insolence of the nobility.

In the meantime the pope died. Corso, with the other citizens, returned
from Rome; and all would have been well if his restless mind had not
occasioned new troubles. It was his common practice to be of a contrary
opinion to the most powerful men in the city; and whatever he saw the
people inclined to do, he exercised his utmost influence to effect,
in order to attach them to himself; so that he was a leader in all
differences, at the head of every new scheme, and whoever wished to
obtain anything extraordinary had recourse to him. This conduct caused
him to be hated by many of the highest distinction; and their hatred
increased to such a degree that the Neri faction to which he belonged,
became completely divided; for Corso, to attain his ends, had availed
himself of private force and authority, and of the enemies of the state.
But so great was the influence attached to his person, that everyone
feared him. Nevertheless, in order to strip him of the popular favor
(which by this means may easily be done), a report was set on foot that
he intended to make himself prince of the city; and to the design his
conduct gave great appearance of probability, for his way of living
quite exceeded all civil bounds; and the opinion gained further
strength, upon his taking to wife a daughter of Uguccione della
Faggiuola, head of the Ghibelline and Bianchi faction, and one of the
most powerful men in Tuscany.

When this marriage became known it gave courage to his adversaries, and
they took arms against him; for the same reason the people ceased
to defend him, and the greater part of them joined the ranks of his
enemies, the leaders of whom were Rosso della Tosa, Pazino dei Pazzi,
Geri Spini, and Berto Brunelleschi. These, with their followers, and the
greater part of the people, assembled before the palace of the Signory,
by whose command a charge was made before Piero Branca, captain of the
people, against Corso, of intending, with the aid of Uguccione, to usurp
the government. He was then summoned, and for disobedience, declared
a rebel; nor did two hours pass over between the accusation and the
sentence. The judgment being given, the Signory, with the companies of
the people under their ensigns, went in search of him, who, although
seeing himself abandoned by many of his followers, aware of the sentence
against him, the power of the Signory, and the multitude of his enemies,
remained undaunted, and fortified his houses, in the hope of defending
them till Uguccione, for whom he had sent, should come to his Relief.
His residences, and the streets approaching them, were barricaded and
taken possession of by his partisans, who defended them so bravely that
the enemy, although in great numbers, could not force them, and the
battle became one of the hottest, with wounds and death on all sides.
But the people, finding they could not drive them from their ground,
took possession of the adjoining houses, and by unobserved passages
obtained entry. Corso, thus finding himself surrounded by his foes, no
longer retaining any hope of assistance from Uguccione, and without a
chance of victory, thought only of effecting his personal safety, and
with Gherardo Bordoni, and some of his bravest and most trusted friends,
fought a passage through the thickest of their enemies, and effected
their escape from the city by the Gate of the Cross. They were, however,
pursued by vast numbers, and Gherardo was slain upon the bridge of
Affrico by Boccaccio Cavicciulli. Corso was overtaken and made
prisoner by a party of Catalan horse, in the service of the Signory, at
Rovezzano. But when approaching Florence, that he might avoid being seen
and torn to pieces by his victorious enemies, he allowed himself to fall
from horseback, and being down, one of those who conducted him cut his
throat. The body was found by the monks of San Salvi, and buried without
any ceremony due to his rank. Such was the end of Corso, to whom his
country and the Neri faction were indebted for much both of good and
evil; and if he had possessed a cooler spirit he would have left behind
him a more happy memory. Nevertheless, he deserves to be enumerated
among the most distinguished men our city has produced. True it is, that
his restless conduct made both his country and his party forgetful of
their obligation to him. The same cause also produced his miserable
end, and brought many troubles upon both his friends and his country.
Uguccione, coming to the assistance of his relative, learned at Remoli
that Corso had been overcome by the people, and finding that he could
not render him any assistance, in order to avoid bringing evil upon
himself without occasion, he returned home.

After the death of Corso, which occurred in the year 1308, the
disturbances were appeased, and the people lived quietly till it was
reported that the Emperor Henry was coming into Italy, and with him all
the Florentine emigrants, to whom he had promised restoration to their
country. The leaders of the government thought, that in order to lessen
the number of their enemies, it would be well to recall, of their own
will, all who had been expelled, excepting such as the law had expressly
forbidden to return. Of the number not admitted, were the greater part
of the Ghibellines, and some of those of the Bianchi faction, among whom
were Dante Alighieri, the sons of Veri de' Cerchi and of Giano della
Bella. Besides this they sent for aid to Robert, king of Naples, and not
being able to obtain it of him as friends, they gave their city to him
for five years, that he might defend them as his own people. The emperor
entered Italy by the way of Pisa, and proceeded by the marshes to Rome,
where he was crowned in the year 1312. Then, having determined to subdue
the Florentines, he approached their city by the way of Perugia and
Arezzo, and halted with his army at the monastery of San Salvi, about
a mile from Florence, where he remained fifty days without effecting
anything. Despairing of success against Florence, he returned to Pisa,
where he entered into an agreement with Frederick, king of Sicily,
to undertake the conquest of Naples, and proceeded with his people
accordingly; but while filled with the hope of victory, and carrying
dismay into the heart of King Robert, having reached Buonconvento, he
died.

Shortly after this, Uguccione della Faggiuola, having by means of the
Ghibelline party become lord of Pisa and of Lucca, caused, with the
assistance of these cities, very serious annoyance to the neighbouring
places. In order to effect their relief the Florentines requested
King Robert would allow his brother Piero to take the command of their
armies. On the other hand, Uguccione continued to increase his power;
and either by force or fraud obtained possession of many castles in the
Val d'Arno and the Val di Nievole; and having besieged Monte Cataini,
the Florentines found it would be necessary to send to its relief, that
they might not see him burn and destroy their whole territory. Having
drawn together a large army, they entered the Val di Nievole where they
came up with Uguccione, and were routed after a severe battle in which
Piero the king's brother and 2,000 men were slain; but the body of
the Prince was never found. Neither was the victory a joyful one to
Uguccione; for one of his sons, and many of the leaders of his army,
fell in the strife.

The Florentines after this defeat fortified their territory, and King
Robert sent them, for commander of their forces, the Count d'Andria,
usually called Count Novello, by whose deportment, or because it is
natural to the Florentines to find every state tedious, the city,
notwithstanding the war with Uguccione, became divided into friends and
enemies of the king. Simon della Tosa, the Magalotti, and certain others
of the people who had attained greater influence in the government than
the rest, were leaders of the party against the king. By these means
messengers were sent to France, and afterward into Germany, to solicit
leaders and forces that they might drive out the count, whom the king
had appointed governor; but they failed of obtaining any. Nevertheless
they did not abandon their undertaking, but still desirous of one whom
they might worship, after an unavailing search in France and Germany,
they discovered him at Agobbio, and having expelled the Count Novello,
caused Lando d'Agobbio to be brought into the city as Bargello (sheriff),
and gave him the most unlimited power of the citizens. This man was
cruel and rapacious; and going through the country accompanied with an
armed force, he put many to death at the mere instigation of those who
had endowed him with authority. His insolence rose to such a height,
that he stamped base metal with the impression used upon the money of
the state, and no one had sufficient courage to oppose him, so powerful
had he become by the discords of Florence. Great, certainly, but unhappy
city! which neither the memory of past divisions, the fear of her
enemies, nor a king's authority, could unite for her own advantage; so
that she found herself in a state of the utmost wretchedness, harassed
without by Uguccione, and plundered within by Lando d'Agobbio.

The friends of the king and those who opposed Lando and his followers,
were either of noble families or the highest of the people, and all
Guelphs; but their adversaries being in power they could not discover
their minds without incurring the greatest danger. Being, however,
determined to deliver themselves from such disgraceful tyranny, they
secretly wrote to King Robert, requesting him to appoint for his vicar
in Florence Count Guido da Battifolle. The king complied; and the
opposite party, although the Signory were opposed to the king, on
account of the good quality of the count, did not dare to resist him.
Still his authority was not great, because the Signory and Gonfaloniers
of the companies were in favor of Lando and his party.

During these troubles, the daughter of King Albert of Bohemia passed
through Florence, in search of her husband, Charles, the son of King
Robert, and was received with the greatest respect by the friends of the
king, who complained to her of the unhappy state of the city, and of the
tyranny of Lando and his partisans; so that through her influence and
the exertions of the king's friends, the citizens were again united, and
before her departure, Lando was stripped of all authority and send back
to Agobbio, laden with blood and plunder. In reforming the government,
the sovereignty of the city was continued to the king for another three
years, and as there were then in office seven Signors of the party
of Lando, six more were appointed of the king's friends, and some
magistracies were composed of thirteen Signors; but not long afterward
the number was reduced to seven according to ancient custom.



CHAPTER VI

War with Castruccio--Castruccio marches against Prato and retires
without making any attempt--The emigrants not being allowed to return,
endeavor to enter the city by force, and are repulsed--Change in
the mode of electing the great officers of state--The Squittini
established--The Florentines under Raymond of Cardona are routed
by Castruccio at Altopascio--Treacherous designs of Raymond--The
Florentines give the sovereignty of the city to Charles duke of Cambria,
who appoints the duke of Athens for his vicar--The duke of Calabria
comes to Florence--The Emperor Louis of Bavaria visits Italy--The
excitement he produces--Death of Castruccio and of Charles duke of
Calabria--Reform of government.

About the same time, Uguccione lost the sovereignty of Lucca and of
Pisa, and Castruccio Castracani, a citizen of Lucca, became lord of
them, who, being a young man, bold and fierce, and fortunate in his
enterprises, in a short time became the head of the Ghibellines in
Tuscany. On this account the discords among the Florentines were
laid aside for some years, at first to abate the increasing power
of Castruccio, and afterward to unite their means for mutual defense
against him. And in order to give increased strength and efficacy to
their counsels, the Signory appointed twelve citizens whom they called
Buonomini, or good men, without whose advice and consent nothing of
any importance could be carried into effect. The conclusion of the
sovereignty of King Robert being come, the citizens took the government
into their own hands, reappointed the usual rectors and magistracies,
and were kept united by the dread of Castruccio, who, after many efforts
against the lords of Lunigiano, attacked Prato, to the relief of which
the Florentines having resolved to go, shut up their shops and houses,
and proceeded thither in a body, amounting to twenty thousand foot and
one thousand five hundred horse. And in order to reduce the number of
Castruccio's friends and augment their own, the Signory declared that
every rebel of the Guelphic party who should come to the relief of Prato
would be restored to his country; they thus increased their army with an
addition of four thousand men. This great force being quickly brought
to Prato, alarmed Castruccio so much, that without trying the fortune
of battle, he retired toward Lucca. Upon this, disturbances arose in the
Florentine camp between the nobility and the people, the latter of whom
wished to pursue the foe and destroy him; the former were for returning
home, saying they had done enough for Prato in hazarding the safety
of Florence on its account, which they did not regret under the
circumstances, but now, that necessity no longer existing, the propriety
of further risk ceased also, as there was little to be gained and much
to lose. Not being able to agree, the question was referred to the
Signory, among whom the difference of opinion was equally great; and
as the matter spread throughout the city, the people drew together, and
used such threatening language against the nobility that they, being
apprehensive for their safety, yielded; but the resolution being adopted
too late, and by many unwillingly, gave the enemy time to withdraw in
safety to Lucca.

This unfortunate circumstance made the people so indignant against
the great that the Signory refused to perform the promise made to
the exiles, and the latter, anticipating the fact, determined to be
beforehand, and were at the gates of Florence to gain admittance into
the city before the rest of the forces; but their design did not take
effect, for their purpose being foreseen, they were repulsed by those
who had remained at home. They then endeavored to acquire by entreaty
what they had failed to obtain by force; and sent eight men as
ambassadors to the Signory, to remind them of the promise given, and
of the dangers they had undergone, in hope of the reward which had been
held out to them. And although the nobility, who felt the obligation on
account of their having particularly undertaken to fulfill the promise
for which the Signory had bound themselves, used their utmost exertion
in favor of the exiles, so great was the anger of the multitude on
account of their only partial success against Castruccio, that they
could not obtain their admission. This occasioned cost and dishonor to
the city; for many of the nobility, taking offense at this proceeding,
endeavored to obtain by arms that which had been refused to their
prayers, and agreed with the exiles that they should come armed to the
city, and that those within would arm themselves in their defense. But
the affair was discovered before the appointed day arrived, so that
those without found the city in arms, and prepared to resist them. So
completely subdued were those within, that none dared to take arms; and
thus the undertaking was abandoned, without any advantage having
been obtained by the party. After the departure of the exiles it was
determined to punish those who had been instrumental in bringing them
to the city; but, although everyone knew who were the delinquents,
none ventured to name and still less to accuse them. It was, therefore,
resolved that in order to come at the truth, everyone should write
the names of those he believed to be guilty, and present the writing
secretly to the Capitano. By this means, Amerigo Donati, Teghiajo,
Frescobaldi, and Lotteringo Gherardini were accused; but, the judges
being more favorably disposed to them than, perhaps, their misdeeds
deserved, each escaped by paying a fine.

The tumults which arose in Florence from the coming of the rebels to the
gates, showed that one leader was insufficient for the companies of
the people; they, therefore, determined that in future each should have
three or four; and to every Gonfalonier two or three Pennonieri (pennon
bearers) were added, so that if the whole body were not drawn out, a
part might operate under one of them. And as happens in republics, after
any disturbance, some old laws are annulled and others renewed, so
on this occasion, as it had been previously customary to appoint the
Signory for a time only, the then existing Signors and the Colleagues,
feeling themselves possessed of sufficient power, assumed the authority
to fix upon the Signors that would have to sit during the next forty
months, by putting their names into a bag or purse, and drawing them
every two months. But, before the expiration of the forty months, many
citizens were jealous that their names had not been deposited among
the rest, and a new emborsation was made. From this beginning arose the
custom of emborsing or enclosing the names of all who should take office
in any of the magistracies for a long time to come, as well those whose
offices employed them within the city as those abroad, though previously
the councils of the retiring magistrates had elected those who were to
succeed them. These emborsations were afterward called Squittini, or
pollings,--and it was thought they would prevent much trouble to the
city, and remove the cause of those tumults which every three, or at
most five, years, took place upon the creation of magistrates, from the
number of candidates for office. And not being able to adopt a better
expedient, they made use of this, but did not observe the defects which
lay concealed under such a trivial accommodation.

In 1325, Castruccio, having taken possession of Pistoia, became so
powerful that the Florentines, fearing his greatness, resolved, before
he should get himself firmly seated in his new conquest, to attack him
and withdraw it from his authority. Of their citizens and friends they
mustered an army amounting to 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse, and with this
body encamped before Altopascio, with the intention of taking the place
and thus preventing it from relieving Pistoia. Being successful in the
first part of their design, they marched toward Lucca, and laid the
country waste in their progress; but from the little prudence and less
integrity of their leader, Ramondo di Cardona, they made but small
progress; for he, having observed them upon former occasions very
prodigal of their liberty, placing it sometimes in the hands of a king,
at others in those of a legate, or persons of even inferior quality,
thought, if he could bring them into some difficulty, it might easily
happen that they would make him their prince. Nor did he fail frequently
to mention these matters, and required to have that authority in the
city which had been given him over the army, endeavoring to show that
otherwise he could not enforce the obedience requisite to a leader. As
the Florentines did not consent to this, he wasted time, and allowed
Castruccio to obtain the assistance which the Visconti and other tyrants
of Lombardy had promised him, and thus become very strong. Ramondo,
having willfully let the opportunity of victory pass away, now
found himself unable to escape; for Castruccio coming up with him at
Altopascio, a great battle ensued in which many citizens were slain and
taken prisoners, and among the former fell Ramondo, who received from
fortune that reward of bad faith and mischievous counsels which he had
richly deserved from the Florentines. The injury they suffered from
Castruccio, after the battle, in plunder, prisoners, destruction,
and burning of property, is quite indescribable; for, without any
opposition, during many months, he led his predatory forces wherever he
thought proper, and it seemed sufficient to the Florentines if, after
such a terrible event, they could save their city.

Still they were not so absolutely cast down as to prevent them from
raising great sums of money, hiring troops, and sending to their friends
for assistance; but all they could do was insufficient to restrain such
a powerful enemy; so that they were obliged to offer the sovereignty to
Charles duke of Calabria, son of King Robert, if they could induce him
to come to their defense; for these princes, being accustomed to rule
Florence, preferred her obedience to her friendship. But Charles, being
engaged in the wars of Sicily, and therefore unable to undertake the
sovereignty of the city, sent in his stead Walter, by birth a Frenchman,
and duke of Athens. He, as viceroy, took possession of the city, and
appointed the magistracies according to his own pleasure; but his mode
of proceeding was quite correct, and so completely contrary to his real
nature, that everyone respected him.

The affairs of Sicily being composed, Charles came to Florence with a
thousand horse. He made his entry into the city in July, 1326, and
his coming prevented further pillage of the Florentine territory by
Castruccio. However, the influence which they acquired without the city
was lost within her walls, and the evils which they did not suffer from
their enemies were brought upon them by their friends; for the Signory
could not do anything without the consent of the duke of Calabria,
who, in the course of one year, drew from the people 400,000 florins,
although by the agreement entered into with him, the sum was not to
exceed 200,000; so great were the burdens with which either himself or
his father constantly oppressed them.

To these troubles were added new jealousies and new enemies; for the
Ghibellines of Lombardy became so alarmed upon the arrival of Charles in
Tuscany, that Galeazzo Visconti and the other Lombard tyrants, by money
and promises, induced Louis of Bavaria, who had lately been elected
emperor contrary to the wish of the pope, to come into Italy. After
passing through Lombardy he entered Tuscany, and with the assistance
of Castruccio, made himself master of Pisa, from whence, having been
pacified with sums of money, he directed his course towards Rome. This
caused the duke of Calabria to be apprehensive for the safety of Naples;
he therefore left Florence, and appointed as his viceroy Filippo da
Saggineto.

After the departure of the emperor, Castruccio made himself master of
Pisa, but the Florentines, by a treaty with Pistoia, withdrew her from
obedience to him. Castruccio then besieged Pistoia, and persevered
with so much vigor and resolution, that although the Florentines often
attempted to relieve her, by attacking first his army and then his
country, they were unable either by force or policy to remove him; so
anxious was he to punish the Pistolesi and subdue the Florentines. At
length the people of Pistoia were compelled to receive him for their
sovereign; but this event, although greatly to his glory, proved but
little to his advantage, for upon his return to Lucca he died. And as
one event either of good or evil seldom comes alone, at Naples also died
Charles duke of Calabria and lord of Florence, so that in a short time,
beyond the expectation of their most sanguine hopes, the Florentines
found themselves delivered from the domination of the one and the fear
of the other. Being again free, they set about the reformation of the
city, annulled all the old councils, and created two new ones, the one
composed of 300 citizens from the class of the people, the other of 250
from the nobility and the people.

The first was called the Council of the People, the other the Council of
the Commune.



CHAPTER VII

The Emperor at Rome--The Florentines refuse to purchase Lucca, and
repent of it--Enterprises of the Florentines--Conspiracy of the Bardi
and the Frescobaldi--The conspiracy discovered and checked--Maffeo da
Marradi appeases the tumult--Lucca is purchased by the Florentines
and taken by the Pisans--The duke of Athens at Florence--The nobility
determine to make him prince of the city.

The emperor, being arrived at Rome, created an anti-pope, did many
things in opposition to the church, and attempted many others, but
without effect, so that at last he retired with disgrace, and went to
Pisa, where, either because they were not paid, or from disaffection,
about 800 German horse mutinied, and fortified themselves at Montechiaro
upon the Ceruglio; and when the emperor had left Pisa to go into
Lombardy, they took possession of Lucca and drove out Francesco
Castracani, whom he had left there. Designing to turn their conquest to
account, they offered it to the Florentines for 80,000 florins, which,
by the advice of Simone della Tosa, was refused. This resolution, if
they had remained in it, would have been of the greatest utility to
the Florentines; but as they shortly afterward changed their minds,
it became most pernicious; for although at the time they might have
obtained peaceful possession of her for a small sum and would not,
they afterward wished to have her and could not, even for a much larger
amount; which caused many and most hurtful changes to take place in
Florence. Lucca, being refused by the Florentines, was purchased by
Gherardino Spinoli, a Genoese, for 30,000 florins. And as men are often
less anxious to take what is in their power than desirous of that which
they cannot attain, as soon as the purchase of Gherardino became known,
and for how small a sum it had been bought, the people of Florence were
seized with an extreme desire to have it, blaming themselves and those
by whose advice they had been induced to reject the offer made to them.
And in order to obtain by force what they had refused to purchase, they
sent troops to plunder and overrun the country of the Lucchese.

About this time the emperor left Italy. The anti-pope, by means of the
Pisans, became a prisoner in France; and the Florentines from the death
of Castruccio, which occurred in 1328, remained in domestic peace till
1340, and gave their undivided attention to external affairs, while many
wars were carried on in Lombardy, occasioned by the coming of John king
of Bohemia, and in Tuscany, on account of Lucca. During this period
Florence was ornamented with many new buildings, and by the advice of
Giotto, the most distinguished painter of his time, they built the tower
of Santa Reparata. Besides this, the waters of the Arno having, in 1333,
risen twelve feet above their ordinary level, destroyed some of the
bridges and many buildings, all which were restored with great care and
expense.

In the year 1340, new sources of disagreement arose. The great had two
ways of increasing or preserving their power; the one, so to restrain
the emborsation of magistrates, that the lot always fell upon themselves
or their friends; the other, that having the election of the rectors,
they were always favorable to their party. This second mode they
considered of so great importance, that the ordinary rectors not being
sufficient for them, they on some occasions elected a third, and at
this time they had made an extraordinary appointment, under the title
of captain of the guard, of Jacopo Gabrielli of Agobbio, and endowed him
with unlimited authority over the citizens. This man, under the sanction
of those who governed, committed constant outrages; and among those whom
he injured were Piero de' Bardi and Bardo Frescobaldi. These being of
the nobility, and naturally proud, could not endure that a stranger,
supported by a few powerful men, should without cause injure them with
impunity, and consequently entered into a conspiracy against him and
those by whom he was supported. They were joined by many noble families,
and some of the people, who were offended with the tyranny of those in
power. Their plan was, that each should bring into his house a number of
armed men, and on the morning after the day of All Saints, when almost
all would be in the temples praying for their dead, they should take
arms, kill the Capitano and those who were at the head of affairs, and
then, with a new Signory and new ordinances, reform the government.

But, as the more a dangerous business is considered, the less willingly
it is undertaken, it commonly happens, when there is any time allowed
between the determining upon a perilous enterprise and its execution,
that the conspiracy by one means or another becomes known. Andrea de'
Bardi was one of the conspirators, and upon reconsideration of the
matter, the fear of the punishment operated more powerfully upon him
than the desire of revenge, and he disclosed the affair to Jacopo
Alberti, his brother-in-law. Jacopo acquainted the Priors, and they
informed the government. And as the danger was near, All Saints' day
being just at hand, many citizens met together in the palace; and
thinking their peril increased by delay, they insisted that the Signory
should order the alarm to be rung, and called the people together in
arms. Taldo Valori was at this time Gonfalonier, and Francesco Salviati
one of the Signory, who, being relatives of the Bardi, were unwilling to
summon the people with the bell, alleging as a reason that it is by
no means well to assemble them in arms upon every slight occasion,
for power put into the hands of an unrestrained multitude was never
beneficial; that it is an easy matter to excite them to violence, but
a difficult thing to restrain them; and that, therefore, it would be
taking a more prudent course if they were to inquire into the truth of
the affair, and punish the delinquents by the civil authority, than to
attempt, upon a simple information, to correct it by such a tumultuous
means, and thus hazard the safety of the city. None would listen to
these remarks; the Signory were assailed with insolent behavior and
indecent expressions, and compelled to sound the alarm, upon which the
people presently assembled in arms. On the other hand, the Bardi and the
Frescobaldi, finding themselves discovered, that they might conquer
with glory or die without shame, armed themselves, in the hope that they
would be able to defend that part of the city beyond the river, where
their houses were situated; and they fortified the bridge in expectation
of assistance, which they expected from the nobles and their friends in
the country. Their design was frustrated by the people who, in common
with themselves, occupied this part of the city; for these took arms
in favor of the Signory, so that, seeing themselves thus circumstanced,
they abandoned the bridges, and betook themselves to the street in which
the Bardi resided, as being a stronger situation than any other; and
this they defended with great bravery.

Jacopo d'Agobbio, knowing the whole conspiracy was directed against
himself, in fear of death, terrified and vanquished, kept himself
surrounded with forces near the palace of the Signory; but the other
rectors, who were much less blamable, discovered greater courage, and
especially the podesta or provost, whose name was Maffeo da Marradi. He
presented himself among the combatants without any fear, and passing the
bridge of the Rubaconte amid the swords of the Bardi, made a sign that
he wished to speak to them. Upon this, their reverence for the man, his
noble demeanor, and the excellent qualities he was known to possess,
caused an immediate cessation of the combat, and induced them to listen
to him patiently. He very gravely, but without the use of any bitter or
aggravating expressions, blamed their conspiracy, showed the danger they
would incur if they still contended against the popular feeling, gave
them reason to hope their complaints would be heard and mercifully
considered, and promised that he himself would use his endeavors in
their behalf. He then returned to the Signory, and implored them to
spare the blood of the citizens, showing the impropriety of judging them
unheard, and at length induced them to consent that the Bardi and the
Frescobaldi, with their friends, should leave the city, and without
impediment be allowed to retire to their castles. Upon their departure
the people being again disarmed, the Signory proceeded against those
only of the Bardi and Frescobaldi families who had taken arms. To lessen
their power, they bought of the Bardi the castle of Mangona and that
of Vernia; and enacted a law which provided that no citizen should be
allowed to possess a castle or fortified place within twenty miles of
Florence.

After a few months, Stiatta Frescobaldi was beheaded, and many of his
family banished. Those who governed, not satisfied with having subdued
the Bardi and the Frescobaldi, as is most commonly the case, the more
authority they possessed the worse use they made of it and the more
insolent they became. As they had hitherto had one captain of the guard
who afflicted the city, they now appointed another for the country, with
unlimited authority, to the end that those whom they suspected might
abide neither within nor without. And they excited them to such
excesses against the whole of the nobility, that these were driven to
desperation, and ready to sell both themselves and the city to obtain
revenge. The occasion at length came, and they did not fail to use it.

The troubles of Tuscany and Lombardy had brought the city of Lucca under
the rule of Mastino della Scala, lord of Verona, who, though bound by
contract to assign her to the Florentines, had refused to do so; for,
being lord of Parma, he thought he should be able to retain her, and did
not trouble himself about his breach of faith. Upon this the Florentines
joined the Venetians, and with their assistance brought Mastino to
the brink of ruin. They did not, however, derive any benefit from
this beyond the slight satisfaction of having conquered him; for the
Venetians, like all who enter into league with less powerful states than
themselves, having acquired Trevigi and Vicenza, made peace with Mastino
without the least regard for the Florentines. Shortly after this, the
Visconti, lords of Milan, having taken Parma from Mastino, he found
himself unable to retain Lucca, and therefore determined to sell it. The
competitors for the purchase were the Florentines and the Pisans; and in
the course of the treaty the Pisans, finding that the Florentines, being
the richer people, were about to obtain it, had recourse to arms,
and, with the assistance of the Visconti, marched against Lucca. The
Florentines did not, on that account, withdraw from the purchase, but
having agreed upon the terms with Mastino, paid part of the money,
gave security for the remainder, and sent Naddo Rucellai, Giovanni
di Bernadino de' Medici, and Rosso di Ricciardo de' Ricci, to take
possession, who entered Lucca by force, and Mastino's people delivered
the city to them. Nevertheless, the Pisans continued the siege, and the
Florentines used their utmost endeavors to relieve her; but after a long
war, loss of money, and accumulation of disgrace, they were compelled to
retire, and the Pisans became lords of Lucca.

The loss of this city, as in like cases commonly happens, exasperated
the people of Florence against the members of the government; at every
street corner and public place they were openly censured, and the entire
misfortune was laid to the charge of their greediness and mismanagement.
At the beginning of the war, twenty citizens had been appointed to
undertake the direction of it, who appointed Malatesta da Rimini to
the command of the forces. He having exhibited little zeal and less
prudence, they requested assistance from Robert king of Naples, and he
sent them Walter duke of Athens, who, as Providence would have it,
to bring about the approaching evils, arrived at Florence just at the
moment when the undertaking against Lucca had entirely failed. Upon this
the Twenty, seeing the anger of the people, thought to inspire them with
fresh hopes by the appointment of a new leader, and thus remove, or at
least abate, the causes of calumny against themselves. As there was much
to be feared, and that the duke of Athens might have greater authority
to defend them, they first chose him for their coadjutor, and then
appointed him to the command of the army. The nobility, who were
discontented from the causes above mentioned, having many of them been
acquainted with Walter, when upon a former occasion he had governed
Florence for the duke of Calabria, thought they had now an opportunity,
though with the ruin of the city, of subduing their enemies; for there
was no means of prevailing against those who had oppressed them but of
submitting to the authority of a prince who, being acquainted with the
worth of one party and the insolence of the other, would restrain the
latter and reward the former. To this they added a hope of the benefits
they might derive from him when he had acquired the principality by
their means. They, therefore, took several occasions of being with him
secretly, and entreated he would take the command wholly upon himself,
offering him the utmost assistance in their power. To their influence
and entreaty were also added those of some families of the people; these
were the Peruzzi, Acciajuoli, Antellesi, and Buonaccorsi, who, being
overwhelmed with debts, and without means of their own, wished for those
of others to liquidate them, and, by the slavery of their country,
to deliver themselves from their servitude to their creditors. These
demonstrations excited the ambitious mind of the duke to greater desire
of dominion, and in order to gain himself the reputation of strict
equity and justice, and thus increase his favor with the plebeians, he
prosecuted those who had conducted the war against Lucca, condemned many
to pay fines, others to exile, and put to death Giovanni de' Medici,
Naddo Rucellai, and Guglielmo Altoviti.



CHAPTER VIII

The Duke of Athens requires to be made prince of Florence--The Signory
address the duke upon the subject--The plebeians proclaim him prince
of Florence for life--Tyrannical proceedings of the duke--The city
disgusted with him--Conspiracies against the duke--The duke discovers
the conspiracies, and becomes terrified--The city rises against him--He
is besieged in the palace--Measures adopted by the citizens for
reform of the government--The duke is compelled to withdraw from the
city--Miserable deaths of Guglielmo da Scesi and his son--Departure of
the duke of Athens--His character.

These executions greatly terrified the middle class of citizens, but
gave satisfaction to the great and to the plebeians;--to the latter,
because it is their nature to delight in evil; and to the former, by
thus seeing themselves avenged of the many wrongs they had suffered from
the people. When the duke passed along the streets he was hailed with
loud cheers, the boldness of his proceedings was praised, and both
parties joined in open entreaties that he would search out the faults of
the citizens, and punish them.

The office of the Twenty began to fall into disuse, while the power
of the duke became great, and the influence of fear excessive; so that
everyone, in order to appear friendly to him, caused his arms to be
painted over their houses, and the name alone was all he needed to be
absolutely prince. Thinking himself upon such a footing that he might
safely attempt anything, he gave the Signory to understand that he
judged it necessary for the good of the city, that the sovereignty
should be freely given to him, and that as the rest of the citizens were
willing that it should be so, he desired they would also consent. The
Signory, notwithstanding many had foreseen the ruin of their country,
were much disturbed at this demand; and although they were aware of the
dangerous position in which they stood, that they might not be wanting
in their duty, resolutely refused to comply. The duke had, in order to
assume a greater appearance of religion and humanity, chosen for his
residence the convent of the Minor Canons of St. Croce, and in order
to carry his evil designs into effect, proclaimed that all the people
should, on the following morning, present themselves before him in the
piazza of the convent. This command alarmed the Signory much more than
his discourse to them had done, and they consulted with those citizens
whom they thought most attached to their country and to liberty; but
they could not devise any better plan, knowing the power of which the
duke was possessed, than to endeavor by entreaty to induce him either to
forego his design or to make his government less intolerable. A party of
them was, therefore, appointed to wait upon him, one of whom addressed
him in the following manner:--

"We appear before you, my lord, induced first by the demand which you
have made, and then by the orders you have given for a meeting of the
people; for it appears to us very clearly, that it is your intention
to effect by extraordinary means the design from which we have hitherto
withheld our consent. It is not, however, our intention to oppose you
with force, but only to show what a heavy charge you take upon yourself,
and the dangerous course you adopt; to the end that you may remember our
advice and that of those who, not by consideration of what is beneficial
for you, but for the gratification of their own unreasonable wishes,
have advised you differently. You are endeavoring to reduce to slavery a
city that has always existed in freedom; for the authority which we
have at times conceded to the kings of Naples was companionship and
not servitude. Have you considered the mighty things which the name
of liberty implies to such a city as this, and how delightful it is to
those who hear it? It has a power which nothing can subdue, time cannot
wear away, nor can any degree of merit in a prince countervail the loss
of it. Consider, my lord, how great the force must be that can keep a
city like this in subjection, no foreign aid would enable you to do it;
neither can you confide in those at home; for they who are at present
your friends, and advise you to adopt the course you now pursue, as soon
as with your assistance they have overcome their enemies, will at once
turn their thoughts toward effecting your destruction, and then take
the government upon themselves. The plebeians, in whom you confide, will
change upon any accident, however trivial; so that in a very short time
you may expect to see the whole city opposed to you, which will produce
both their ruin and your own. Nor will you be able to find any remedy
for this; for princes who have but few enemies may make their government
very secure by the death or banishment of those who are opposed to them;
but when the hatred is universal, no security whatever can be found, for
you cannot tell from what direction the evil may commence; and he who
has to apprehend every man his enemy cannot make himself assured of
anyone. And if you should attempt to secure a friend or two, you would
only increase the dangers of your situation; for the hatred of the
rest would be increased by your success, and they would become more
resolutely disposed to vengeance.

"That time can neither destroy nor abate the desire for freedom is most
certain; for it has been often observed, that those have reassumed their
liberty who in their own persons had never tasted of its charms, and
love it only from remembrance of what they have heard their fathers
relate; and, therefore, when recovered, have preserved it with
indomitable resolution and at every hazard. And even when their
fathers could not remember it, the public buildings, the halls of the
magistracy, and the insignia of free institutions, remind them of it;
and these things cannot fail to be known and greatly desired by every
class of citizens.

"What is it you imagine you can do, that would be an equivalent for
the sweets of liberty, or make men lose the desire of their present
conditions? No; if you were to join the whole of Tuscany to the
Florentine rule, if you were to return to the city daily in triumph
over her enemies, what could it avail? The glory would not be ours,
but yours. We should not acquire fellow-citizens, but partakers of our
bondage, who would serve to sink us still deeper in ignominy. And if
your conduct were in every respect upright, your demeanor amiable, and
your judgments equitable, all these would be insufficient to make you
beloved. If you imagine otherwise, you deceive yourself; for, to one
accustomed to the enjoyment of liberty, the slightest chains feel
heavy, and every tie upon his free soul oppresses him. Besides, it is
impossible to find a violent people associated with a good prince, for
of necessity they must soon become alike, or their difference produce
the ruin of one of them. You may, therefore, be assured, that you
will either have to hold this city by force, to effect which, guards,
castles, and external aid have oft been found insufficient, or be
content with the authority we have conferred; and this we would advise,
reminding you that no dominion can be durable to which the governed do
not consent; and we have no wish to lead you, blinded by ambition, to
such a point that, unable either to stand or advance, you must, to the
great injury of both, of necessity fall."

This discourse did not in the slightest degree soften the obdurate mind
of the duke, who replied that it was not his intention to rob the city
of her liberty, but to restore it to her; for those cities alone are in
slavery that are disunited, while the united are free. As Florence, by
her factions and ambition, had deprived herself of liberty, he should
restore, not take it from her; and as he had been induced to take this
charge upon himself, not from his own ambition, but at the entreaty of
a great number of citizens, they would do well to be satisfied with that
which produced contentment among the rest. With regard to the danger he
might incur, he thought nothing of it; for it was not the part of a good
man to avoid doing good from his apprehension of evil, and it was the
part of a coward to shun a glorious undertaking because some uncertainty
attended the success of the attempt; and he knew he should so
conduct himself, that they would soon see they had entertained great
apprehensions and been in little danger.

The Signory then agreed, finding they could not do better, that on the
following morning the people should be assembled in their accustomed
place of meeting, and with their consent the Signory should confer
upon the duke the sovereignty of the city for one year, on the same
conditions as it had been intrusted to the duke of Calabria. It was upon
the 8th of November, 1342, when the duke, accompanied by Giovanni della
Tosa and all his confederates, with many other citizens, came to the
piazza or court of the palace, and having, with the Signory mounted upon
the ringhiera, or rostrum (as the Florentines call those steps which
lead to the palace), the agreement which had been entered into between
the Signory and himself was read. When they had come to the passage
which gave the government to him for one year, the people shouted, "FOR
LIFE." Upon this, Francesco Rustichelli, one of the Signory, arose to
speak, and endeavored to abate the tumult and procure a hearing; but the
mob, with their hootings, prevented him from being heard by anyone; so
that with the consent of the people the duke was elected, not for one
year merely, but for life. He was then borne through the piazza by the
crowd, shouting his name as they proceeded.

It is the custom that he who is appointed to the guard of the palace
shall, in the absence of the Signory, remain locked within. This office
was at that time held by Rinieri di Giotto, who, bribed by the friends
of the duke, without waiting for any force, admitted him immediately.
The Signory, terrified and dishonored, retired to their own houses; the
palace was plundered by the followers of the duke, the Gonfalon of the
people torn to pieces, and the arms of the duke placed over the palace.
All this happened to the indescribable sorrow of good men, though to
the satisfaction of those who, either from ignorance or malignity, were
consenting parties.

The duke, having acquired the sovereignty of the city, in order to strip
those of all authority who had been defenders of her liberty, forbade
the Signory to assemble in the palace, and appointed a private dwelling
for their use. He took their colors from the Gonfaloniers of the
companies of the people; abolished the ordinances made for the restraint
of the great; set at liberty those who were imprisoned; recalled the
Bardi and the Frescobaldi from exile, and forbade everyone from carrying
arms about his person. In order the better to defend himself against
those within the city, he made friends of all he could around it, and
therefore conferred great benefits upon the Aretini and other subjects
of the Florentines. He made peace with the Pisans, although raised to
power in order that he might carry on war against them; ceased paying
interest to those merchants who, during the war against Lucca, had lent
money to the republic; increased the old taxes, levied new ones, and
took from the Signory all authority. His rectors were Baglione da
Perugia and Guglielmo da Scesi, who, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini,
were the persons with whom he consulted on public affairs. He imposed
burdensome taxes upon the citizens; his decisions between contending
parties were unjust; and that precision and humanity which he had at
first assumed, became cruelty and pride; so that many of the greatest
citizens and noblest people were, either by fines, death, or some new
invention, grievously oppressed. And in completing the same bad system,
both without the city and within, he appointed six rectors for the
country, who beat and plundered the inhabitants. He suspected the great,
although he had been benefited by them, and had restored many to their
country; for he felt assured that the generous minds of the nobility
would not allow them, from any motives, to submit contentedly to his
authority. He also began to confer benefits and advantages upon the
lowest orders, thinking that with their assistance, and the arms of
foreigners, he would be able to preserve the tyranny. The month of May,
during which feasts are held, being come, he caused many companies to
be formed of the plebeians and very lowest of the people, and to these,
dignified with splendid titles, he gave colors and money; and while
one party went in bacchanalian procession through the city, others were
stationed in different parts of it, to receive them as guests. As the
report of the duke's authority spread abroad, many of French origin came
to him, for all of whom he found offices and emoluments, as if they
had been the most trustworthy of men; so that in a short time Florence
became not only subject to French dominion, but adopted their dress
and manners; for men and women, without regard to propriety or sense
of shame, imitated them. But that which disgusted the people most
completely was the violence which, without any distinction of quality or
rank, he and his followers committed upon the women.

The people were filled with indignation, seeing the majesty of the state
overturned, its ordinances annihilated, its laws annulled, and every
decent regulation set at naught; for men unaccustomed to royal pomp
could not endure to see this man surrounded with his armed satellites on
foot and on horseback; and having now a closer view of their disgrace,
they were compelled to honor him whom they in the highest degree
hated. To this hatred, was added the terror occasioned by the continual
imposition of new taxes and frequent shedding of blood, with which he
impoverished and consumed the city.

The duke was not unaware of these impressions existing strongly in the
people's minds, nor was he without fear of the consequences; but still
pretended to think himself beloved; and when Matteo di Morozzo, either
to acquire his favor or to free himself from danger, gave information
that the family of the Medici and some others had entered into a
conspiracy against him he not only did not inquire into the matter, but
caused the informer to be put to a cruel death. This mode of proceeding
restrained those who were disposed to acquaint him of his danger and
gave additional courage to such as sought his ruin. Bertone Cini, having
ventured to speak against the taxes with which the people were loaded,
had his tongue cut out with such barbarous cruelty as to cause his
death. This shocking act increased the people's rage, and their hatred
of the duke; for those who were accustomed to discourse and to act upon
every occasion with the greatest boldness, could not endure to live with
their hands tied and forbidden to speak.

This oppression increased to such a degree, that not merely the
Florentines, who though unable to preserve their liberty cannot endure
slavery, but the most servile people on earth would have been roused to
attempt the recovery of freedom; and consequently many citizens of all
ranks resolved either to deliver themselves from this odious tyranny or
die in the attempt. Three distinct conspiracies were formed; one of the
great; another of the people, and the third of the working classes; each
of which, besides the general causes which operated upon the whole, were
excited by some other particular grievance. The great found themselves
deprived of all participation in the government; the people had lost the
power they possessed, and the artificers saw themselves deficient in the
usual remuneration of their labor.

Agnolo Acciajuoli was at this time archbishop of Florence, and by his
discourses had formerly greatly favored the duke, and procured him many
followers among the higher class of the people. But when he found him
lord of the city, and became acquainted with his tyrannical mode of
proceeding, it appeared to him that he had misled his countrymen; and to
correct the evil he had done, he saw no other course, but to attempt the
cure by the means which had caused it. He therefore became the leader
of the first and most powerful conspiracy, and was joined by the Bardi,
Rossi, Frescobaldi, Scali Altoviti, Magalotti, Strozzi, and Mancini. Of
the second, the principals were Manno and Corso Donati, and with them
the Pazzi, Cavicciulli, Cerchi, and Albizzi. Of the third the first
was Antonio Adimari, and with him the Medici, Bordini, Rucellai, and
Aldobrandini. It was the intention of these last, to slay him in the
house of the Albizzi, whither he was expected to go on St. John's day,
to see the horses run, but he not having gone, their design did not
succeed. They then resolved to attack him as he rode through the
city; but they found this would be very difficult; for he was always
accompanied with a considerable armed force, and never took the same
road twice together, so that they had no certainty of where to find him.
They had a design of slaying him in the council, although they knew that
if he were dead, they would be at the mercy of his followers.

While these matters were being considered by the conspirators, Antonio
Adimari, in expectation of getting assistance from them, disclosed
the affair to some Siennese, his friends, naming certain of the
conspirators, and assuring them that the whole city was ready to rise at
once. One of them communicated the matter to Francesco Brunelleschi,
not with a design to injure the plot, but in the hope that he would join
them. Francesco, either from personal fear, or private hatred of some
one, revealed the whole to the duke; whereupon, Pagolo del Mazecha and
Simon da Monterappoli were taken, who acquainted him with the number and
quality of the conspirators. This terrified him, and he was advised to
request their presence rather than to take them prisoners, for if they
fled, he might without disgrace, secure himself by banishment of the
rest. He therefore sent for Antonio Adimari, who, confiding in
his companions, appeared immediately, and was detained. Francesco
Brunelleschi and Uguccione Buondelmonti advised the duke to take as many
of the conspirators prisoners as he could, and put them to death;
but he, thinking his strength unequal to his foes, did not adopt this
course, but took another, which, had it succeeded, would have freed him
from his enemies and increased his power. It was the custom of the duke
to call the citizens together upon some occasions and advise with them.
He therefore having first sent to collect forces from without, made
a list of three hundred citizens, and gave it to his messengers, with
orders to assemble them under the pretense of public business; and
having drawn them together, it was his intention either to put them to
death or imprison them.

The capture of Antonio Adimari and the sending for forces, which could
not be kept secret, alarmed the citizens, and more particularly those
who were in the plot, so that the boldest of them refused to attend, and
as each had read the list, they sought each other, and resolved to rise
at once and die like men, with arms in their hands, rather than be
led like calves to the slaughter. In a very short time the chief
conspirators became known to each other, and resolved that the next day,
which was the 26th July, 1343, they would raise a disturbance in the Old
Market place, then arm themselves and call the people to freedom.

The next morning being come, at nine o'clock, according to agreement,
they took arms, and at the call of liberty assembled, each party in its
own district, under the ensigns and with the arms of the people,
which had been secretly provided by the conspirators. All the heads of
families, as well of the nobility as of the people, met together, and
swore to stand in each other's defense, and effect the death of the
duke; except some of the Buondelmonti and of the Cavalcanti, with those
four families of the people which had taken so conspicuous a part in
making him sovereign, and the butchers, with others, the lowest of the
plebeians, who met armed in the piazza in his favor.

The duke immediately fortified the place, and ordered those of his
people who were lodged in different parts of the city to mount upon
horseback and join those in the court; but, on their way thither, many
were attacked and slain. However, about three hundred horse assembled,
and the duke was in doubt whether he should come forth and meet
the enemy, or defend himself within. On the other hand, the Medici,
Cavicciulli, Rucellai, and other families who had been most injured by
him, fearful that if he came forth, many of those who had taken arms
against him would discover themselves his partisans, in order to deprive
him of the occasion of attacking them and increasing the number of
his friends, took the lead and assailed the palace. Upon this, those
families of the people who had declared for the duke, seeing themselves
boldly attacked, changed their minds, and all took part with the
citizens, except Uguccione Buondelmonti, who retired into the palace,
and Giannozzo Cavalcanti, who having withdrawn with some of his
followers to the new market, mounted upon a bench, and begged that those
who were going in arms to the piazza, would take the part of the duke.
In order to terrify them, he exaggerated the number of his people and
threatened all with death who should obstinately persevere in their
undertaking against their sovereign. But not finding any one either
to follow him, or to chastise his insolence, and seeing his labor
fruitless, he withdrew to his own house.

In the meantime, the contest in the piazza between the people and the
forces of the duke was very great; but although the place served them
for defense, they were overcome, some yielding to the enemy, and others,
quitting their horses, fled within the walls. While this was going on,
Corso and Amerigo Donati, with a part of the people, broke open the
stinche, or prisons; burnt the papers of the provost and of the public
chamber; pillaged the houses of the rectors, and slew all who had held
offices under the duke whom they could find. The duke, finding the
piazza in possession of his enemies, the city opposed to him, and
without any hope of assistance, endeavored by an act of clemency to
recover the favor of the people. Having caused those whom he had made
prisoners to be brought before him, with amiable and kindly expressions
he set them at liberty, and made Antonio Adimari a knight, although
quite against his will. He caused his own arms to be taken down, and
those of the people to be replaced over the palace; but these things
coming out of season, and forced by his necessities, did him little
good. He remained, notwithstanding all he did, besieged in the palace,
and saw that having aimed at too much he had lost all, and would most
likely, after a few days, die either of hunger, or by the weapons of his
enemies. The citizens assembled in the church of Santa Reparata, to
form the new government, and appointed fourteen citizens, half from
the nobility and half from the people, who, with the archbishop, were
invested with full authority to remodel the state of Florence. They also
elected six others to take upon them the duties of provost, till he who
should be finally chosen took office, the duties of which were usually
performed by a subject of some neighboring state.

Many had come to Florence in defense of the people; among whom were a
party from Sienna, with six ambassadors, men of high consideration in
their own country. These endeavored to bring the people and the duke
to terms; but the former refused to listen to any whatever, unless
Guglielmo da Scesi and his son, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini, were
first given up to them. The duke would not consent to this; but being
threatened by those who were shut up with him, he was forced to comply.
The rage of men is certainly always found greater, and their revenge
more furious upon the recovery of liberty, than when it has only been
defended. Guglielmo and his son were placed among the thousands of their
enemies, and the latter was not yet eighteen years old; neither his
beauty, his innocence, nor his youth, could save him from the fury of
the multitude; but both were instantly slain. Those who could not wound
them while alive, wounded them after they were dead; and not satisfied
with tearing them to pieces, they hewed their bodies with swords, tore
them with their hands, and even with their teeth. And that every sense
might be satiated with vengeance, having first heard their moans, seen
their wounds, and touched their lacerated bodies, they wished even the
stomach to be satisfied, that having glutted the external senses, the
one within might also have its share. This rabid fury, however hurtful
to the father and son, was favorable to Cerrettieri; for the multitude,
wearied with their cruelty toward the former, quite forgot him, so that
he, not being asked for, remained in the palace, and during night was
conveyed safely away by his friends.

The rage of the multitude being appeased by their blood, an agreement
was made that the duke and his people, with whatever belonged to him,
should quit the city in safety; that he should renounce all claim, of
whatever kind, upon Florence, and that upon his arrival in the Casentino
he should ratify his renunciation. On the sixth of August he set out,
accompanied by many citizens, and having arrived at the Casentino he
ratified the agreement, although unwillingly, and would not have kept
his word if Count Simon had not threatened to take him back to Florence.
This duke, as his proceedings testified, was cruel and avaricious,
difficult to speak with, and haughty in reply. He desired the service of
men, not the cultivation of their better feelings, and strove rather
to inspire them with fear than love. Nor was his person less despicable
than his manners; he was short, his complexion was black, and he had a
long, thin beard. He was thus in every respect contemptible; and at the
end of ten months, his misconduct deprived him of the sovereignty which
the evil counsel of others had given him.



CHAPTER IX

Many cities and territories, subject to the Florentines, rebel--Prudent
conduct adopted upon this occasion--The city is divided into
quarters--Disputes between the nobility and the people--The bishop
endeavors to reconcile them, but does not succeed--The government
reformed by the people--Riot of Andrea Strozzi--Serious disagreements
between the nobility and the people--They come to arms, and the nobility
are subdued--The plague in Florence of which Boccaccio speaks.

These events taking place in the city, induced all the dependencies
of the Florentine state to throw off their yoke; so that Arezzo,
Castiglione, Pistoia, Volterra, Colle, and San Gemigniano rebelled. Thus
Florence found herself deprived of both her tyrant and her dominions at
the same moment, and in recovering her liberty, taught her subjects
how they might become free. The duke being expelled and the territories
lost, the fourteen citizens and the bishop thought it would be better to
act kindly toward their subjects in peace, than to make them enemies by
war, and to show a desire that their subjects should be free as well as
themselves. They therefore sent ambassadors to the people of Arezzo, to
renounce all dominion over that city, and to enter into a treaty with
them; to the end that as they could not retain them as subjects, they
might make use of them as friends. They also, in the best manner they
were able, agreed with the other places that they should retain their
freedom, and that, being free, they might mutually assist each other in
the preservation of their liberties. This prudent course was attended
with a most favorable result; for Arezzo, not many years afterward,
returned to the Florentine rule, and the other places, in the course
of a few months, returned to their former obedience. Thus it frequently
occurs that we sooner attain our ends by a seeming indifferent to them,
than by more obstinate pursuit.

Having settled external affairs, they now turned to the consideration of
those within the city; and after some altercation between the nobility
and the people, it was arranged that the nobility should form one-third
of the Signory and fill one-half of the other offices. The city was, as
we have before shown, divided into sixths; and hence there would be six
signors, one for each sixth, except when, from some more than ordinary
cause, there had been twelve or thirteen created; but when this had
occurred they were again soon reduced to six. It now seemed desirable to
make an alteration in this respect, as well because the sixths were
not properly divided, as that, wishing to give their proportion to
the great, it became desirable to increase the number. They therefore
divided the city into quarters, and for each created three signors.
They abolished the office of Gonfalonier of Justice, and also the
Gonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and instead of the twelve
Buonuomini, or good men, created eight counsellors, four from each
party. The government having been established in this manner, the city
might have been in repose if the great had been content to live in that
moderation which civil society requires. But they produced a contrary
result, for those out of office would not conduct themselves as
citizens, and those who were in government wished to be lords, so that
every day furnished some new instance of their insolence and pride.
These things were very grievous to the people, and they began to regret
that for one tyrant put down, there had sprung up a thousand. The
arrogance of one party and the anger of the other rose to such a degree,
that the heads of the people complained to the bishop of the improper
conduct of the nobility, and what unfit associates they had become for
the people; and begged he would endeavor to induce them to be content
with their share of administration in the other offices, and leave the
magistracy of the Signory wholly to themselves.

The bishop was naturally a well-meaning man, but his want of firmness
rendered him easily influenced. Hence, at the instance of his
associates, he at first favored the duke of Athens, and afterward, by
the advice of other citizens, conspired against him. At the reformation
of the government, he had favored the nobility, and now he appeared to
incline toward the people, moved by the reasons which they had
advanced. Thinking to find in others the same instability of purpose, he
endeavored to effect an amicable arrangement. With this design he called
together the fourteen who were yet in office, and in the best terms
he could imagine advised them to give up the Signory to the people, in
order to secure the peace of the city; and assured them that if they
refused, ruin would most probably be the result.

This discourse excited the anger of the nobility to the highest pitch,
and Ridolfo de' Bardi reproved him in unmeasured terms as a man of
little faith; reminding him of his friendship for the duke, to prove the
duplicity of his present conduct, and saying, that in driving him away
he had acted the part of a traitor. He concluded by telling him, that
the honors they had acquired at their own peril, they would at their own
peril defend. They then left the bishop, and in great wrath, informed
their associates in the government, and all the families of the
nobility, of what had been done. The people also expressed their
thoughts to each other, and as the nobility made preparations for the
defense of their signors, they determined not to wait till they had
perfected their arrangements; and therefore, being armed, hastened to
the palace, shouting, as they went along, that the nobility must give up
their share in the government.

The uproar and excitement were astonishing. The Signors of the nobility
found themselves abandoned; for their friends, seeing all the people in
arms, did not dare to rise in their defense, but each kept within his
own house. The Signors of the people endeavored to abate the excitement
of the multitude, by affirming their associates to be good and moderate
men; but, not succeeding in their attempt, to avoid a greater evil, sent
them home to their houses, whither they were with difficulty conducted.
The nobility having left the palace, the office of the four councillors
was taken from their party, and conferred upon twelve of the people. To
the eight signors who remained, a Gonfalonier of Justice was added, and
sixteen Gonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and the council
was so reformed, that the government remained wholly in the hands of the
popular party.

At the time these events took place there was a great scarcity in the
city, and discontent prevailed both among the highest and the lowest
classes; in the latter for want of food, and in the former from having
lost their power in the state. This circumstance induced Andrea Strozzi
to think of making himself sovereign of the city. Selling his corn at a
lower price than others did, a great many people flocked to his house;
emboldened by the sight of these, he one morning mounted his horse, and,
followed by a considerable number, called the people to arms, and in a
short time drew together about 4,000 men, with whom he proceeded to the
Signory, and demanded that the gates of the palace should be opened. But
the signors, by threats and the force which they retained in the palace,
drove them from the court; and then by proclamation so terrified them,
that they gradually dropped off and returned to their homes, and Andrea,
finding himself alone, with some difficulty escaped falling into the
hands of the magistrates.

This event, although an act of great temerity, and attended with the
result that usually follows such attempts, raised a hope in the minds
of the nobility of overcoming the people, seeing that the lowest of the
plebeians were at enmity with them. And to profit by this circumstance,
they resolved to arm themselves, and with justifiable force recover
those rights of which they had been unjustly deprived. Their minds
acquired such an assurance of success, that they openly provided
themselves with arms, fortified their houses, and even sent to their
friends in Lombardy for assistance. The people and the Signory made
preparation for their defense, and requested aid from Perugia and
Sienna, so that the city was filled with the armed followers of either
party. The nobility on this side of the Arno divided themselves into
three parts; the one occupied the houses of the Cavicciulli, near the
church of St. John; another, the houses of the Pazzi and the Donati,
near the great church of St. Peter; and the third those of the
Cavalcanti in the New Market. Those beyond the river fortified the
bridges and the streets in which their houses stood; the Nerli defended
the bridge of the Carraja; the Frescobaldi and the Manelli, the church
of the Holy Trinity; and the Rossi and the Bardi, the bridge of the
Rubaconte and the Old Bridge. The people were drawn together under the
Gonfalon of justice and the ensigns of the companies of the artisans.

Both sides being thus arranged in order of battle, the people thought
it imprudent to defer the contest, and the attack was commenced by
the Medici and the Rondinelli, who assailed the Cavicciulli, where the
houses of the latter open upon the piazza of St. John. Here both parties
contended with great obstinacy, and were mutually wounded, from the
towers by stones and other missiles, and from below by arrows. They
fought for three hours; but the forces of the people continuing to
increase, and the Cavicciulli finding themselves overcome by numbers,
and hopeless of other assistance, submitted themselves to the people,
who saved their houses and property; and having disarmed them, ordered
them to disperse among their relatives and friends, and remain unarmed.
Being victorious in the first attack, they easily overpowered the Pazzi
and the Donati, whose numbers were less than those they had subdued; so
that there only remained on this side of the Arno, the Cavalcanti, who
were strong both in respect of the post they had chosen and in their
followers. Nevertheless, seeing all the Gonfalons against them, and
that the others had been overcome by three Gonfalons alone, they yielded
without offering much resistance. Three parts of the city were now in
the hands of the people, and only one in possession of the nobility; but
this was the strongest, as well on account of those who held it, as from
its situation, being defended by the Arno; hence it was first necessary
to force the bridges. The Old Bridge was first assailed and offered a
brave resistance; for the towers were armed, the streets barricaded,
and the barricades defended by the most resolute men; so that the
people were repulsed with great loss. Finding their labor at this point
fruitless, they endeavored to force the Rubaconte Bridge, but no
better success resulting, they left four Gonfalons in charge of the two
bridges, and with the others attacked the bridge of the Carraja. Here,
although the Nerli defended themselves like brave men, they could not
resist the fury of the people; for this bridge, having no towers,
was weaker than the others, and was attacked by the Capponi, and many
families of the people who lived in that vicinity. Being thus assailed
on all sides, they abandoned the barricades and gave way to the people,
who then overcame the Rossi and the Frescobaldi; for all those beyond
the Arno took part with the conquerors.

There was now no resistance made except by the Bardi, who remained
undaunted, notwithstanding the failure of their friends, the union of
the people against them, and the little chance of success which they
seemed to have. They resolved to die fighting, and rather see their
houses burned and plundered, than submit to the power of their enemies.
They defended themselves with such obstinacy, that many fruitless
attempts were made to overcome them, both at the Old Bridge and the
Rubaconte; but their foes were always repulsed with loss. There had in
former times been a street which led between the houses of the Pitti,
from the Roman road to the walls upon Mount St. George. By this way
the people sent six Gonfalons, with orders to assail their houses from
behind. This attack overcame the resolution of the Bardi, and decided
the day in favor of the people; for when those who defended the
barricades in the street learned that their houses were being plundered,
they left the principal fight and hastened to their defense. This caused
the Old Bridge to be lost; the Bardi fled in all directions and were
received into the houses of the Quaratesi, Panzanesi, and Mozzi. The
people, especially the lower classes, greedy for spoil, sacked and
destroyed their houses, and pulled down and burned their towers and
palaces with such outrageous fury, that the most cruel enemy of the
Florentine name would have been ashamed of taking part in such wanton
destruction.

The nobility being thus overcome, the people reformed the government;
and as they were of three kinds, the higher, the middle, and the lower
class, it was ordered that the first should appoint two signors; the two
latter three each, and that the Gonfalonier should be chosen alternately
from either party. Besides this, all the regulations for the restraint
of the nobility were renewed; and in order to weaken them still more,
many were reduced to the grade of the people. The ruin of the nobility
was so complete, and depressed them so much, that they never afterward
ventured to take arms for the recovery of their power, but soon became
humbled and abject in the extreme. And thus Florence lost the generosity
of her character and her distinction in arms.

After these events the city remained in peace till the year 1353. In the
course of this period occurred the memorable plague, described with so
much eloquence by Giovanni Boccaccio, and by which Florence lost 96,000
souls. In 1348, began the first war with the Visconti, occasioned by
the archbishop, then prince of Milan; and when this was concluded,
dissensions again arose in the city; for although the nobility were
destroyed, fortune did not fail to cause new divisions and new troubles.

CHAPTER I

Reflections upon the domestic discords of republics--A parallel between
the discords of Rome and those of Florence--Enmities between the
families of the Ricci and the Albizzi--Uguccione de' Ricci causes
the laws against the Ghibellines to be renewed in order to injure
the Albizzi--Piero degli Albizzi derives advantage from it--Origin of
admonitions and the troubles which result from them--Uguccione de'
Ricci moderates their injustice--Difficulties increase--A meeting of the
citizens--They address the Signory--The Signory attempt to remedy the
evils.

Those serious, though natural enmities, which occur between the popular
classes and the nobility, arising from the desire of the latter to
command, and the disinclination of the former to obey, are the causes of
most of the troubles which take place in cities; and from this diversity
of purpose, all the other evils which disturb republics derive their
origin. This kept Rome disunited; and this, if it be allowable to
compare small things with great, held Florence in disunion; although
in each city it produced a different result; for animosities were only
beginning with the people and nobility of Rome contended, while ours
were brought to a conclusion by the contentions of our citizens. A new
law settled the disputes of Rome; those of Florence were only terminated
by the death and banishment of many of her best people. Those of
Rome increased her military virtue, while that of Florence was quite
extinguished by her divisions. The quarrels of Rome established
different ranks of society, those of Florence abolished the distinctions
which had previously existed. This diversity of effects must have been
occasioned by the different purposes which the two people had in view.
While the people of Rome endeavored to associate with the nobility in
the supreme honors, those of Florence strove to exclude the nobility
from all participation in them: as the desire of the Roman people was
more reasonable, no particular offense was given to the nobility; they
therefore consented to it without having recourse to arms; so that,
after some disputes concerning particular points, both parties agreed to
the enactment of a law which, while it satisfied the people, preserved
the nobility in the enjoyment of their dignity.

On the other hand, the demands of the people of Florence being insolent
and unjust, the nobility, became desperate, prepared for their defense
with their utmost energy, and thus bloodshed and the exile of citizens
followed. The laws which were afterward made, did not provide for the
common good, but were framed wholly in favor of the conquerors. This
too, must be observed, that from the acquisition of power, made by the
people of Rome, their minds were very much improved; for all the offices
of state being attainable as well by the people as the nobility,
the peculiar excellencies of the latter exercised a most beneficial
influence upon the former; and as the city increased in virtue she
attained a more exalted greatness.

But in Florence, the people being conquerors, the nobility were deprived
of all participation in the government; and in order to regain a portion
of it, it became necessary for them not only to seem like the people,
but to be like them in behavior, mind, and mode of living. Hence arose
those changes in armorial bearings, and in the titles of families, which
the nobility adopted, in order that they might seem to be of the people;
military virtue and generosity of feeling became extinguished in them;
the people not possessing these qualities, they could not appreciate
them, and Florence became by degrees more and more depressed and
humiliated. The virtue of the Roman nobility degenerating into pride,
the citizens soon found that the business of the state could not be
carried on without a prince. Florence had now come to such a point, that
with a comprehensive mind at the head of affairs she would easily have
been made to take any form that he might have been disposed to give her;
as may be partly observed by a perusal of the preceding book.

Having given an account of the origin of Florence, the commencement
of her liberty, with the causes of her divisions, and shown how the
factions of the nobility and the people ceased with the tyranny of the
duke of Athens, and the ruin of the former, we have now to speak of
the animosities between the citizens and the plebeians and the various
circumstances which they produced.

The nobility being overcome, and the war with the archbishop of Milan
concluded, there did not appear any cause of dissension in Florence. But
the evil fortune of the city, and the defective nature of her laws,
gave rise to enmities between the family of the Albizzi and that of
the Ricci, which divided her citizens as completely as those of the
Buondelmonti and the Uberti, or the Donati and the Cerchi had formerly
done. The pontiffs, who at this time resided in France, and the
emperors, who abode in Germany, in order to maintain their influence
in Italy, sent among us multitudes of soldiers of many countries, as
English, Dutch, and Bretons. As these, upon the conclusion of a war,
were thrown out of pay, though still in the country, they, under the
standard of some soldier of fortune, plundered such people as were least
prepared to defend themselves. In the year 1353 one of these companies
came into Tuscany under the command of Monsignor Reale, of Provence, and
his approach terrified all the cities of Italy. The Florentines not
only provided themselves forces, but many citizens, among whom were
the Albizzi and the Ricci, armed themselves in their own defense. These
families were at the time full of hatred against each other, and each
thought to obtain the sovereignty of the republic by overcoming his
enemy. They had not yet proceeded to open violence, but only contended
in the magistracies and councils. The city being all in arms, a quarrel
arose in the Old Market place, and, as it frequently happens in similar
cases, a great number of people were drawn together. The disturbance
spreading, it was told the Ricci that the Albizzi had assailed their
partisans, and to the Albizzi that the Ricci were in quest of them. Upon
this the whole city arose, and it was all the magistrates could do to
restrain these families, and prevent the actual occurrence of a disaster
which, without being the fault of either of them, had been willfully
though falsely reported as having already taken place. This apparently
trifling circumstance served to inflame the minds of the parties, and
make each the more resolved to increase the number of their followers.
And as the citizens, since the ruin of the nobility, were on such an
equality that the magistrates were more respected now than they had
previously been, they designed to proceed toward the suppression of this
disorder with civil authority alone.

We have before related, that after the victory of Charles I. the
government was formed of the Guelphic party, and that it thus
acquired great authority over the Ghibellines. But time, a variety of
circumstances, and new divisions had so contributed to sink this party
feeling into oblivion, that many of Ghibelline descent now filled the
highest offices. Observing this, Uguccione, the head of the family of
the Ricci, contrived that the law against the Ghibellines should be
again brought into operation; many imagining the Albizzi to be of that
faction, they having arisen in Arezzo, and come long ago to Florence.
Uguccione by this means hoped to deprive the Albizzi of participation
in the government, for all of Ghibelline blood who were found to hold
offices, would be condemned in the penalties which this law provided.
The design of Uguccione was discovered to Piero son of Filippo degli
Albizzi, and he resolved to favor it: for he saw that to oppose it would
at once declare him a Ghibelline; and thus the law which was renewed by
the ambition of the Ricci for his destruction, instead of robbing Piero
degli Albizzi of reputation, contributed to increase his influence,
although it laid the foundation of many evils. Nor is it possible for
a republic to enact a law more pernicious than one relating to matters
which have long transpired. Piero having favored this law, which had
been contrived by his enemies for his stumbling-block, it became the
stepping-stone to his greatness; for, making himself the leader of this
new order of things, his authority went on increasing, and he was in
greater favor with the Guelphs than any other man.

As there could not be found a magistrate willing to search out who were
Ghibellines, and as this renewed enactment against them was therefore
of small value, it was provided that authority should be given to the
Capitani to find out who were of this faction; and, having discovered,
to signify and ADMONISH them that they were not to take upon
themselves any office of government; to which ADMONITIONS, if they were
disobedient, they became condemned in the penalties. Hence, all those
who in Florence are deprived of the power to hold offices are called
_ammoniti_, or ADMONISHED.

The Capitani in time acquiring greater audacity, admonished not only
those to whom the admonition was applicable, but any others at the
suggestion of their own avarice or ambition; and from 1356, when this
law was made, to 1366, there had been admonished above 200 citizens.
The Captains of the Parts and the sect of the Guelphs were thus become
powerful; for every one honored them for fear of being admonished; and
most particularly the leaders, who were Piero degli Albizzi, Lapo da
Castiglionchio, and Carlo Strozzi. This insolent mode of proceeding was
offensive to many; but none felt so particularly injured with it as
the Ricci; for they knew themselves to have occasioned it, they saw
it involved the ruin of the republic, and their enemies, the Albizzi,
contrary to their intention, became great in consequence.

On this account Uguccione de' Ricci, being one of the Signory, resolved
to put an end to the evil which he and his friends had originated, and
with a new law provided that to the six Captains of Parts an additional
three should be appointed, of whom two should be chosen from the
companies of minor artificers, and that before any party could be
declared Ghibelline, the declaration of the Capitani must be confirmed
by twenty-four Guelphic citizens, appointed for the purpose. This
provision tempered for a time the power of the Capitani, so that the
admonitions were greatly diminished, if not wholly laid aside. Still the
parties of the Albizzi and the Ricci were continually on the alert to
oppose each other's laws, deliberations, and enterprises, not from a
conviction of their inexpediency, but from a hatred of their promoters.

In such distractions the time passed from 1366 to 1371, when the
Guelphs again regained the ascendant. There was in the family of the
Buondelmonti a gentleman named Benchi, who, as an acknowledgment of his
merit in a war against the Pisans, though one of the nobility, had been
admitted among the people, and thus became eligible to office among the
Signory; but when about to take his seat with them, a law was made that
no nobleman who had become of the popular class should be allowed to
assume that office. This gave great offense to Benchi, who, in union
with Piero degli Albizzi, determined to depress the less powerful of
the popular party with ADMONITIONS, and obtain the government for
themselves. By the interest which Benchi possessed with the ancient
nobility, and that of Piero with most of the influential citizens, the
Guelphic party resumed their ascendancy, and by new reforms among the
PARTS, so remodeled the administration as to be able to dispose of the
offices of the captains and the twenty-four citizens at pleasure. They
then returned to the ADMONITIONS with greater audacity than ever, and
the house of the Albizzi became powerful as the head of this faction.

On the other hand, the Ricci made the most strenuous exertions against
their designs; so that anxiety universally prevailed, and ruin was
apprehended alike from both parties. In consequence of this a great
number of citizens, out of love to their country, assembled in the
church of St. Piero Scarraggio, and after a long consideration of the
existing disorders, presented themselves before the Signors, whom one of
the principal among them addressed in the following terms:--

"Many of us, magnificent Signors! were afraid of meeting even for
consideration of public business, without being publicly called
together, lest we should be noted as presumptuous or condemned as
ambitious. But seeing that so many citizens daily assemble in the lodges
and halls of the palace, not for any public utility, but only for the
gratification of their own ambition, we have thought that as those who
assemble for the ruin of the republic are fearless, so still less ought
they to be apprehensive who meet together only for its advantage; nor
ought we to be anxious respecting the opinion they may form of our
assembling, since they are so utterly indifferent to the opinion of
others. Our affection for our country, magnificent Signors! caused us
to assemble first, and now brings us before you, to speak of grievances
already great and daily increasing in our republic, and to offer our
assistance for their removal: and we doubt not that, though a difficult
undertaking, it will still be attended with success, if you will lay
aside all private regards, and authoritatively use the public force.

"The common corruption of all the cities of Italy, magnificent Signors!
has infested and still vitiates your own; for when this province had
shaken off the imperial yoke, her cities not being subject to any
powerful influence that might restrain them, administered affairs, not
as free men do, but as a factious populace; and hence have arisen all
the other evils and disorders that have appeared. In the first place,
there cannot be found among the citizens either unity or friendship,
except with those whose common guilt, either against their country or
against private individuals, is a bond of union. And as the knowledge
of religion and the fear of God seem to be alike extinct, oaths and
promises have lost their validity, and are kept as long as it is found
expedient; they are adopted only as a means of deception, and he is most
applauded and respected whose cunning is most efficient and secure. On
this account bad men are received with the approbation due to virtue,
and good ones are regarded only in the light of fools.

"And certainly in the cities of Italy all that is corruptible and
corrupting is assembled. The young are idle, the old lascivious, and
each sex and every age abounds with debasing habits, which the good
laws, by misapplication, have lost the power to correct. Hence arises
the avarice so observable among the citizens, and that greediness,
not for true glory, but for unworthy honors; from which follow hatred,
animosities, quarrels, and factions; resulting in deaths, banishments,
affliction to all good men, and the advancement of the most
unprincipled; for the good, confiding in their innocence, seek neither
safety nor advancement by illegal methods as the wicked do, and thus
unhonored and undefended they sink into oblivion.

"From proceedings such as these, arise at once the attachment for and
influence of parties; bad men follow them through ambition and avarice,
and necessity compels the good to pursue the same course. And most
lamentable is it to observe how the leaders and movers of parties
sanctify their base designs with words that are all piety and virtue;
they have the name of liberty constantly in their mouths, though their
actions prove them her greatest enemies. The reward which they desire
from victory is not the glory of having given liberty to the city, but
the satisfaction of having vanquished others, and of making themselves
rulers; and to attain their end, there is nothing too unjust, too cruel,
too avaricious for them to attempt. Thus laws and ordinances, peace,
wars, and treaties are adopted and pursued, not for the public good, not
for the common glory of the state, but for the convenience or advantage
of a few individuals.

"And if other cities abound in these disorders, ours is more than any
infected with them; for her laws, statutes, and civil ordinances are
not, nor have they ever been, established for the benefit of men in a
state of freedom, but according to the wish of the faction that has
been uppermost at the time. Hence it follows that, when one party is
expelled, or faction extinguished, another immediately arises; for, in
a city that is governed by parties rather than by laws, as soon as one
becomes dominant and unopposed, it must of necessity soon divide against
itself; for the private methods at first adapted for its defense will
now no longer keep it united. The truth of this, both the ancient and
modern dissensions of our city prove. Everyone thought that when the
Ghibellines were destroyed, the Guelphs would long continue happy and
honored; yet after a short time they divided into the Bianchi and Neri,
the black faction and the white. When the Bianchi were overcome, the
city was not long free from factions; for either, in favor of the
emigrants, or on account of the animosity between the nobility and the
people, we were still constantly at war. And as if resolved to give up
to others, what in mutual harmony we either would not or were unable
to retain, we confided the care of our precious liberty first to King
Robert, then to his brother, next to his son, and at last to the duke of
Athens. Still we have never in any condition found repose, but seem
like men who can neither agree to live in freedom nor be content
with slavery. Nor did we hesitate (so greatly does the nature of our
ordinances dispose us to division), while yet under allegiance to the
king, to substitute for his majesty, one of the vilest of men born at
Agobbio.

"For the credit of the city, the name of the duke of Athens ought to be
consigned to oblivion. His cruel and tyrannical disposition, however,
might have taught us wisdom and instructed us how to live; but no sooner
was he expelled than we handled our arms, and fought with more hatred,
and greater fury than we had ever done on any former occasion; so that
the ancient nobility were vanquished the city was left at the disposal
of the people. It was generally supposed that no further occasion of
quarrel or of party animosity could arise, since those whose pride and
insupportable ambition had been regarded as the causes of them were
depressed; however, experience proves how liable human judgment is to
error, and what false impressions men imbibe, even in regard to the
things that most intimately concern them; for we find the pride and
ambition of the nobility are not extinct, but only transferred from them
to the people who at this moment, according to the usual practice of
ambitious men, are endeavoring to render themselves masters of the
republic; and knowing they have no chance of success but what is offered
by discord, they have again divided the city, and the names of Guelph
and Ghibelline, which were beginning to be forgotten (and it would have
been well if they had never been heard among us), are repeated anew in
our ears.

"It seems almost necessarily ordained, in order that in human affairs
there may be nothing either settled or permanent, that in all republics
there are what may be called fatal families, born for the ruin of their
country. Of this kind of pest our city has produced a more copious brood
than any other; for not one but many have disturbed and harassed her:
first the Buondelmonti and the Uberti; then the Donati and the Cerchi;
and now, oh ridiculous! oh disgraceful thought! the Ricci and the
Albizzi have caused a division of her citizens.

"We have not dwelt upon our corrupt habits or our old and continual
dissensions to occasion you alarm, but to remind you of their causes; to
show that as you doubtless are aware of them, we also keep them in view,
and to remind you that their results ought not to make you diffident
of your power to repress the disorders of the present time. The ancient
families possessed so much influence, and were held in such high esteem,
that civil force was insufficient to restrain them; but now, when the
empire has lost its ascendancy, the pope is no longer formidable, and
the whole of Italy is reduced to a state of the most complete equality,
there can be no difficulty. Our republic might more especially than any
other (although at first our former practices seem to present a reason
to the contrary), not only keep itself united but be improved by good
laws and civil regulations, if you, the Signory, would once resolve to
undertake the matter; and to this we, induced by no other motive than
the love of our country, would most strongly urge you. It is true
the corruption of the country is great, and much discretion will be
requisite to correct it; but do not impute the past disorders to
the nature of the men, but to the times, which, being changed, give
reasonable ground to hope that, with better government, our city will
be attended with better fortune; for the malignity of the people will
be overcome by restraining the ambition and annulling the ordinances of
those who have encouraged faction, and adopting in their stead only such
principles as are conformable to true civil liberty. And be assured,
that these desirable ends will be more certainly attained by the benign
influence of the laws, than by a delay which will compel the people to
effect them by force and arms."

The Signory, induced by the necessity of the case, of which they were
previously aware, and further encouraged by the advice of those who now
addressed them, gave authority to fifty-six citizens to provide for the
safety of the republic. It is usually found that most men are better
adapted to pursue a good course already begun, than to discover one
applicable to immediate circumstances. These citizens thought rather of
extinguishing existing factions than of preventing the formation of
new ones, and effected neither of these objects. The facilities for the
establishment of new parties were not removed; and out of those which
they guarded against, another more powerful arose, which brought the
republic into still greater danger. They, however, deprived three of
the family of the Albizzi, and three of that of the Ricci, of all the
offices of government, except those of the Guelphic party, for three
years; and among the deprived were Piero degli Albizzi and Uguccione
de' Ricci. They forbade the citizens to assemble in the palace, except
during the sittings of the Signory. They provided that if any one were
beaten, or possession of his property detained from him, he might bring
his case before the council and denounce the offender, even if he were
one of the nobility; and that if it were proved, the accused should be
subject to the usual penalties. This provision abated the boldness of
the Ricci, and increased that of the Albizzi; since, although it applied
equally to both, the Ricci suffered from it by far the most; for if
Piero was excluded from the palace of the Signory, the chamber of the
Guelphs, in which he possessed the greatest authority, remained open to
him; and if he and his followers had previously been ready to ADMONISH,
they became after this injury, doubly so. To this pre-disposition for
evil, new excitements were added.



CHAPTER II

The war of the Florentines against the pope's legate, and the causes
of it--League against the pope--The censures of the pope disregarded in
Florence--The city is divided into two factions, the one the Capitani di
Parte, the other of the eight commissioners of the war--Measures adopted
by the Guelphic party against their adversaries--The Guelphs endeavor to

Medici Gonfalonier--His law against the nobility, and in favor of the
Ammoniti--The _Collegi_ disapprove of the law--Salvestro addresses the
council in its favor--The law is passed--Disturbances in Florence.

The papal chair was occupied by Gregory XI. He, like his predecessors,
residing at Avignon, governed Italy by legates, who, proud and
avaricious, oppressed many of the cities. One of these legates, then
at Bologna, taking advantage of a great scarcity of food at Florence,
endeavored to render himself master of Tuscany, and not only withheld
provisions from the Florentines, but in order to frustrate their hopes
of the future harvest, upon the approach of spring, attacked them with
a large army, trusting that being famished and unarmed, he should find
them an easy conquest. He might perhaps have been successful, had not
his forces been mercenary and faithless, and, therefore, induced
to abandon the enterprise for the sum of 130,000 florins, which the
Florentines paid them. People may go to war when they will, but cannot
always withdraw when they like. This contest, commenced by the ambition
of the legate, was sustained by the resentment of the Florentines,
who, entering into a league with Bernabo of Milan, and with the cities
hostile to the church, appointed eight citizens for the administration
of it, giving them authority to act without appeal, and to expend
whatever sums they might judge expedient, without rendering an account
of the outlay.

This war against the pontiff, although Uguccione was now dead,
reanimated those who had followed the party of the Ricci, who, in
opposition to the Albizzi, had always favored Bernabo and opposed the
church, and this, the rather, because the eight commissioners of war
were all enemies of the Guelphs. This occasioned Piero degli Albizzi,
Lapo da Castiglionchio, Carlo Strozzi, and others, to unite themselves
more closely in opposition to their adversaries. The eight carried on
the war, and the others admonished during three years, when the death
of the pontiff put an end to the hostilities, which had been carried on
which so much ability, and with such entire satisfaction to the people,
that at the end of each year the eight were continued in office, and
were called _Santi_, or holy, although they had set ecclesiastical
censures at defiance, plundered the churches of their property, and
compelled the priests to perform divine service. So much did citizens
at that time prefer the good of their country to their ghostly
consolations, and thus showed the church, that if as her friends they
had defended, they could as enemies depress her; for the whole of
Romagna, the Marches, and Perugia were excited to rebellion.

Yet while this war was carried on against the pope, they were unable to
defend themselves against the captains of the parts and their faction;
for the insolence of the Guelphs against the eight attained such a
pitch, that they could not restrain themselves from abusive behavior,
not merely against some of the most distinguished citizens, but even
against the eight themselves; and the captains of the parts conducted
themselves with such arrogance, that they were feared more than the
Signory. Those who had business with them treated them with greater
reverence, and their court was held in higher estimation: so that no
ambassador came to Florence, without commission to the captains.

Pope Gregory being dead, and the city freed from external war; there
still prevailed great confusion within; for the audacity of the Guelphs
was insupportable, and as no available mode of subduing them presented
itself, it was thought that recourse must be had to arms, to determine
which party was the strongest. With the Guelphs were all the ancient
nobility, and the greater part of the most popular leaders, of which
number, as already remarked, were Lapo, Piero, and Carlo. On the other
side, were all the lower orders, the leaders of whom were the eight
commissioners of war, Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and with them
the Ricci, Alberti, and Medici. The rest of the multitude, as most
commonly happens, joined the discontented party.

It appeared to the heads of the Guelphic faction that their enemies
would be greatly strengthened, and themselves in considerable danger in
case a hostile Signory should resolve on their subjugation. Desirous,
therefore, of being prepared against this calamity, the leaders of the
party assembled to take into consideration the state of the city and
that of their own friends in particular, and found the _ammoniti_ so
numerous and so great a difficulty, that the whole city was excited
against them on this account. They could not devise any other remedy
than, that as their enemies had deprived them of all the offices of
honor, they should banish their opponents from the city, take possession
of the palace of the Signory, and bring over the whole state to their
own party; in imitation of the Guelphs of former times, who found no
safety in the city, till they had driven all their adversaries out of
it. They were unanimous upon the main point, but did not agree upon the
time of carrying it into execution. It was in the month of April, in the
year 1378, when Lapo, thinking delay inadvisable, expressed his opinion,
that procrastination was in the highest degree perilous to themselves;
as in the next Signory, Salvestro de' Medici would very probably be
elected Gonfalonier, and they all knew he was opposed to their party.
Piero degli Albizzi, on the other hand, thought it better to defer,
since they would require forces, which could not be assembled without
exciting observation, and if they were discovered, they would incur
great risk. He thereupon judged it preferable to wait till the
approaching feast of St. John on which, being the most solemn festival
of the city, vast multitudes would be assembled, among whom they
might conceal whatever numbers they pleased. To obviate their fears of
Salvestro, he was to be ADMONISHED, and if this did not appear likely to
be effectual, they would "ADMONISH" one of the Colleague of his quarter,
and upon redrawing, as the ballot-boxes would be nearly empty, chance
would very likely occasion that either he or some associate of his
would be drawn, and he would thus be rendered incapable of sitting as
Gonfalonier. They therefore came to the conclusion proposed by Piero,
though Lapo consented reluctantly, considering the delay dangerous, and
that, as no opportunity can be in all respects suitable, he who waits
for the concurrence of every advantage, either never makes an attempt,
or, if induced to do so, is most frequently foiled. They "admonished"
the Colleague, but did not prevent the appointment of Salvestro, for the
design was discovered by the Eight, who took care to render all attempts
upon the drawing futile.

Salvestro Alammano de' Medici was therefore drawn Gonfalonier, and,
being one of the noblest popular families, he could not endure that the
people should be oppressed by a few powerful persons. Having resolved
to put an end to their insolence, and perceiving the middle classes
favorably disposed, and many of the highest of the people on his side,
he communicated his design to Benedetto Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi, and
Georgio Scali, who all promised their assistance. They, therefore,
secretly draw up a law which had for its object to revive the
restrictions upon the nobility, to retrench the authority of the
Capitani di Parte, and recall the _ammoniti_ to their dignity. In order
to attempt and obtain their ends, at one and the same time, having to
consult, first the Colleagues and then the Councils, Salvestro being
Provost (which office for the time makes its possessor almost prince of
the city), he called together the Colleagues and the Council on the same
morning, and the Colleagues being apart, he proposed the law prepared
by himself and his friends, which, being a novelty, encountered in their
small number so much opposition, that he was unable to have it passed.

Salvestro, seeing his first attempt likely to fail, pretended to leave
the room for a private reason, and, without being perceived, went
immediately to the Council, and taking a lofty position from which he
could be both seen and heard, said:--"That considering himself invested
with the office of Gonfalonier, not so much to preside in private
cases (for which proper judges were appointed, who have their regular
sittings), as to guard the state, correct the insolence of the powerful,
and ameliorate those laws by the influence of which the republic was
being ruined, he had carefully attended to both these duties, and to his
utmost ability provided for them, but found the perversity of some so
much opposed to his just designs as to deprive him of all opportunity of
doing good, and them not only of the means of assisting him with
their counsel, but even hearing him. Therefore finding he no longer
contributed either to the benefit of the republic or of the people
generally, he could not perceive any reason for his longer holding the
magistracy, of which he was either undeserving, or others thought him
so, and would therefore retire to his house, that the people might
appoint another in his stead, who would either have greater virtue or
better fortune than himself." And having said this, he left the room as
if to return home.

Those of the council who were in the secret, and others desirous of
novelty, raised a tumult, at which the Signory and the Colleagues came
together, and finding the Gonfalonier leaving them, entreatingly and
authoritatively detained him, and obliged him to return to the council
room, which was now full of confusion. Many of the noble citizens
were threatened in opprobrious language; and an artificer seized Carlo
Strozzi by the throat, and would undoubtedly have murdered him, but
was with difficulty prevented by those around. He who made the greatest
disturbance, and incited the city to violence, was Benedetto degli
Alberti, who, from a window of the palace, loudly called the people to
arms; and presently the courtyards were filled with armed men, and the
Colleagues granted to threats, what they had refused to entreaty. The
Capitani di Parte had at the same time drawn together a great number of
citizens to their hall to consult upon the means of defending themselves
against the orders of the Signors, but when they heard the tumult that
was raised, and were informed of the course the Councils had adopted,
each took refuge in his own house.

Let no one, when raising popular commotions, imagine he can afterward
control them at his pleasure, or restrain them from proceeding to the
commission of violence. Salvestro intended to enact his law, and compose
the city; but it happened otherwise; for the feelings of all had
become so excited, that they shut up the shops; the citizens fortified
themselves in their houses; many conveyed their valuable property into
the churches and monasteries, and everyone seemed to apprehend something
terrible at hand. The companies of the Arts met, and each appointed
an additional officer or Syndic; upon which the Priors summoned their
Colleagues and these Syndics, and consulted a whole day how the city
might be appeased with satisfaction to the different parties; but much
difference of opinion prevailed, and no conclusion was come to. On the
following day the Arts brought forth their banners, which the Signory
understanding, and being apprehensive of evil, called the Council
together to consider what course to adopt. But scarcely were they
met, when the uproar recommenced, and soon the ensigns of the Arts,
surrounded by vast numbers of armed men, occupied the courts. Upon this
the Council, to give the Arts and the people hope of redress, and free
themselves as much as possible from the charge of causing the mischief,
gave a general power, which in Florence is called _Balia_, to the
Signors, the Colleagues, the Eight, the Capitani di Parte, and to the
Syndics of the Arts, to reform the government of the city, for the
common benefit of all. While this was being arranged, a few of the
ensigns of the Arts and some of the mob, desirous of avenging themselves
for the recent injuries they had received from the Guelphs, separated
themselves from the rest, and sacked and burnt the house of Lapo da
Castiglionchio, who, when he learned the proceedings of the Signory
against the Guelphs, and saw the people in arms, having no other
resource but concealment or flight, first took refuge in Santa Croce,
and afterward, being disguised as a monk, fled into the Casentino, where
he was often heard to blame himself for having consented to wait till
St. John's day, before they had made themselves sure of the government.
Piero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi hid themselves upon the first
outbreak of the tumult, trusting that when it was over, by the interest
of their numerous friends and relations, they might remain safely in
Florence.

The house of Lapo being burnt, as mischief begins with difficulty but
easily increases, many other houses, either through public hatred, or
private malice, shared the same fate; and the rioters, that they might
have companions more eager than themselves to assist them in their work
of plunder, broke open the public prisons, and then sacked the monastery
of the Agnoli and the convent of S. Spirito, whither many citizens
had taken their most valuable goods for safety. Nor would the public
chambers have escaped these destroyers' hands, except out of reverence
for one of the Signors, who on horseback, and followed by many citizens
in arms, opposed the rage of the mob.



CHAPTER III

Contrary measures adopted by the magistrates to effect a
pacification--Luigi Guicciardini the Gonfalonier entreats the
magistrates of the Arts to endeavor to pacify the people--Serious riot
caused by the plebeians--The woolen Art--The plebeians assemble--The
speech of a seditious plebeian--Their resolution thereupon--The Signory
discover the designs of the plebeians--Measures adopted to counteract
them.

This popular fury being abated by the authority of the Signors and
the approach of night, on the following day, the Balia relieved the
admonished, on condition that they should not for three years be capable
of holding any magistracy. They annulled the laws made by the Guelphs to
the prejudice of the citizens; declared Lapo da Castiglionchio and his
companions, rebels, and with them many others, who were the objects of
universal detestation. After these resolutions, the new Signory were
drawn for, and Luigi Guicciardini appointed Gonfalonier, which gave hope
that the tumults would soon be appeased; for everyone thought them to be
peaceable men and lovers of order. Still the shops were not opened, nor
did the citizens lay down their arms, but continued to patrol the city
in great numbers; so that the Signory did not assume the magistracy with
the usual pomp, but merely assembled within the palace, omitting all
ceremony.

This Signory, considering nothing more advisable in the beginning of
their magistracy than to restore peace, caused a relinquishment of arms;
ordered the shops to be opened, and the strangers who had been called to
their aid, to return to their homes. They appointed guards in many parts
of the city, so that if the admonished would only have remained quiet,
order would soon have been re-established. But they were not satisfied
to wait three years for the recovery of their honours; so that to
gratify them the Arts again met, and demanded of the Signory, that for
the benefit and quiet of the city, they would ordain that no citizens
should at any time, whether Signor, Colleague, Capitano di Parte, or
Consul of any art whatever, be admonished as a Ghibelline; and further,
that new ballots of the Guelphic party should be made, and the old ones
burned. These demands were at once acceded to, not only by the Signors,
but by all the Councils; and thus it was hoped the tumults newly excited
would be settled.

But since men are not satisfied with recovering what is their own, but
wish to possess the property of others and to revenge themselves,
those who were in hopes of benefiting by these disorders persuaded the
artificers that they would never be safe, if several of their enemies
were not expelled from the city or destroyed. This terrible doctrine
coming to the knowledge of the Signory, they caused the magistrates
of the Arts and their Syndics to be brought before them, and Luigi
Guicciardini, the Gonfalonier, addressed them in the following words:
"If these Signors, and I with them, had not long been acquainted with
the fate of this city, that as soon as external wars have ceased
the internal commence, we should have been more surprised, and our
displeasure would have been greater. But as evils to which we are
accustomed are less annoying, we have endured past disturbances
patiently, they having arisen for the most part without our fault; and
we hoped that, like former troubles, they would soon have an end, after
the many and great concessions we had made at your suggestion. But
finding that you are yet unsettled, that you contemplate the commission
of new crimes against your fellow-citizens, and are desirous of making
new exiles, our displeasure increases in proportion to your misconduct.
And certainly, could we have believed that during our magistracy the
city was to be ruined, whether with or without your concurrence, we
should certainly, either by flight or exile, have avoided these horrors.
But trusting that we had to do with those who possessed some feelings
of humanity and some love of their country, we willingly accepted the
magistracy, thinking that by our gentleness we should overcome your
ambition. But we perceive from experience that the more humble our
behavior, the more concessions we make, the prouder you become, and the
more exorbitant are your demands. And though we speak thus, it is not in
order to offend, but to amend you. Let others tell you pleasing tales,
our design is to communicate only what is for your good. Now we would
ask you, and have you answer on your honor, What is there yet ungranted,
that you can, with any appearance of propriety, require? You wished to
have authority taken from the Capitani di Parte; and it is done. You
wished that the ballotings should be burned, and a reformation of them
take place; and we consent. You desired that the admonished should be
restored to their honours; and it is permitted. At your entreaty we have
pardoned those who have burned down houses and plundered churches;
many honorable citizens have been exiled to please you; and at your
suggestion new restraints have been laid upon the Great. When will there
be an end of your demands? and how long will you continue to abuse our
liberality? Do you not observe with how much more moderation we bear
defeat than you your victory? To what end will your divisions bring our
city? Have you forgotten that when disunited Castruccio, a low citizen
of Lucca, subdued her? or that a duke of Athens, your hired captain did
so too? But when the citizens were united in her defense, an archbishop
of Milan and a pope were unable to subdue it, and, after many years of
war, were compelled to retire with disgrace.

"Then why would you, by your discords, reduce to slavery in a time of
peace, that city, which so many powerful enemies have left free, even in
war? What can you expect from your disunion but subjugation? or from the
property of which you already have plundered, or may yet plunder us, but
poverty? for this property is the means by which we furnish occupation
for the whole city, and if you take it from us, our means of finding
that occupation is withdrawn. Besides, those who take it will have
difficulty in preserving what is dishonestly acquired, and thus poverty
and destitution are brought upon the city. Now, I, and these Signors
command, and if it were consistent with propriety, we would entreat that
you allow your minds to be calmed; be content, rest satisfied with the
provisions that have been made for you; and if you should be found to
need anything further, make your request with decency and order, and not
with tumult; for when your demands are reasonable they will always be
complied with, and you will not give occasion to evil designing men
to ruin your country and cast the blame upon yourselves." These words
conveying nothing but the truth, produced a suitable effect upon the
minds of the citizens, who thanking the Gonfalonier for having acted
toward them the part of a king Signor, and toward the city that of a
good citizen, offered their obedience in whatever might be committed
to them. And the Signors, to prove the sincerity of their intentions,
appointed two citizens for each of the superior magistracies, who, with
Syndics of the arts, were to consider what could be done to restore
quite, and report their resolutions to the Signors.

While these things were in progress, a disturbance arose, much more
injurious to the republic than anything that had hitherto occurred.
The greatest part of the fires and robberies which took place on the
previous days were perpetrated by the very lowest of the people; and
those who had been the most audacious, were afraid that when the greater
differences were composed, they would be punished for the crimes they
had committed; and that as usual, they would be abandoned by those who
had instigated them to the commission of crime. To this may be added,
the hatred of the lower orders toward the rich citizens and the
principals of the arts, because they did not think themselves
remunerated for their labor in a manner equal to their merits. For in
the time of Charles I., when the city was divided into arts, a head or
governor was appointed to each, and it was provided that the individuals
of each art, should be judged in civil matters by their own superiors.
These arts, as we have before observed, were at first twelve; in the
course of time they were increased to twenty-one, and attained so much
power, that in a few years they grasped the entire government of the
city; and as some were in greater esteem than others, they were divided
into MAJOR and MINOR; seven were called "major," and fourteen, the
"minor arts." From this division, and from other causes which we have
narrated above, arose the arrogance of the Capitani di Parte; for those
citizens who had formerly been Guelphs, and had the constant disposal of
that magistracy, favored the followers of the major and persecuted
the minor arts and their patrons; and hence arose the many commotions
already mentioned. When the companies of the arts were first organized,
many of those trades, followed by the lowest of the people and the
plebeians, were not incorporated, but were ranged under those arts
most nearly allied to them; and, hence, when they were not properly
remunerated for their labor, or their masters oppressed them, they had
no one of whom to seek redress, except the magistrate of the art to
which theirs was subject; and of him they did not think justice always
attainable. Of the arts, that which had always had, and now has, the
greatest number of these subordinates, is the woolen; which being
both then, and still, the most powerful body, and first in authority,
supports the greater part of the plebeians and lowest of the people.

The lower classes, then, the subordinates not only of the woolen,
but also of the other arts, were discontented, from the causes just
mentioned; and their apprehension of punishment for the burnings and
robberies they had committed, did not tend to compose them. Meetings
took place in different parts during the night, to talk over the past,
and to communicate the danger in which they were, when one of the most
daring and experienced, in order to animate the rest, spoke thus:

"If the question now were, whether we should take up arms, rob and burn
the houses of the citizens, and plunder churches, I am one of those who
would think it worthy of further consideration, and should, perhaps,
prefer poverty and safety to the dangerous pursuit of an uncertain good.
But as we have already armed, and many offenses have been committed, it
appears to me that we have to consider how to lay them aside, and secure
ourselves from the consequences of what is already done. I certainly
think, that if nothing else could teach us, necessity might. You see the
whole city full of complaint and indignation against us; the citizens
are closely united, and the signors are constantly with the magistrates.
You may be sure they are contriving something against us; they are
arranging some new plan to subdue us. We ought therefore to keep two
things in view, and have two points to consider; the one is, to escape
with impunity for what has been done during the last few days, and the
other, to live in greater comfort and security for the time to come. We
must, therefore, I think, in order to be pardoned for our faults, commit
new ones; redoubling the mischief, and multiplying fires and robberies;
and in doing this, endeavor to have as many companions as we can; for
when many are in fault, few are punished; small crimes are chastised,
but great and serious ones rewarded. When many suffer, few seek
vengeance; for general evils are endured more patiently than private
ones. To increase the number of misdeeds will, therefore, make
forgiveness more easily attainable, and will open the way to secure what
we require for our own liberty. And it appears evident that the gain is
certain; for our opponents are disunited and rich; their disunion will
give us the victory, and their riches, when they have become ours, will
support us. Be not deceived about that antiquity of blood by which they
exalt themselves above us; for all men having had one common origin, are
all equally ancient, and nature has made us all after one fashion. Strip
us naked, and we shall all be found alike. Dress us in their clothing,
and they in ours, we shall appear noble, they ignoble--for poverty and
riches make all the difference. It grieves me much to think that some
of you are sorry inwardly for what is done, and resolve to abstain from
anything more of the kind. Certainly, if it be so, you are not the men
I took you for; because neither shame nor conscience ought to have
any influence with you. Conquerors, by what means soever, are never
considered aught but glorious. We have no business to think
about conscience; for when, like us, men have to fear hunger, and
imprisonment, or death, the fear of hell neither can nor ought to have
any influence upon them. If you only notice human proceedings, you may
observe that all who attain great power and riches, make use of
either force or fraud; and what they have acquired either by deceit or
violence, in order to conceal the disgraceful methods of attainment,
they endeavor to sanctify with the false title of honest gains. Those
who either from imprudence or want of sagacity avoid doing so, are
always overwhelmed with servitude and poverty; for faithful servants are
always servants, and honest men are always poor; nor do any ever escape
from servitude but the bold and faithless, or from poverty, but the
rapacious and fraudulent. God and nature have thrown all human fortunes
into the midst of mankind; and they are thus attainable rather by rapine
than by industry, by wicked actions rather than by good. Hence it is
that men feed upon each other, and those who cannot defend themselves
must be worried. Therefore we must use force when the opportunity
offers; and fortune cannot present us one more favorable than the
present, when the citizens are still disunited, the Signory doubtful,
and the magistrates terrified; for we may easily conquer them before
they can come to any settled arrangement. By this means we shall either
obtain the entire government of the city, or so large a share of it, as
to be forgiven past errors, and have sufficient authority to threaten
the city with a renewal of them at some future time. I confess this
course is bold and dangerous, but when necessity presses, audacity
becomes prudence, and in great affairs the brave never think of dangers.
The enterprises that are begun with hazard always have a reward at last;
and no one ever escaped from embarrassment without some peril. Besides,
it is easy to see from all their preparations of prisons, racks, and
instruments of death, that there is more danger in inaction than in
endeavoring to secure ourselves; for in the first case the evils are
certain, in the latter doubtful. How often have I heard you complain of
the avarice of your superiors and the injustice of your magistrates. Now
then is the time, not only to liberate yourself from them, but to become
so much superior, that they will have more causes of grief and fear
from you, than you from them. The opportunity presented by circumstances
passes away, and when gone, it will be vain to think it can be recalled.
You see the preparations of our enemies; let us anticipate them; and
those who are first in arms will certainly be victors, to the ruin of
their enemies and their own exaltation; and thus honors will accrue to
many of us and security to all." These arguments greatly inflamed minds
already disposed to mischief, so that they determined to take up arms as
soon as they had acquired a sufficient number of associates, and bound
themselves by oath to mutual defense, in case any of them were subdued
by the civil power.

While they were arranging to take possession of the republic, their
design became known to the Signory, who, having taken a man named
Simone, learned from him the particulars of the conspiracy, and that the
outbreak was to take place on the following day. Finding the danger so
pressing, they called together the colleagues and those citizens who
with the syndics of the arts were endeavoring to effect the union of the
city. It was then evening, and they advised the signors to assemble the
consuls of the trades, who proposed that whatever armed force was in
Florence should be collected, and with the Gonfaloniers of the people
and their companies, meet under arms in the piazza next morning. It
happened that while Simone was being tortured, a man named Niccolo da
San Friano was regulating the palace clock, and becoming acquainted
with what was going on, returned home and spread the report of it in his
neighborhood, so that presently the piazza of St. Spirito was
occupied by above a thousand men. This soon became known to the other
conspirators, and San Pietro Maggiore and St. Lorenzo, their places of
assembly, were presently full of them, all under arms.



CHAPTER IV

Proceedings of the plebeians--The demand they make of the Signory--They
insist that the Signory leave the palace--The Signory leave the
palace--Michael di Lando Gonfalonier--Complaints and movements of the
plebeians against Michael di Lando--Michael di Lando proceeds against

At daybreak on the 21st of July, there did not appear in the piazza
above eighty men in arms friendly to the Signory, and not one of
the Gonfaloniers; for knowing the whole city to be in a state of
insurrection they were afraid to leave their homes. The first body of
plebeians that made its appearance was that which had assembled at San
Pietro Maggiore; but the armed force did not venture to attack them.
Then came the other multitudes, and finding no opposition, they loudly
demanded their prisoners from the Signory; and being resolved to have
them by force if they were not yielded to their threats, they burned
the house of Luigi Guicciardini; and the Signory, for fear of greater
mischief, set them at liberty. With this addition to their strength they
took the Gonfalon of Justice from the bearer, and under the shadow
of authority which it gave them, burned the houses of many citizens,
selecting those whose owners had publicly or privately excited their
hatred. Many citizens, to avenge themselves for private injuries,
conducted them to the houses of their enemies; for it was quite
sufficient to insure its destruction, if a single voice from the mob
called out, "To the house of such a one," or if he who bore the Gonfalon
took the road toward it. All the documents belonging to the woolen
trade were burned, and after the commission of much violence, by way
of associating it with something laudable, Salvestro de Medici and
sixty-three other citizens were made knights, among whom were Benedetto
and Antonio degli Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi and others similarly their
friends; though many received the honor against their wills. It was
a remarkable peculiarity of the riots, that many who had their houses
burned, were on the same day, and by the same party made knights; so
close were the kindness and the injury together. This circumstance
occurred to Luigi Guicciardini, Gonfalonier of Justice.

In this tremendous uproar, the Signory, finding themselves abandoned by
their armed force, by the leaders of the arts, and by the Gonfaloniers,
became dismayed; for none had come to their assistance in obedience to
orders; and of the sixteen Gonfalons, the ensign of the Golden Lion
and of the Vaio, under Giovenco della Stufa and Giovanni Cambi alone
appeared; and these, not being joined by any other, soon withdrew.
Of the citizens, on the other hand, some, seeing the fury of this
unreasonable multitude and the palace abandoned, remained within doors;
others followed the armed mob, in the hope that by being among them,
they might more easily protect their own houses or those of their
friends. The power of the plebeians was thus increased and that of the
Signory weakened. The tumult continued all day, and at night the rioters
halted near the palace of Stefano, behind the church of St. Barnabas.
Their number exceeded six thousand, and before daybreak they obtained
by threats the ensigns of the trades, with which and the Gonfalon of
Justice, when morning came, they proceeded to the palace of the provost,
who refusing to surrender it to them, they took possession of it by
force.

The Signory, desirous of a compromise, since they could not restrain
them by force, appointed four of the Colleagues to proceed to the palace
of the provost, and endeavor to learn what was their intention. They
found that the leaders of the plebeians, with the Syndics of the trades
and some citizens, had resolved to signify their wishes to the Signory.
They therefore returned with four deputies of the plebeians, who
demanded that the woolen trade should not be allowed to have a foreign
judge; that there should be formed three new companies of the arts;
namely, one for the wool combers and dyers, one for the barbers,
doublet-makers, tailors, and such like, and the third for the lowest
class of people. They required that the three new arts should furnish
two Signors; the fourteen minor arts, three; and that the Signory should
provide a suitable place of assembly for them. They also made it a
condition that no member of these companies should be expected during
two years to pay any debt that amounted to less than fifty ducats; that
the bank should take no interest on loans already contracted, and that
only the principal sum should be demanded; that the condemned and the
banished should be forgiven, and the admonished should be restored to
participation in the honors of government. Besides these, many other
articles were stipulated in favor of their friends, and a requisition
made that many of their enemies should be exiled and admonished. These
demands, though grievous and dishonorable to the republic, were for fear
of further violence granted, by the joint deliberation of the Signors,
Colleagues, and Council of the people. But in order to give it full
effect, it was requisite that the Council of the Commune should also
give its consent; and, as they could not assemble two councils during
the same day it was necessary to defer it till the morrow. However the
trades appeared content, the plebeians satisfied; and both promised,
that these laws being confirmed, every disturbance should cease.

On the following morning, while the Council of the Commune were in
consultation, the impatient and volatile multitude entered the piazza,
under their respective ensigns, with loud and fearful shouts,
which struck terror into all the Council and Signory; and Guerrente
Marignolli, one of the latter, influenced more by fear than anything
else, under pretense of guarding the lower doors, left the chamber and
fled to his house. He was unable to conceal himself from the multitude,
who, however, took no notice, except that, upon seeing him, they
insisted that all the Signors should quit the palace, and declared
that if they refused to comply, their houses should be burned and their
families put to death.

The law had now been passed; the Signors were in their own apartments;
the Council had descended from the chamber, and without leaving the
palace, hopeless of saving the city, they remained in the lodges and
courts below, overwhelmed with grief at seeing such depravity in the
multitude, and such perversity or fear in those who might either have
restrained or suppressed them. The Signory, too, were dismayed and
fearful for the safety of their country, finding themselves abandoned
by one of their associates, and without any aid or even advice; when, at
this moment of uncertainty as to what was about to happen, or what would
be best to be done, Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti, either from
motives of ambition (being desirous of remaining masters of the palace),
or because they thought it the most advisable step, persuaded them to
give way to the popular impulse, and withdraw privately to their homes.
This advice, given by those who had been the leaders of the tumult,
although the others yielded, filled Alamanno Acciajuoli and Niccolo del
Bene, two of the Signors, with anger; and, reassuming a little vigor,
they said, that if the others would withdraw they could not help it, but
they would remain as long as they continued in office, if they did not
in the meantime lose their lives. These dissensions redoubled the fears
of the Signory and the rage of the people, so that the Gonfalonier,
disposed rather to conclude his magistracy in dishonor than in danger,
recommended himself to the care of Tommaso Strozzi, who withdrew him
from the palace and conducted him to his house. The other Signors were,
one after another, conveyed in the same manner, so that Alamanno and
Niccolo, not to appear more valiant than wise, seeing themselves left
alone, also retired, and the palace fell into the hands of the plebeians
and the Eight Commissioners of War, who had not yet laid down their
authority.

When the plebeians entered the palace, the standard of the Gonfalonier
of Justice was in the hands of Michael di Lando, a wool comber. This
man, barefoot, with scarcely anything upon him, and the rabble at his
heels, ascended the staircase, and, having entered the audience chamber
of the Signory, he stopped, and turning to the multitude said, "You see
this palace is now yours, and the city is in your power; what do you
think ought to be done?" To which they replied, they would have him for
their Gonfalonier and lord; and that he should govern them and the city
as he thought best. Michael accepted the command; and, as he was a cool
and sagacious man, more favored by nature than by fortune, he resolved
to compose the tumult, and restore peace to the city. To occupy the
minds of the people, and give himself time to make some arrangement, he
ordered that one Nuto, who had been appointed bargello, or sheriff,
by Lapo da Castiglionchio, should be sought. The greater part of his
followers went to execute this commission; and, to commence with justice
the government he had acquired by favor, he commanded that no one should
either burn or steal anything; while, to strike terror into all, he
caused a gallows to be erected in the court of the palace. He began
the reform of government by deposing the Syndics of the trades, and
appointing new ones; he deprived the Signory and the Colleagues of their
magistracy, and burned the balloting purses containing the names of
those eligible to office under the former government.

In the meantime, Ser Nuto, being brought by the mob into the court, was
suspended from the gallows by one foot; and those around having torn him
to pieces, in little more than a moment nothing remained of him but the
foot by which he had been tied.

The Eight Commissioners of War, on the other hand, thinking themselves,
after the departure of the Signors, left sole masters of the city, had
already formed a new Signory; but Michael, on hearing this, sent them
an order to quit the palace immediately; for he wished to show that he
could govern Florence without their assistance. He then assembled the
Syndics of the trades, and created as a Signory, four from the lowest
plebeians; two from the major, and two from the minor trades. Besides
this, he made a new selection of names for the balloting purses, and
divided the state into three parts; one composed of the new trades,
another of the minor, and the third of the major trades. He gave to
Salvestro de' Medici the revenue of the shops upon the Old Bridge; for
himself he took the provostry of Empoli, and conferred benefits upon
many other citizens, friends of the plebeians; not so much for the
purpose of rewarding their labors, as that they might serve to screen
him from envy.

It seemed to the plebeians that Michael, in his reformation of the
state, had too much favored the higher ranks of the people, and that
themselves had not a sufficient share in the government to enable them
to preserve it; and hence, prompted by their usual audacity, they again
took arms, and coming tumultuously into the court of the palace, each
body under their particular ensigns, insisted that the Signory
should immediately descend and consider new means for advancing their
well-being and security. Michael, observing their arrogance, was
unwilling to provoke them, but without further yielding to their
request, blamed the manner in which it was made, advised them to lay
down their arms, and promised that then would be conceded to them, what
otherwise, for the dignity of the state, must of necessity be withheld.
The multitude, enraged at this reply, withdrew to Santa Maria Novella,
where they appointed eight leaders for their party, with officers, and
other regulations to ensure influence and respect; so that the city
possessed two governments, and was under the direction of two distinct
powers. These new leaders determined that Eight, elected from their
trades, should constantly reside in the palace with the Signory, and
that whatever the Signory should determine must be confirmed by them
before it became law. They took from Salvestro de' Medici and Michael
di Lando the whole of what their former decrees had granted them, and
distributed to many of their party offices and emoluments to enable them
to support their dignity. These resolutions being passed, to render them
valid they sent two of their body to the Signory, to insist on their
being confirmed by the Council, with an intimation, that if not granted
they would be vindicated by force. This deputation, with amazing
audacity and surpassing presumption, explained their commission to the
Signory, upbraided the Gonfalonier with the dignity they had conferred
upon him, the honor they had done him, and with the ingratitude and want
of respect he had shown toward them. Coming to threats toward the end of
their discourse, Michael could not endure their arrogance, and sensible
rather of the dignity of the office he held than of the meanness of his
origin, determined by extraordinary means to punish such extraordinary
insolence, and drawing the sword with which he was girt, seriously
wounded, and cause them to be seized and imprisoned.

When the fact became known, the multitude were filled with rage, and
thinking that by their arms they might ensure what without them they
had failed to effect, they seized their weapons and with the utmost
fury resolved to force the Signory to consent to their wishes. Michael,
suspecting what would happen, determined to be prepared, for he knew his
credit rather required him to be first to the attack than to wait the
approach of the enemy, or, like his predecessors, dishonor both the
palace and himself by flight. He therefore drew together a good number
of citizens (for many began to see their error), mounted on horseback,
and followed by crowds of armed men, proceeded to Santa Maria Novella,
to encounter his adversaries. The plebeians, who as before observed
were influenced by a similar desire, had set out about the same time as
Michael, and it happened that as each took a different route, they did
not meet in their way, and Michael, upon his return, found the piazza in
their possession. The contest was now for the palace, and joining in the
fight, he soon vanquished them, drove part of them out of the city,
and compelled the rest to throw down their arms and escape or conceal
themselves, as well as they could. Having thus gained the victory, the
tumults were composed, solely by the talents of the Gonfalonier, who in
courage, prudence, and generosity surpassed every other citizen of his
time, and deserves to be enumerated among the glorious few who have
greatly benefited their country; for had he possessed either malice or
ambition, the republic would have been completely ruined, and the city
must have fallen under greater tyranny than that of the duke of Athens.
But his goodness never allowed a thought to enter his mind opposed to
the universal welfare: his prudence enabled him to conduct affairs in
such a manner, that a great majority of his own faction reposed the most
entire confidence in him; and he kept the rest in awe by the influence
of his authority. These qualities subdued the plebeians, and opened the
eyes of the superior artificers, who considered how great must be the
folly of those, who having overcome the pride of the nobility, could
endure to submit to the nauseous rule of the rabble.



CHAPTER V

New regulations for the elections of the Signory--Confusion in the
City--Piero degli Albizzi and other citizens condemned to death--The
Florentines alarmed by the approach of Charles of Durazzo--The
measures adopted in consequence thereof--Insolent Conduct of Giorgio
Scali--Benedetto Alberti--Giorgio Scali beheaded.

By the time Michael di Lando had subdued the plebeians, the new Signory
was drawn, and among those who composed it, were two persons of such
base and mean condition, that the desire increased in the minds of the
people to be freed from the ignominy into which they had fallen; and
when, upon the first of September, the new Signory entered office and
the retiring members were still in the palace, the piazza being full of
armed men, a tumultuous cry arose from the midst of them, that none
of the lowest of the people should hold office among the Signory. The
obnoxious two were withdrawn accordingly. The name of one was Il Tira,
of the other Baroccio, and in their stead were elected Giorgio Scali
and Francesco di Michele. The company of the lowest trade was also
dissolved, and its members deprived of office, except Michael di Lando,
Lorenzo di Puccio and a few others of better quality. The honors of
government were divided into two parts, one of which was assigned to the
superior trades, the other to the inferior; except that the latter were
to furnish five Signors, and the former only four. The Gonfalonier was
to be chosen alternately from each.

The government thus composed, restored peace to the city for the
time; but though the republic was rescued from the power of the lowest
plebeians, the inferior trades were still more influential than the
nobles of the people, who, however, were obliged to submit for the
gratification of the trades, of whose favor they wished to deprive the
plebeians. The new establishment was supported by all who wished the
continued subjugation of those who, under the name of the Guelphic
party, had practiced such excessive violence against the citizens. And
as among others, thus disposed, were Giorgio Scali, Benedetto Alberti,
Salvestro di Medici, and Tommaso Strozzi, these four almost became
princes of the city. This state of the public mind strengthened the
divisions already commenced between the nobles of the people, and the
minor artificers, by the ambition of the Ricci and the Albizzi; from
which, as at different times very serious effects arose, and as they
will hereafter be frequently mentioned, we shall call the former
the popular party, the latter the plebeian. This condition of things
continued three years, during which many were exiled and put to death;
for the government lived in constant apprehension, knowing that both
within and without the city many were dissatisfied with them. Those
within, either attempted or were suspected of attempting every day some
new project against them; and those without, being under no restraint,
were continually, by means of some prince or republic, spreading reports
tending to increase the disaffection.

Gianozzo da Salerno was at this time in Bologna. He held a command under
Charles of Durazzo, a descendant of the kings of Naples, who, designing
to undertake the conquest of the dominions of Queen Giovanna, retained
his captain in that city, with the concurrence of Pope Urban, who was at
enmity with the queen. Many Florentine emigrants were also at Bologna,
in close correspondence with him and Charles. This caused the rulers in
Florence to live in continual alarm, and induced them to lend a willing
ear to any calumnies against the suspected. While in this disturbed
state of feeling, it was disclosed to the government that Gianozzo da
Salerno was about to march to Florence with the emigrants, and that
great numbers of those within were to rise in arms, and deliver the city
to him. Upon this information many were accused, the principal of whom
were Piero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi: and after these Cipriano
Mangione, Jacopo Sacchetti, Donato Barbadori, Filippo Strozzi, and
Giovanni Anselmi, the whole of whom, except Carlo Strozzi who fled, were
made prisoners; and the Signory, to prevent any one from taking arms
in their favor, appointed Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti with
a strong armed force, to guard the city. The arrested citizens were
examined, and although nothing was elicited against them sufficient to
induce the Capitano to find them guilty, their enemies excited the minds
of the populace to such a degree of outrageous and overwhelming fury
against them, that they were condemned to death, as it were, by force.
Nor was the greatness of his family, or his former reputation of any
service to Piero degli Albizzi, who had once been, of all the citizens,
the man most feared and honored. Some one, either as a friend to
render him wise in his prosperity, or an enemy to threaten him with the
fickleness of fortune, had upon the occasion of his making a feast for
many citizens, sent him a silver bowl full of sweetmeats, among which
a large nail was found, and being seen by many present, was taken for a
hint to him to fix the wheel of fortune, which, having conveyed him to
the top, must if the rotation continued, also bring him to the bottom.
This interpretation was verified, first by his ruin, and afterward by
his death.

After this execution the city was full of consternation, for both
victors and vanquished were alike in fear; but the worst effects arose
from the apprehensions of those possessing the management of affairs;
for every accident, however trivial, caused them to commit fresh
outrages, either by condemnations, admonitions, or banishment of
citizens; to which must be added, as scarcely less pernicious, the
frequent new laws and regulations which were made for defense of the
government, all of which were put in execution to the injury of those
opposed to their faction. They appointed forty-six persons, who,
with the Signory, were to purge the republic of all suspected by the
government. They admonished thirty-nine citizens, ennobled many of the
people, and degraded many nobles to the popular rank. To strengthen
themselves against external foes, they took into their pay John
Hawkwood, an Englishman of great military reputation, who had long
served the pope and others in Italy. Their fears from without were
increased by a report that several bodies of men were being assembled
by Charles of Durazzo for the conquest of Naples, and many Florentine
emigrants were said to have joined him. Against these dangers, in
addition to the forces which had been raised, large sums of money were
provided; and Charles, having arrived at Arezzo, obtained from the
Florentines 40,000 ducats, and promised he would not molest them. His
enterprise was immediately prosecuted, and having occupied the kingdom
of Naples, he sent Queen Giovanna a prisoner into Hungary. This victory
renewed the fears of those who managed the affairs of Florence, for
they could not persuade themselves that their money would have a greater
influence on the king's mind than the friendship which his house had
long retained for the Guelphs, whom they so grievously oppressed.

This suspicion increasing, multiplied oppressions; which again, instead
of diminishing the suspicion, augmented it; so that most men lived
in the utmost discontent. To this the insolence of Giorgio Scali
and Tommaso Strozzi (who by their popular influence overawed the
magistrates) also contributed, for the rulers were apprehensive that by
the power these men possessed with the plebeians they could set them at
defiance; and hence it is evident that not only to good men, but even to
the seditious, this government appeared tyrannical and violent. To put a
period to the outrageous conduct of Giorgio, it happened that a servant
of his accused Giovanni di Cambio of practices against the state, but
the Capitano declared him innocent. Upon this, the judge determined to
punish the accuser with the same penalties that the accused would have
incurred had he been guilty, but Giorgio Scali, unable to save him
either by his authority or entreaties, obtained the assistance of
Tommaso Strozzi, and with a multitude of armed men, set the informer
at liberty and plundered the palace of the Capitano, who was obliged
to save himself by flight. This act excited such great and universal
animosity against him, that his enemies began to hope they would be able
to effect his ruin, and also to rescue the city from the power of
the plebeians, who for three years had held her under their arrogant
control.

To the realization of this design the Capitano greatly contributed, for
the tumult having subsided, he presented himself before the signors,
and said "He had cheerfully undertaken the office to which they had
appointed him, for he thought he should serve upright men who would take
arms for the defense of justice, and not impede its progress. But now
that he had seen and had experience of the proceedings of the city, and
the manner in which affairs were conducted, that dignity which he had
voluntarily assumed with the hope of acquiring honor and emolument, he
now more willingly resigned, to escape from the losses and danger to
which he found himself exposed." The complaint of the Capitano was heard
with the utmost attention by the Signory, who promising to remunerate
him for the injury he had suffered and provide for his future security,
he was satisfied. Some of them then obtained an interview with certain
citizens who were thought to be lovers of the common good, and least
suspected by the state; and in conjunction with these, it was concluded
that the present was a favorable opportunity for rescuing the city from
Giorgio and the plebeians, the last outrage he had committed having
completely alienated the great body of the people from him. They judged
it best to profit by the occasion before the excitement had abated, for
they knew that the favor of the mob is often gained or lost by the
most trifling circumstance; and more certainly to insure success, they
determined, if possible, to obtain the concurrence of Benedetto Alberti,
for without it they considered their enterprise to be dangerous.

Benedetto was one of the richest citizens, a man of unassuming manners,
an ardent lover of the liberties of his country, and one to whom
tyrannical measures were in the highest degree offensive; so that he was
easily induced to concur in their views and consent to Giorgio's ruin.
His enmity against the nobles of the people and the Guelphs, and
his friendship for the plebeians, were caused by the insolence and
tyrannical proceedings of the former; but finding that the plebeians had
soon become quite as insolent, he quickly separated himself from them;
and the injuries committed by them against the citizens were done wholly
without his consent. So that the same motives which made him join the
plebeians induced him to leave them.

Having gained Benedetto and the leaders of the trades to their side,
they provided themselves with arms and made Giorgio prisoner. Tommaso
fled. The next day Giorgio was beheaded; which struck so great a
terror into his party, that none ventured to express the slightest
disapprobation, but each seemed anxious to be foremost in defense of the
measure. On being led to execution, in the presence of that people who
only a short time before had idolized him, Giorgio complained of his
hard fortune, and the malignity of those citizens who, having done him
an undeserved injury, had compelled him to honor and support a mob,
possessing neither faith nor gratitude. Observing Benedetto Alberti
among those who had armed themselves for the preservation of order, he
said, "Do you, too, consent, Benedetto, that this injury shall be done
to me? Were I in your place and you in mine, I would take care that no
one should injure you. I tell you, however, this day is the end of my
troubles and the beginning of yours." He then blamed himself for having
confided too much in a people who may be excited and inflamed by every
word, motion, and breath of suspicion. With these complaints he died in
the midst of his armed enemies, delighted at his fall. Some of his most
intimate associates were also put to death, and their bodies dragged
about by the mob.



CHAPTER VI

Confusion and riots in the city--Reform of government in opposition to
the plebeians--Injuries done to those who favored the plebeians--Michael
di Lando banished--Benedetto Alberti hated by the Signory--Fears
excited by the coming of Louis of Anjou--The Florentines purchase
Arezzo--Benedetto Alberti becomes suspected and is banished--His
discourse upon leaving the city--Other citizens banished and
admonished--War with Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan.

The death of Giorgio caused very great excitement; many took arms at
the execution in favor of the Signory and the Capitano; and many others,
either for ambition or as a means for their own safety, did the same.
The city was full of conflicting parties, who each had a particular end
in view, and wished to carry it into effect before they disarmed. The
ancient nobility, called the GREAT, could not bear to be deprived
of public honors; for the recovery of which they used their utmost
exertions, and earnestly desired that authority might be restored to the
Capitani di Parte. The nobles of the people and the major trades were
discontented at the share the minor trades and lowest of the people
possessed in the government; while the minor trades were desirous of
increasing their influence, and the lowest people were apprehensive
of losing the companies of their trades and the authority which these
conferred.

Such opposing views occasioned Florence, during a year, to be disturbed
by many riots. Sometimes the nobles of the people took arms; sometimes
the major and sometimes the minor trades and the lowest of the people;
and it often happened that, though in different parts, all were at once
in insurrection. Hence many conflicts took place between the different
parties or with the forces of the palace; for the Signory sometimes
yielding, and at other times resisting, adopted such remedies as they
could for these numerous evils. At length, after two assemblies of the
people, and many Balias appointed for the reformation of the city; after
much toil, labor, and imminent danger, a government was appointed,
by which all who had been banished since Salvestro de' Medici was
Gonfalonier were restored. They who had acquired distinctions or
emoluments by the Balia of 1378 were deprived of them. The honors of
government were restored to the Guelphic party; the two new Companies of
the Trades were dissolved, and all who had been subject to them assigned
to their former companies. The minor trades were not allowed to elect
the Gonfalonier of Justice, their share of honors was reduced from a
half to a third; and those of the highest rank were withdrawn from them
altogether. Thus the nobles of the people and the Guelphs repossessed
themselves of the government, which was lost by the plebeians after it
had been in their possession from 1378 to 1381, when these changes took
place.

The new establishment was not less injurious to the citizens, or less
troublesome at its commencement than that of the plebeians had been; for
many of the nobles of the people, who had distinguished themselves as
defenders of the plebeians, were banished, with a great number of the
leaders of the latter, among whom was Michael di Lando; nor could all
the benefits conferred upon the city by his authority, when in danger
from the lawless mob, save him from the rabid fury of the party that was
now in power. His good offices evidently excited little gratitude in
his countrymen. The neglect of their benefactors is an error into which
princes and republics frequently fall; and hence mankind, alarmed by
such examples, as soon as they begin to perceive the ingratitude of
their rulers, set themselves against them.

As these banishments and executions had always been offensive to
Benedetto Alberti, they continued to disgust him, and he censured them
both publicly and privately. The leaders of the government began to
fear him, for they considered him one of the most earnest friends of
the plebeians, and thought he had not consented to the death of Giorgio
Scali from disapprobation of his proceeding, but that he might be left
himself without a rival in the government. His discourse and his conduct
alike served to increase their suspicions, so that all the ruling party
had their eyes upon him, and eagerly sought an opportunity of crushing
him.

During this state of things, external affairs were not of serious
importance, for some which ensued were productive of apprehension rather
than of injury. At this time Louis of Anjou came into Italy, to recover
the kingdom of Naples for Queen Giovanna, and drive out Charles of
Durazzo. His coming terrified the Florentines; for Charles, according
to the custom of old friends, demanded their assistance, and Louis,
like those who seek new alliances, required their neutrality. The
Florentines, that they might seem to comply with the request of Louis,
and at the same time assist Charles, discharged from their service
Sir John Hawkwood, and transferred him to that of Pope Urban, who was
friendly to Charles; but this deceit was at once detected, and Louis
considered himself greatly injured by the Florentines. While the war
was carried on between Louis and Charles in Puglia, new forces were sent
from France in aid of Louis, and on arriving in Tuscany, were by the
emigrants of Arezzo conducted to that city, and took it from those who
held possession for Charles. And when they were about to change the
government of Florence, as they had already done that of Arezzo, Louis
died, and the order of things in Puglia and in Tuscany was changed
accordingly; for Charles secured the kingdom, which had been all but
lost, and the Florentines, who were apprehensive for their own city,
purchased Arezzo from those who held it for Louis. Charles, having
secured Puglia, went to take possession of Hungary, to which he was
heir, leaving, with his wife, his children Ladislaus and Giovanna, who
were yet infants. He took possession of Hungary, but was soon after
slain there.

As great rejoicings were made in Florence on account of this acquisition
as ever took place in any city for a real victory, which served to
exhibit the public and private wealth of the people, many families
endeavoring to vie with the state itself in displays of magnificence.
The Alberti surpassed all others; the tournaments and exhibitions made
by them were rather suitable for a sovereign prince than for any private
individuals. These things increased the envy with which the family was
regarded, and being joined with suspicions which the state entertained
of Benedetto, were the causes of his ruin. The rulers could not endure
him, for it appeared as if, at any moment, something might occur,
which, with the favor of his friends, would enable him to recover
his authority, and drive them out of the city. While in this state of
suspicion and jealousy, it happened that while he was Gonfalonier of the
Companies, his son-in-law, Filippo Magalotti, was drawn Gonfalonier of
Justice; and this circumstance increased the fears of the government,
for they thought it would strengthen Benedetto's influence, and place
the state in the greater peril. Anxious to provide a remedy, without
creating much disturbance, they induced Bese Magalotti, his relative and
enemy, to signify to the Signory that Filippo, not having attained the
age required for the exercise of that office, neither could nor ought to
hold it.

The question was examined by the signors, and part of them out of
hatred, others in order to avoid disunion among themselves, declared
Filippo ineligible to the dignity, and in his stead was drawn Bardo
Mancini, who was quite opposed to the plebeian interests, and an
inveterate foe of Benedetto. This man, having entered upon the duties
of his office, created a _Balia_ for the reformation of the state, which
banished Benedetto Alberti and admonished all the rest of his family
except Antonio. Before his departure, Benedetto called them together,
and observing their melancholy demeanor, said, "You see, my fathers, and
you the elders of our house, how fortune has ruined me and threatened
you. I am not surprised at this, neither ought you to be so, for it
always happens thus to those who among a multitude of the wicked, wish
to act rightly, and endeavor to sustain, what the many seek to destroy.
The love of my country made me take part with Salvestro de Medici and
afterward separated me from Giorgio Scali. The same cause compelled me
to detest those who now govern, who having none to punish them, will
allow no one to reprove their misdeeds. I am content that my banishment
should deliver them from the fears they entertain, not of me only, but
of all who they think perceives or is acquainted wit their tyrannical
and wicked proceedings; and they have aimed their first blow at me, in
order the more easily to oppress you. I do not grieve on my own account;
for those honors which my country bestowed upon me while free, she
cannot in her slavery take from me; and the recollection of my past
life will always give me greater pleasure than the pain imparted by the
sorrows of exile. I deeply regret that my country is left a prey to the
greediness and pride of the few who keep her in subjection. I grieve for
you; for I fear that the evils which this day cease to affect me, and
commence with you, will pursue you with even greater malevolence than
they have me. Comfort, then, each other; resolve to bear up against
every misfortune, and conduct yourselves in such a manner, that when
disasters befall you (and there will be many), every one may know they
have come upon you undeservedly." Not to give a worse impression of
his virtue abroad than he had done at home, he made a journey to the
sepulcher of Christ, and while upon his return, died at Rhodes. His
remains were brought to Florence, and interred with all possible honors,
by those who had persecuted him, when alive, with every species of
calumny and injustice.

The family of the Alberti was not the only injured party during these
troubles of the city; for many others were banished and admonished. Of
the former were Piero Benini, Matteo Alderotti, Giovanni and Francesco
del Bene, Giovanni Benci, Andrea Adimari, and with them many members of
the minor trades. Of the admonished were the Covini, Benini, Rinucci,
Formiconi, Corbizzi, Manelli, and Alderotti. It was customary to create
the Balia for a limited time; and when the citizens elected had effected
the purpose of their appointment, they resigned the office from motives
of good feeling and decency, although the time allowed might not have
expired. In conformity with this laudable practice, the Balia of that
period, supposing they had accomplished all that was expected of them,
wished to retire; but when the multitude were acquainted with their
intention, they ran armed to the palace, and insisted, that before
resigning their power, many other persons should be banished and
admonished. This greatly displeased the signors; but without disclosing
the extent of their displeasure, they contrived to amuse the multitude
with promises, till they had assembled a sufficient body of armed men,
and then took such measures, that fear induced the people to lay aside
the weapons which madness had led them to take up. Nevertheless, in some
degree to gratify the fury of the mob, and to reduce the authority of
the plebeian trades, it was provided, that as the latter had previously
possessed a third of the honors, they should in future have only a
fourth. That there might always be two of the signors particularly
devoted to the government, they gave authority to the Gonfalonier of
Justice, and four others, to form a ballot-purse of select citizens,
from which, in every Signory, two should be drawn.

This government from its establishment in 1381, till the alterations
now made, had continued six years; and the internal peace of the city
remained undisturbed until 1393. During this time, Giovanni Galeazzo
Visconti, usually called the Count of Virtú, imprisoned his uncle
Bernabo, and thus became sovereign of the whole of Lombardy. As he had
become duke of Milan by fraud, he designed to make himself king of Italy
by force. In 1391 he commenced a spirited attack upon the Florentines;
but such various changes occurred in the course of the war, that he
was frequently in greater danger than the Florentines themselves, who,
though they made a brave and admirable defense, for a republic, must
have been ruined, if he had survived. As it was, the result was attended
with infinitely less evil than their fears of so powerful an enemy had
led them to apprehend; for the duke having taken Bologna, Pisa, Perugia,
and Sienna, and prepared a diadem with which to be crowned king of Italy
at Florence, died before he had tasted the fruit of his victories, or
the Florentines began to feel the effect of their disasters.

During the war with the duke of Milan the office of Gonfalonier of
Justice fell to Maso degli Albizzi, who by the death of Piero in 1379,
had become the inveterate enemy of the Alberti: and as party feeling is
incapable either of repose or abatement, he determined, notwithstanding
Benedetto had died in exile, that before the expiration of his
magistracy, he would revenge himself on the remainder of that family.
He seized the opportunity afforded by a person, who on being examined
respecting correspondence maintained with the rebels, accused Andrea and
Alberto degli Alberti of such practices. They were immediately arrested,
which so greatly excited the people, that the Signory, having provided
themselves with an armed force, called the citizens to a general
assembly or parliament, and appointed a Balia, by whose authority many
were banished, and a new ballot for the offices of government was made.
Among the banished were nearly all the Alberti; many members of the
trades were admonished, and some put to death. Stung by these numerous
injuries, the trades and the lowest of the people rose in arms,
considering themselves despoiled both of honor and life. One body of
them assembled in the piazza; another ran to the house of Veri de'
Medici, who, after the death of Salvestro, was head of the family. The
Signory, in order to appease those who came to the piazza or court of
the palace, gave them for leaders, with the ensigns of the Guelphs
and of the people in their hands, Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, and Donato
Acciajuoli, both men of the popular class, and more attached to the
interests of the plebeians than any other. Those who went to the house
of Veri de' Medici, begged that he would be pleased to undertake the
government, and free them from the tyranny of those citizens who were
destroying the peace and safety of the commonwealth.

It is agreed by all who have written concerning the events of this
period, that if Veri had had more ambition than integrity he might
without any impediment have become prince of the city; for the unfeeling
treatment which, whether right or wrong, had been inflicted upon the
trades and their friends, had so excited the minds of men to vengeance,
that all they required was some one to be their leader. Nor were there
wanting those who could inform him of the state of public feeling; for
Antonio de' Medici with whom he had for some time been upon terms of
most intimate friendship, endeavored to persuade him to undertake the
government of the republic. To this Veri replied: "Thy menaces when thou
wert my enemy, never alarmed me; nor shall thy counsel, now when thou
art my friend, do me any harm." Then, turning toward the multitude,
he bade them be of good cheer; for he would be their defender, if they
would allow themselves to be advised by him. He then went, accompanied
by a great number of citizens, to the piazza, and proceeded directly to
the audience chamber of the Signory, whom he addressed to this effect:
That he could not regret having lived so as to gain the love of the
Florentines; but he was sorry they had formed an opinion of him which
his past life had not warranted; for never having done anything that
could be construed as either factious or ambitious, he could not imagine
how it had happened, that they should think him willing to stir up
strife as a discontented person, or usurp the government of his country
like an ambitious one. He therefore begged that the infatuation of the
multitude might not injure him in their estimation; for, to the utmost
of his power, their authority should be restored. He then recommended
them to use good fortune with moderation; for it would be much better to
enjoy an imperfect victory with safety to the city, than a complete
one at her ruin. The Signory applauded Veri's conduct; begged he would
endeavor to prevent recourse to arms, and promised that what he and
the other citizens might deem most advisable should be done. Veri then
returned to the piazza, where the people who had followed him were
joined by those led by Donato and Rinaldo, and informed the united
companies that he had found the Signory most kindly disposed toward
them; that many things had been taken into consideration, which
the shortness of time, and the absence of the magistrates, rendered
incapable of being finished. He therefore begged they would lay down
their arms and obey the Signory; assuring them that humility would
prevail rather than pride, entreaties rather than threats; and if
they would take his advice, their privileges and security would remain
unimpaired. He thus induced them to return peaceably to their homes.

The disturbance having subsided, the Signory armed the piazza,
enrolled 2,000 of the most trusty citizens, who were divided equally
by Gonfalons, and ordered to be in readiness to give their assistance
whenever required; and they forbade the use of arms to all who were
not thus enrolled. Having adopted these precautionary measures, they
banished and put to death many of those members of the trades who had
shown the greatest audacity in the late riots; and to invest the office
of Gonfalonier of Justice with more authoritative majesty, they ordered
that no one should be eligible to it, under forty-five years of age.
Many other provisions for the defense of the state were made, which
appeared intolerable to those against whom they were directed, and were
odious even to the friends of the Signory themselves, for they could not
believe a government to be either good or secure, which needed so much
violence for its defense, a violence excessively offensive, not only to
those of the Alberti who remained in the city, and to the Medici, who
felt themselves injured by these proceedings, but also to many others.
The first who attempted resistance was Donato, the son of Jacopo
Acciajuoli, who thought of great authority, and the superior rather than
the equal of Maso degli Albizzi (who on account of the events which took
place while he was Gonfalonier of Justice, was almost at the head of the
republic), could not enjoy repose amid such general discontent, or,
like many others, convert social evils to his own private advantage,
and therefore resolved to attempt the restoration of the exiles to their
country, or at least their offices to the admonished. He went from one
to another, disseminating his views, showing that the people would not
be satisfied, or the ferment of parties subside, without the changes
he proposed; and declared that if he were in the Signory, he would soon
carry them into effect. In human affairs, delay causes tedium, and haste
danger. To avoid what was tedious, Donato Acciajuoli resolved to attempt
what involved danger. Michele Acciajuoli his relative, and Niccolo
Ricoveri his friend, were of the Signory. This seemed to Donato a
conjuncture of circumstances too favorable to be lost, and he requested
they would propose a law to the councils, which would include the
restoration of the citizens. They, at his entreaty, spoke about the
matter to their associates, who replied, that it was improper to attempt
any innovation in which the advantage was doubtful and the danger
certain. Upon this, Donato, having in vain tried all other means he
could think of, excited with anger, gave them to understand that since
they would not allow the city to be governed with peaceful measures,
he would try what could be done with arms. These words gave so great
offense, that being communicated to the heads of the government, Donato
was summoned, and having appeared, the truth was proven by those to whom
he had intrusted the message, and he was banished to Barletta. Alamanno
and Antonio de' Medici were also banished, and all those of that
family, who were descended from Alamanno, with many who, although of
the inferior artificers, possessed influence with the plebeians. These
events took place two years after the reform of government effected by
Maso degli Albizzi.

At this time many discontented citizens were at home, and others
banished in the adjoining states. Of the latter there lived at Bologna
Picchio Cavicciulli, Tommaso de' Ricci, Antonio de' Medici, Benedetto
degli Spini, Antonio Girolami, Cristofano di Carlone, and two others
of the lowest order, all bold young men, and resolved upon returning to
their country at any hazard. These were secretly told by Piggiello and
Baroccio Cavicciulli, who, being admonished, lived in Florence, that
if they came to the city they should be concealed in their house; from
which they might afterward issue, slay Maso degli Albizzi, and call
the people to arms, who, full of discontent, would willingly arise,
particularly as they would be supported by the Ricci, Adimari, Medici,
Manelli, and many other families. Excited with these hopes, on the
fourth of August, 1397, they came to Florence, and having entered
unobserved according to their arrangement, they sent one of their party
to watch Maso, designing with his death to raise the people. Maso was
observed to leave his house and proceed to that of an apothecary, near
the church of San Pietro Maggiore, which he entered. The man who went
to watch him ran to give information to the other conspirators, who took
their arms and hastened to the house of the apothecary, but found
that Maso had gone. However, undaunted with the failure of their first
attempt, they proceeded to the Old Market, where they slew one of the
adverse party, and with loud cries of "people, arms, liberty, and death
to the tyrants," directed their course toward the New Market, and at the
end of the Calimala slew another. Pursuing their course with the same
cries, and finding no one join them in arms, they stopped at the Loggia
Nighittosa, where, from an elevated situation, being surrounded with
a great multitude, assembled to look on rather than assist them, they
exhorted the men to take arms and deliver themselves from the slavery
which weighed so heavily upon them; declaring that the complaints of the
discontented in the city, rather than their own grievances, had induced
them to attempt their deliverance. They had heard that many prayed to
God for an opportunity of avenging themselves, and vowed they would
use it whenever they found anyone to conduct them; but now, when the
favorable circumstances occurred, and they found those who were ready to
lead them, they stared at each other like men stupefied, and would wait
till those who were endeavoring to recover for them their liberty
were slain, and their own chains more strongly riveted upon them; they
wondered that those who were wont to take arms upon slight occasions,
remained unmoved under the pressure of so many and so great evils; and
that they could willingly suffer such numbers of their fellow-citizens
to be banished, so many admonished, when it was in their power to
restore the banished to their country, and the admonished to the honors
of the state. These words, although full of truth, produced no effect
upon those to whom they were addressed; for they were either restrained
by their fears, or, on account of the two murders which had been
committed, disgusted with the parties. Thus the movers of the tumult,
finding that neither words or deeds had force sufficient to stir anyone,
saw, when too late, how dangerous a thing it is to attempt to set a
people free who are resolved to be slaves; and, despairing of success,
they withdrew to the temple of Santa Reparata, where, not to save their
lives, but to defer the moment of their deaths, they shut themselves up.
Upon the first rumor of the affair, the Signory being in fear, armed and
secured the palace; but when the facts of the case were understood,
the parties known, and whither they had betaken themselves, their fears
subsided, and they sent the Capitano with a sufficient body of armed
men to secure them. The gates of the temple were forced without much
trouble; part of the conspirators were slain defending themselves;
the remainder were made prisoners and examined, but none were found
implicated in the affair except Baroccio and Piggiello Cavicciulli, who
were put to death with them.

Shortly after this event, another occurred of greater importance. The
Florentines were, as we have before remarked, at war with the duke of
Milan, who, finding that with merely open force he could not overcome
them, had recourse to secret practices, and with the assistance of the
exiles of whom Lombardy was full, he formed a plot to which many in the
city were accessory. It was resolved by the conspirators that most of
the emigrants, capable of bearing arms, should set out from the places
nearest Florence, enter the city by the river Arno, and with their
friends hasten to the residences of the chiefs of the government; and
having slain them, reform the republic according to their own will. Of
the conspirators within the city, was one of the Ricci named Samminiato;
and as it often happens in treacherous practices, few are insufficient
to effect the purpose of the plot, and among many secrecy cannot be
preserved, so while Samminiato was in quest of associates, he found an
accuser. He confided the affair to Salvestro Cavicciulli, whose wrongs
and those of his friends were thought sufficient to make him faithful;
but he, more influenced by immediate fear than the hope of future
vengeance, discovered the whole affair to the Signory, who, having
caused Samminiato to be taken, compelled him to tell all the particulars
of the matter. However, none of the conspirators were taken, except
Tommaso Davizi, who, coming from Bologna, and unaware of what had
occurred at Florence, was seized immediately upon his arrival. All the
others had fled immediately upon the apprehension of Samminiato.

Samminiato and Tommaso having been punished according to their deserts,
a Balia was formed of many citizens, which sought the delinquents, and
took measures for the security of the state. They declared six of the
family of the Ricci rebels; also, six of the Alberti; two of the Medici;
three of the Scali; two of the Strozzi; Bindo Altoviti, Bernado Adimari,
and many others of inferior quality. They admonished all the family
of the Alberti, the Ricci, and the Medici for ten years, except a few
individuals. Among the Alberti, not admonished, was Antonio, who was
thought to be quiet and peaceable. It happened, however, before all
suspicion of the conspiracy had ceased, a monk was taken who had been
observed during its progress to pass frequently between Bologna and
Florence. He confessed that he had often carried letters to Antonio,
who was immediately seized, and, though he denied all knowledge of the
matter from the first, the monk's accusation prevailed, and he was fined
in a considerable sum of money, and banished a distance of three hundred
miles from Florence. That the Alberti might not constantly place the
city in jeopardy, every member of the family was banished whose age
exceeded fifteen years.

These events took place in the year 1400, and two years afterward, died
Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, whose death as we have said above, put
an end to the war, which had then continued twelve years. At this time,
the government having gained greater strength, and being without
enemies external or internal, undertook the conquest of Pisa, and having
gloriously completed it, the peace of the city remained undisturbed
from 1400 to 1433, except that in 1412, the Alberti, having crossed the
boundary they were forbidden to pass, a Balia was formed which with new
provisions fortified the state and punished the offenders with heavy
fines. During this period also, the Florentines made war with Ladislaus,
king of Naples, who finding himself in great danger ceded to them the
city of Cortona of which he was master; but soon afterward, recovering
his power, he renewed the war, which became far more disastrous to the
Florentines than before; and had it not, in 1414, been terminated by his
death, as that of Lombardy had been by the death of the duke of Milan,
he, like the duke, would have brought Florence into great danger of
losing her liberty. Nor was the war with the king concluded with less
good fortune than the former; for when he had taken Rome, Sienna, the
whole of La Marca and Romagna, and had only Florence itself to vanquish,
he died. Thus death has always been more favorable to the Florentines
than any other friend, and more potent to save them than their own
valor. From the time of the king's decease, peace was preserved both at
home and abroad for eight years, at the end of which, with the wars of
Filippo, duke of Milan, the spirit of faction again broke out, and was
only appeased by the ruin of that government which continued from 1381
to 1434, had conducted with great glory so many enterprises; acquired
Arezzo, Pisa, Cortona, Leghorn, and Monte Pulciano; and would have
accomplished more if the citizens had lived in unity, and had not
revived former factions; as in the following book will be particularly
shown.

CHAPTER I

License and Slavery peculiar defects in republican
governments--Application of this reflection to the state of
Florence--Giovanni di Bicci di' Medici re-establishes the authority of
his family--Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, endeavors to make amicable
arrangements with the Florentines--Their jealousy of him--Precautionary

Republican governments, more especially those imperfectly organized,
frequently change their rulers and the form of their institutions; not
by the influence of liberty or subjection, as many suppose, but by
that of slavery and license; for with the nobility or the people, the
ministers respectively of slavery or licentiousness, only the name of
liberty is in any estimation, neither of them choosing to be subject
either to magistrates or laws. When, however, a good, wise, and powerful
citizen appears (which is but seldom), who establishes ordinances
capable of appeasing or restraining these contending dispositions, so as
to prevent them from doing mischief, then the government may be called
free, and its institutions firm and secure; for having good laws for its
basis, and good regulations for carrying them into effect, it needs
not, like others, the virtue of one man for its maintenance. With such
excellent laws and institutions, many of those ancient republics, which
were of long duration, were endowed. But these advantages are, and
always have been, denied to those which frequently change from tyranny
to license, or the reverse; because, from the powerful enemies which
each condition creates itself, they neither have, nor can possess any
stability; for tyranny cannot please the good, and license is offensive
to the wise: the former may easily be productive of mischief, while the
latter can scarcely be beneficial; in the former, the insolent have too
much authority, and in the latter, the foolish; so that each requires
for their welfare the virtue and the good fortune of some individual who
may be removed by death, or become unserviceable by misfortune.

Hence, it appears, that the government which commenced in Florence at
the death of Giorgio Scali, in 1381, was first sustained by the talents
of Maso degli Albizzi, and then by those of Niccolo da Uzzano. The city
remained tranquil from 1414 to 1422; for King Ladislaus was dead, and
Lombardy divided into several parts; so that there was nothing either
internal or external to occasion uneasiness. Next to Niccolo da Uzzano
in authority, were Bartolomeo Valori, Neroni di Nigi, Rinaldo degli
Albizzi, Neri di Gino, and Lapo Niccolini. The factions that arose from
the quarrels of the Albizzi and the Ricci, and which were afterward so
unhappily revived by Salvestro de' Medici, were never extinguished; for
though the party most favored by the rabble only continued three
years, and in 1381 was put down, still, as it comprehended the greatest
numerical proportion, it was never entirely extinct, though the frequent
Balias and persecutions of its leaders from 1381 to 1400, reduced it
almost to nothing. The first families that suffered in this way were the
Alberti, the Ricci, and the Medici, which were frequently deprived both
of men and money; and if any of them remained in the city, they were
deprived of the honors of government. These oft-repeated acts of
oppression humiliated the faction, and almost annihilated it. Still,
many retained the remembrance of the injuries they had received, and
a desire of vengeance remained pent in their bosoms, ungratified and
unquenched. Those nobles of the people, or new nobility, who peaceably
governed the city, committed two errors, which eventually caused the
ruin of their party; the first was, that by long continuance in power
they became insolent; the second, that the envy they entertained toward
each other, and their uninterrupted possession of power, destroyed that
vigilance over those who might injure them, which they ought to have
exercised. Thus daily renewing the hatred of a mass of the people by
their sinister proceedings, and either negligent of the threatened
dangers, because rendered fearless by prosperity, or encouraging them
through mutual envy, they gave an opportunity to the family of the
Medici to recover their influence. The first to do so was Giovanni di
Bicci de' Medici, who having become one of the richest men, and being of
a humane and benevolent disposition, obtained the supreme magistracy
by the consent of those in power. This circumstance gave so much
gratification to the mass of the people (the multitude thinking they had
now found a defender), that not without occasion the judicious of the
party observed it with jealousy, for they perceived all the former
feelings of the city revived. Niccolo da Uzzano did not fail to acquaint
the other citizens with the matter, explaining to them how dangerous it
was to aggrandize one who possessed so much influence; that it was easy
to remedy an evil at its commencement, but exceedingly difficult after
having allowed it to gather strength; and that Giovanni possessed
several qualities far surpassing those of Salvestro. The associates of
Niccolo were uninfluenced by his remarks; for they were jealous of his
reputation, and desired to exalt some person, by means of whom he might
be humbled.

This was the state of Florence, in which opposing feelings began to
be observable, when Filippo Visconti, second son of Giovanni Galeazzo,
having, by the death of his brother, become master of all Lombardy, and
thinking he might undertake almost anything, greatly desired to recover
Genoa, which enjoyed freedom under the Dogiate of Tommaso da Campo
Fregoso. He did not think it advisable to attempt this, or any other
enterprise, till he had renewed amicable relations with the Florentines,
and made his good understanding with them known; but with the aid of
their reputation he trusted he should attain his wishes. He therefore
sent ambassadors to Florence to signify his desires. Many citizens were
opposed to his design, but did not wish to interrupt the peace with
Milan, which had now continued for many years. They were fully aware of
the advantages he would derive from a war with Genoa, and the little use
it would be to Florence. Many others were inclined to accede to it, but
would set a limit to his proceedings, which, if he were to exceed, all
would perceive his base design, and thus they might, when the treaty was
broken, more justifiably make war against him. The question having been
strongly debated, an amicable arrangement was at length effected, by
which Filippo engaged not to interfere with anything on the Florentine
side of the rivers Magra and Panaro.

Soon after the treaty was concluded, the duke took possession of
Brescia, and shortly afterward of Genoa, contrary to the expectation
of those who had advocated peace; for they thought Brescia would be
defended by the Venetians, and Genoa would be able to defend herself.
And as in the treaty which Filippo made with the Doge of Genoa, he had
acquired Serezana and other places situated on this side the Magra, upon
condition that, if he wished to alienate them, they should be given to
the Genoese, it was quite palpable that he had broken the treaty; and he
had, besides, entered into another treaty with the legate of Bologna,
in opposition to his engagement respecting the Panaro. These things
disturbed the minds of the citizens, and made them, apprehensive of new
troubles, consider the means to be adopted for their defense.

The dissatisfaction of the Florentines coming to the knowledge of
Filippo, he, either to justify himself, or to become acquainted with
their prevailing feelings, or to lull them to repose, sent ambassadors
to the city, to intimate that he was greatly surprised at the suspicions
they entertained, and offered to revoke whatever he had done that could
be thought a ground of jealousy. This embassy produced no other
effect than that of dividing the citizens; one party, that in greatest
reputation, judged it best to arm, and prepare to frustrate the enemy's
designs; and if he were to remain quiet, it would not be necessary to go
to war with him, but an endeavor might be made to preserve peace. Many
others, whether envious of those in power, or fearing a rupture with the
duke, considered it unadvisable so lightly to entertain suspicions of
an ally, and thought his proceedings need not have excited so much
distrust; that appointing the ten and hiring forces was in itself a
manifest declaration of war, which, if undertaken against so great a
prince, would bring certain ruin upon the city without the hope of any
advantage; for possession could never be retained of the conquests that
might be made, because Romagna lay between, and the vicinity of the
church ought to prevent any attempt against Romagna itself. However the
views of those who were in favor of war prevailed, the Council of Ten
were appointed, forces were hired, and new taxes levied, which, as they
were more burdensome upon the lower than the upper ranks, filled the
city with complaints, and all condemned the ambition and avarice of the
great, declaring that, to gratify themselves and oppress the people,
they would go to war without any justifiable motive.

They had not yet come to an open rupture with the duke, but everything
tended to excite suspicion; for Filippo had, at the request of the
legate of Bologna (who was in fear of Antonio Bentivogli, an emigrant
of Bologna at Castel Bolognese), sent forces to that city, which,
being close upon the Florentine territory, filled the citizens with
apprehension; but what gave every one greater alarm, and offered
sufficient occasion for the declaration of war, was the expedition made
by the duke against Furli. Giorgio Ordelaffi was lord of Furli, who
dying, left Tibaldo, his son, under the guardianship of Filippo. The
boy's mother, suspicious of his guardian, sent him to Lodovico Alidossi,
her father, who was lord of Imola, but she was compelled by the people
of Furli to obey the will of her deceased husband, to withdraw him from
the natural guardian, and place him in the hands of the duke. Upon
this Filippo, the better to conceal his purpose, caused the Marquis of
Ferrara to send Guido Torello as his agent, with forces, to seize the
government of Furli, and thus the territory fell into the duke's hands.
When this was known at Florence, together with the arrival of forces at
Bologna, the arguments in favor of war were greatly strengthened, but
there were still many opposed to it, and among the rest Giovanni de'
Medici, who publicly endeavored to show, that even if the ill designs of
the duke were perfectly manifest, it would still be better to wait and
let him commence the attack, than to assail him; for in the former case
they would be justified in the view of the princes of Italy as well as
in their own; but if they were to strike the first blow at the duke,
public opinion would be as favorable to him as to themselves; and
besides, they could not so confidently demand assistance as assailants,
as they might do if assailed; and that men always defend themselves more
vigorously when they attack others. The advocates of war considered it
improper to await the enemy in their houses, and better to go and seek
him; that fortune is always more favorable to assailants than to such
as merely act on the defensive, and that it is less injurious, even when
attended with greater immediate expense, to make war at another's door
than at our own. These views prevailed, and it was resolved that the ten
should provide all the means in their power for rescuing Furli from the
hands of the duke.

Filippo, finding the Florentines resolved to occupy the places he had
undertaken to defend, postponed all personal considerations, and sent
Agnolo della Pergola with a strong force against Imola, that Ludovico,
having to provide for the defense of his own possessions, might be
unable to protect the interests of his grandson. Agnolo approached Imola
while the forces of the Florentines were at Modigliana, and an intense
frost having rendered the ditches of the city passable, he crossed them
during the night, captured the place, and sent Lodovico a prisoner to
Milan. The Florentines finding Imola in the hands of the enemy, and the
war publicly known, sent their forces to Furli and besieged it on all
sides. That the duke's people might not relieve it, they hired Count
Alberigo, who from Zagonara, his own domain, overran the country daily,
up to the gates of Imola. Agnolo della Pergola, finding the strong
position which the Florentines had taken prevented him from relieving
Furli, determined to attempt the capture of Zagonara, thinking they
would not allow that place to be lost, and that in the endeavor to
relieve it they would be compelled to give up their design against
Furli, and come to an engagement under great disadvantage. Thus the
duke's people compelled Alberigo to sue for terms, which he obtained on
condition of giving up Zagonara, if the Florentines did not relieve him
within fifteen days. This misfortune being known in the Florentine camp
and in the city, and all being anxious that the enemy should not obtain
the expected advantage, they enabled him to secure a greater; for
having abandoned the siege of Furli to go to the relief of Zagonara, on
encountering the enemy they were soon routed, not so much by the bravery
of their adversaries as by the severity of the season; for, having
marched many hours through deep mud and heavy rain, they found the enemy
quite fresh, and were therefore easily vanquished. Nevertheless, in
this great defeat, famous throughout all Italy, no death occurred except
those of Lodovico degli Obizi and two of his people, who having fallen
from their horses were drowned in the morass.



CHAPTER II

The Florentines murmur against those who had been advocates of the
war--Rinaldo degli Albizzi encourages the citizens--Measures for the
prosecution of the war--Attempt of the higher classes to deprive the
plebeians of their share in the government--Rinaldo degli Albizzi
addresses an assembly of citizens and advises the restoration of the
_Grandi_--Niccolo da Uzzano wishes to have Giovanni de' Medici on their
side--Giovanni disapproves of the advice of Rinaldo degli Albizzi.

The defeat at Zagonara spread consternation throughout Florence; but
none felt it so severely as the nobility, who had been in favor of the
war; for they perceived their enemies to be inspirited and themselves
disarmed, without friends, and opposed by the people, who at the corners
of streets insulted them with sarcastic expressions, complaining of the
heavy taxes, and the unnecessary war, and saying, "Oh! they appointed
the ten to frighten the enemy. Have they relieved Furli, and rescued her
from the hands of the duke? No! but their designs have been discovered;
and what had they in view? not the defense of liberty; for they do not
love her; but to aggrandize their own power, which God has very justly
abated. This is not the only enterprise by many a one with which they
have oppressed the city; for the war against King Ladislaus was of a
similar kind. To whom will they flee for assistance now? to Pope Martin,
whom they ridiculed before the face of Braccio; or to Queen Giovanna,
whom they abandoned, and compelled to throw herself under the protection
of the king of Aragon?" To these reproaches was added all that might be
expected from an enraged multitude.

Seeing the discontent so prevalent, the Signory resolved to assemble
a few citizens, and with soft words endeavor to soothe the popular
irritation. On this occasion, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, the eldest son of
Maso, who, by his own talents and the respect he derived from the memory
of his father, aspired to the first offices in the government, spoke at
great length; showing that it is not right to judge of actions merely
by their effects; for it often happens that what has been very maturely
considered is attended with unfavorable results: that if we are to
applaud evil counsels because they are sometimes followed by fortunate
events, we should only encourage men in error which would bring great
mischief upon the republic; because evil counsel is not always attended
with happy consequences. In the same way, it would be wrong to blame
a wise resolution, because if its being attended with an unfavorable
issue; for by so doing, we should destroy the inclination of citizens
to offer advice and speak the truth. He then showed the propriety
of undertaking the war; and that if it had not been commenced by the
Florentines in Romagna the duke would have assailed them in Tuscany. But
since it had pleased God, that the Florentine people should be overcome,
their loss would be still greater if they allowed themselves to be
dejected; but if they set a bold front against adversity, and made good
use of the means within their power, they would not be sensible of their
loss or the duke of his victory. He assured them they ought not to
be alarmed by impending expenses and consequent taxation; because the
latter might be reduced, and the future expense would not be so great as
the former had been; for less preparation is necessary for those engaged
in self-defense than for those who design to attack others. He advised
them to imitate the conduct of their forefathers, who, by courageous
conduct in adverse circumstances, had defended themselves against all
their enemies.

Thus encouraged, the citizens engaged Count Oddo the son of Braccio,
and united with him, for directing the operations of the war, Niccolo
Piccinino, a pupil of his father's, and one of the most celebrated of
all who had served under him. To these they added other leaders, and
remounted some of those who had lost their horses in the late defeat.
They also appointed twenty citizens to levy new taxes, who finding the
great quite subdued by the recent loss, took courage and drained them
without mercy.

These burdens were very grievous to the nobility, who at first, in order
to conciliate, did not complain of their own particular hardships, but
censured the tax generally as unjust, and advised that something should
be done in the way of relief; but their advice was rejected in the
Councils. Therefore, to render the law as offensive as possible, and to
make all sensible of its injustice, they contrived that the taxes should
be levied with the utmost rigor, and made it lawful to kill any that
might resist the officers employed to collect them. Hence followed many
lamentable collisions, attended with the blood and death of citizens. It
began to be the impression of all, that arms would be resorted to, and
all prudent persons apprehended some approaching evil; for the higher
ranks, accustomed to be treated with respect, could not endure to be
used like dogs; and the rest were desirous that the taxation should be
equalized. In consequence of this state of things, many of the first
citizens met together, and it was resolved that it had become necessary
for their safety, that some attempt should be made to recover the
government; since their want of vigilance had encouraged men to censure
public actions, and allowed those to interfere in affairs who had
hitherto been merely the leaders of the rabble. Having repeatedly
discussed the subject, they resolved to meet again at an appointed hour,
when upwards of seventy citizens assembled in the church of St. Stephen,
with the permission of Lorenzo Ridolfi and Francesco Gianfigliazzi, both
members of the Signory. Giovanni de' Medici was not among them either
because being under suspicion he was not invited or that entertaining
different views he was unwilling to interfere.

Rinaldo degli Albizzi addressed the assembly, describing the condition
of the city, and showing how by their own negligence it had again fallen
under the power of the plebeians, from whom it had been wrested by their
fathers in 1381. He reminded them of the iniquity of the government
which was in power from 1378 to 1381, and that all who were then present
had to lament, some a father, others a grandfather, put to death by its
tyranny. He assured them they were now in the same danger, and that the
city was sinking under the same disorders. The multitude had already
imposed a tax of its own authority; and would soon, if not restrained
by greater force or better regulations, appoint the magistrates, who, in
this case, would occupy their places, and overturn the government which
for forty-two years had ruled the city with so much glory; the citizens
would then be subject to the will of the multitude, and live disorderly
and dangerous, or be under the command of some individual who might make
himself prince. For these reasons he was of opinion, that whoever loved
his country and his honor must arouse himself, and call to mind the
virtue of Bardo Mancini, who, by the ruin of the Alberti, rescued the
city from the dangers then impending; and that the cause of the audacity
now assumed by the multitude was the extensive Squittini or Pollings,
which, by their negligence, were allowed to be made; for thus the palace
had become filled with low men. He therefore concluded, that the
only means of remedying the evil was to restore the government to the
nobility, and diminish the authority of the minor trades by reducing the
companies from fourteen to seven, which would give the plebeians less
authority in the Councils, both by the reduction in their number and
by increasing the authority of the great; who, on account of former
enmities, would be disinclined to favor them. He added, that it is
a good thing to know how to avail themselves of men according to the
times; and that as their fathers had used the plebeians to reduce the
influence of the great, that now, the great having been humbled, and the
plebeians become insolent, it was well to restrain the insolence of
the latter by the assistance of the former. To effect this they might
proceed either openly or otherwise, for some of them belonging to the
Council of Ten, forces might be led into the city without exciting
observation.

Rinaldo was much applauded, and his advice was approved of by the whole
assembly. Niccolo da Uzzano who, among others, replied to it, said, "All
that Rinaldo had advanced was correct, and the remedies he proposed good
and certain, if they could be adopted without an absolute division
of the city; and this he had no doubt would be effected if they could
induce Giovanni de' Medici to join them; for with him on their side,
the multitude being deprived of their chief and stay, would be unable
to oppose them; but that if he did not concur with them they could do
nothing without arms, and that with them they would incur the risk of
being vanquished, or of not being able to reap the fruit of victory." He
then modestly reminded them of what he had said upon a former occasion,
and of their reluctance to remedy the evil when it might easily have
been done; that now the same remedy could not be attempted without
incurring the danger of greater evils, and therefore there was nothing
left for them to do but to gain him over to their side, if practicable.
Rinaldo was then commissioned to wait upon Giovanni and try if he could
induce him to join them.

He undertook this commission, and in the most prevailing words he could
make use of endeavored to induce him to coincide with their views; and
begged that he would not by favoring an audacious mob, enable them to
complete the ruin both of the government and the city. To this Giovanni
replied, that he considered it the duty of a good and wise citizen to
avoid altering the institutions to which a city is accustomed; there
being nothing so injurious to the people as such a change; for many are
necessarily offended, and where there are several discontented, some
unpropitious event may be constantly apprehended. He said it appeared to
him that their resolution would have two exceedingly pernicious effects;
the one conferring honors on those who, having never possessed them,
esteemed them the less, and therefore had the less occasion to grieve
for their absence; the other taking them from those who being accustomed
to their possession would never be at rest till they were restored to
them. It would thus be evident that the injury done to one party, was
greater than the benefit they had conferred upon the other; so that
whoever was the author of the proposition, he would gain few friends and
make many enemies, and that the latter would be more resolutely bent
on injuring him than the former would be zealous for his defense, for
mankind are naturally more disposed to revenge than to gratitude, as
if the latter could only be exercised with some inconvenience to
themselves, while the former brings alike gratification and profit.
Then, directing his discourse more particularly to Rinaldo, he said,
"And you, if you could call to mind past events, and knew how craftily
affairs are conducted in this city, would not be so eager in this
pursuit; for he who advises it, when by your aid he has wrested the
power from the people, will, with the people's assistance, who will have
become your enemies, deprive you of it. And it will happen to you as
to Benedetto Alberti, who, at the persuasion of those who were not his
friends, consented to the ruin of Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and
shortly afterward was himself sent into exile by the very same men." He
therefore advised Rinaldo to think more maturely of these things, and
endeavor to imitate his father, who, to obtain the benevolence of all,
reduced the price of salt, provided that whoever owed taxes under half
a florin should be at liberty to pay them or not, as he thought proper,
and that at the meeting of the Councils every one should be free from
the importunities of his creditors. He concluded by saying, that as
regarded himself, he was disposed to let the government of the city
remain as it was.



CHAPTER III

Giovanni de' Medici acquires the favor of the people--Bravery of Biaggio
del Melano--Baseness of Zanobi del Pino--The Florentines obtain the
friendship of the lord of Faenza--League of the Florentines with the
Venetians--Origin of the Catasto--The rich citizens discontented with
it--Peace with the duke of Milan--New disturbances on account of the
Catasto.

These events, and the circumstances attending them, becoming known to
the people, contributed greatly to increase the reputation of Giovanni,
and brought odium on those who had made the proposals; but he assumed an
appearance of indifference, in order to give less encouragement to
those who by his influence were desirous of change. In his discourse he
intimated to every one that it is not desirable to promote factions, but
rather to extinguish them; and that whatever might be expected of him,
he only sought the union of the city. This, however, gave offense to
many of his party; for they would have rather seen him exhibit greater
activity. Among others so disposed, was Alamanno de' Medici, who being
of a restless disposition, never ceased exciting him to persecute
enemies and favor friends; condemning his coldness and slow method
of proceeding, which he said was the cause of his enemies' practicing
against him, and that these practices would one day effect the ruin of
himself and his friends. He endeavored to excite Cosmo, his son, with
similar discourses; but Giovanni, for all that was either disclosed or
foretold him, remained unmoved, although parties were now declared, and
the city in manifest disunion.

There were at the palace, in the service of the Signory, two
chancellors, Ser Martino and Ser Pagolo. The latter favored the party
of Niccolo da Uzzano, the former that of Giovanni; and Rinaldo, seeing
Giovanni unwilling to join them, thought it would be advisable to
deprive Ser Martino of his office, that he might have the palace
more completely under his control. The design becoming known to his
adversaries, Ser Martino was retained and Ser Pagolo discharged, to the
great injury and displeasure of Rinaldo and his party. This circumstance
would soon have produced most mischievous effects, but for the war
with which the city was threatened, and the recent defeat suffered at
Zagonara, which served to check the audacity of the people; for while
these events were in progress at Florence, Agnolo della Pergola, with
the forces of the duke, had taken all the towns and cities possessed
by the Florentines in Romagna, except Castracaro and Modigliano; partly
from the weakness of the places themselves, and partly by the misconduct
of those who had the command of them. In the course of the campaign, two
instances occurred which served to show how greatly courage is admired
even in enemies, and how much cowardice and pusillanimity are despised.

Biaggio del Melano was castellan in the fortress of Monte Petroso. Being
surrounded by enemies, and seeing no chance of saving the place, which
was already in flames, he cast clothes and straw from a part which was
not yet on fire, and upon these he threw his two little children, saying
to the enemy, "Take to yourselves those goods which fortune has bestowed
upon me, and of which you may deprive me; but those of the mind, in
which my honor and glory consist, I will not give up, neither can you
wrest them from me." The besiegers ran to save the children, and placed
for their father ropes and ladders, by which to save himself, but he
would not use them, and rather chose to die in the flames than owe his
safety to the enemies of his country: an example worthy of that much
lauded antiquity, which offers nothing to surpass it, and which we
admire the more from the rarity of any similar occurrence. Whatever
could be recovered from the ruins, was restored for the use of the
children, and carefully conveyed to their friends; nor was the republic
less grateful; for as long as they lived, they were supported at her
charge.

An example of an opposite character occurred at Galeata, where Zanobi
del Pino was governor; he, without offering the least resistance, gave
up the fortress to the enemy; and besides this, advised Agnolo della
Pergola to leave the Alps of Romagna, and come among the smaller hills
of Tuscany, where he might carry on the war with less danger and greater
advantage. Agnolo could not endure the mean and base spirit of this man,
and delivered him to his own attendants, who, after many reproaches,
gave him nothing to eat but paper painted with snakes, saying, that of a
Guelph they would make him a Ghibelline; and thus fasting, he died in a
few days.

At this time Count Oddo and Niccolo Piccinino entered the Val di Lamona,
with the design of bringing the lord of Faenza over to the Florentines,
or at least inducing him to restrain the incursions of Agnolo della
Pergola into Romagna; but as this valley is naturally strong, and its
inhabitants warlike, Count Oddo was slain there, and Niccolo Piccinino
sent a prisoner to Faenza. Fortune, however, caused the Florentines to
obtain by their loss, what, perhaps, they would have failed to acquire
by victory; for Niccolo so prevailed with the lord of Faenza and his
mother, that they became friends of the Florentines. By this treaty,
Niccolo Piccinino was set at liberty, but did not take the advice he had
given others; for while in treaty with the city, concerning the terms of
his engagement, either the conditions proposed were insufficient, or he
found better elsewhere; for quite suddenly he left Arezzo, where he had
been staying, passed into Lombardy, and entered the service of the duke.

The Florentines, alarmed by this circumstance, and reduced to
despondency by their frequent losses, thought themselves unable to
sustain the war alone, and sent ambassadors to the Venetians, to beg
they would lend their aid to oppose the greatness of one who, if allowed
to aggrandize himself, would soon become as dangerous to them as to the
Florentines themselves. The Venetians were advised to adopt the same
course by Francesco Carmignuola, one of the most distinguished warriors
of those times, who had been in the service of the duke, and had
afterward quitted it; but they hesitated, not knowing how far to trust
him; for they thought his enmity with the duke was only feigned. While
in this suspense, it was found that the duke, by means of a servant
of Carmignuola, had caused poison to be given him in his food, which,
although it was not fatal, reduced him to extremity. The truth being
discovered, the Venetians laid aside their suspicion; and as the
Florentines still solicited their assistance, a treaty was formed
between the two powers, by which they agreed to carry on the war at the
common expense of both: the conquests in Lombardy to be assigned to
the Venetians; those in Romagna and Tuscany to the Florentines; and
Carmignuola was appointed Captain General of the League. By this treaty
the war was commenced in Lombardy, where it was admirably conducted; for
in a few months many places were taken from the duke, together with the
city of Brescia, the capture of which was in those days considered a
most brilliant exploit.

The war had continued from 1422 to 1427, and the citizens of Florence
were so wearied of the taxes that had been imposed during that time,
that it was resolved to revise them, preparatory to their amelioration.
That they might be equalized according to the means of each citizen, it
was proposed that whoever possessed property of the value of one hundred
florins should pay half a florin of taxes. Individual contribution would
thus be determined by an invariable rule, and not left to the discretion
of parties; and as it was found that the new method would press heavily
upon the powerful classes, they used their utmost endeavors to prevent
it from becoming law. Giovanni de' Medici alone declared himself in
favor of it, and by his means it was passed. In order to determine the
amount each had to pay, it was necessary to consider his property in the
aggregate, which the Florentines call _accatastare_, in which in this
application of it would signify TO RATE or VALUE, and hence this tax
received the name of _catasto_. The new method of rating formed a
powerful check to the tyranny of the great, who could no longer oppress
the lower classes, or silence them with threats in the council as they
had formerly done, and it therefore gave general satisfaction, though to
the wealthy classes it was in the highest degree offensive. But as it is
found men are never satisfied, but that the possession of one advantage
only makes them desire more, the people, not content with the equality
of taxation which the new law produced, demanded that the same rule
should be applied to past years; that in investigation should be made
to determine how much, according to the Catasto, the rich had paid less
than their share, and that they should now pay up to an equality with
those who, in order to meet the demand unjustly made, had been compelled
to sell their possessions. This proposal alarmed the great more than
the Catasto had done; and in self-defense they unceasingly decried it,
declaring it in the highest degree unjust in being laid not only on
immovable but movable property, which people possess to-day and lose
to-morrow; that many persons have hidden wealth which the Catasto cannot
reach; that those who leave their own affairs to manage those of the
republic should be less burdened by her, it being enough for them to
give their labour, and that it was unjust of the city to take both
their property and their time, while of others she only took money. The
advocates of the Catasto replied, that if movable property varies, the
taxes would also vary, and frequently rating it would remedy the evil
to which it was subject; that it was unnecessary to mention those who
possessed hidden property; for it would be unreasonable to take taxes
for that which produced no interest, and that if it paid anything, it
could not fail to be discovered: that those who did not like to labor
for the republic might cease to do so; for no doubt she would find
plenty of loving citizens who would take pleasure in assisting her
with both money and counsel: that the advantages and honors of a
participation in the government are so great, that of themselves they
are a sufficient remuneration to those who thus employ themselves,
without wishing to be excused from paying their share of taxes. But,
they added, the real grievance had not been mentioned: for those who
were offended with the Catasto, regretted they could no longer involve
the city in all the difficulties of war without injury to themselves,
now that they had to contribute like the rest; and that if this law had
then been in force they would not have gone to war with King Ladislaus,
or the Duke Filippo, both which enterprises had been not through
necessity, but to impoverish the citizens. The excitement was appeased
by Giovanni de' Medici, who said, "It is not well to go into things so
long past, unless to learn something for our present guidance; and if in
former times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that
we have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that
this will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them;
which would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of
taxes for the past, and make them equal to the present; and that he who
is content with a moderate victory is always most successful; for those
who would more than conquer, commonly lose." With such words as these
he calmed the disturbance, and this retrospective equalization was no
longer contemplated.

The war with the duke still continued; but peace was at length restored
by means of a legate of the pope. The duke, however, from the first
disregarded the conditions, so that the league again took arms, and
meeting the enemy's forces at Maclovio routed them. After this defeat
the duke again made proposals for peace, to which the Florentines
and Venetians both agreed; the former from jealousy of the Venetians,
thinking they had spent quite enough money in the aggrandizement of
others; the latter, because they found Carmignuola, after the defeat of
the duke, proceed but coldly in their cause; so that they thought it no
longer safe to trust him. A treaty was therefore concluded in 1428, by
which the Florentines recovered the places they had lost in Romagna;
and the Venetians kept Brescia, to which the duke added Bergamo and the
country around it. In this war the Florentines expended three millions
and a half of ducats, extended the territory and power of the Venetians,
and brought poverty and disunion upon themselves.

Being at peace with their neighbors, domestic troubles recommenced. The
great citizens could not endure the Catasto, and not knowing how to
set it aside, they endeavored to raise up more numerous enemies to
the measure, and thus provide themselves with allies to assist them in
annulling it. They therefore instructed the officers appointed to levy
the tax, that the law required them to extend the Catasto over the
property of their nearest neighbors, to see if Florentine wealth was
concealed among it. The dependent states were therefore ordered to
present a schedule of their property against a certain time. This was
extremely offensive to the people of Volterra, who sent to the Signory
to complain of it; but the officers, in great wrath, committed eighteen
of the complainants to prison. The Volterrani, however, out of regard
for their fellow-countrymen who were arrested, did not proceed to any
violence.



CHAPTER IV

Death of Giovanni de' Medici--His character--Insurrection of
Volterra--Volterra returns to her allegiance--Niccolo Fortebraccio
attacks the Lucchese--Diversity of opinion about the Lucchese
war--War with Lucca--Astore Gianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi appointed
commissaries--Violence of Astorre Gianni.

About this time Giovanni de' Medici was taken ill, and finding his end
approach, called his sons Cosmo and Lorenzo to him, to give them his
last advice, and said, "I find I have nearly reached the term which
God and nature appointed at my birth, and I die content, knowing that
I leave you rich, healthy, and of such standing in society, that if you
pursue the same course that I have, you will live respected in Florence,
and in favor with everyone. Nothing cheers me so much at this moment, as
the recollection that I have never willfully offended anyone; but have
always used my utmost endeavors to confer benefits upon all. I would
have you do so too. With regard to state affairs, if you would live in
security, take just such a share as the laws and your countrymen think
proper to bestow, thus you will escape both danger and envy; for it
is not what is given to any individual, but what he has determined to
possess, that occasions odium. You will thus have a larger share than
those who endeavor to engross more than belongs to them; for they
thus usually lose their own, and before they lose it, live in constant
disquiet. By adopting this method, although among so many enemies, and
surrounded by so many conflicting interests, I have not only maintained
my reputation but increased my influence. If you pursue the same course,
you will be attended by the same good fortune; if otherwise, you may be
assured, your end will resemble that of those who in our own times have
brought ruin both upon themselves and their families." Soon after this
interview with his sons, Giovanni died, regretted by everyone, as his
many excellencies deserved. He was compassionate; not only bestowing
alms on those who asked them, but very frequently relieving the
necessities of the poor, without having been solicited so to do. He
loved all; praised the good, and pitied the infirmities of the wicked.
He never sought the honors of government; yet enjoyed them all; and
never went to the palace unless by request. He loved peace and shunned
war; relieved mankind in adversity, and assisted them in prosperity;
never applied the public money to his own uses, but contributed to the
public wealth. He was courteous in office; not a man of great eloquence,
but possessed of extraordinary prudence. His demeanor expressed
melancholy; but after a short time his conversation became pleasant and
facetious. He died exceedingly rich in money, but still more in good
fame and the best wishes of mankind; and the wealth and respect he left
behind him were not only preserved but increased by his son Cosmo.

The Volterran ambassadors grew weary of lying in prison, and to obtain
their liberty promised to comply with the commands of the Florentines.
Being set free and returned to their city, the time arrived for the new
Priors to enter upon office, and among those who were drawn, was one
named Giusto, a plebeian, but possessing great influence with his class,
and one of those who had been imprisoned at Florence. He, being inflamed
with hatred against the Florentines on account of his public as well as
personal injuries, was further stimulated by Giovanni di Contugi, a man
of noble family, and his colleague in office, to induce the people, by
the authority of the Priors and his own influence, to withdraw their
country from the power of the Florentines, and make himself prince.
Prompted by these motives, Giusto took arms, rode through the city,
seized the Capitano, who resided in it, on behalf of the Florentines,
and with the consent of the people, became lord of Volterra. This
circumstance greatly displeased the Florentines; but having just made
peace with the duke, and the treaty being yet uninfringed on either
side, they bethought themselves in a condition to recover the place;
and that the opportunity might not be lost, they immediately appointed
Rinaldo degli Albizzi and Palla Strozzi commissaries, and sent them upon
the expedition. In the meantime, Giusto, who expected the Florentines
would attack him, requested assistance of Lucca and Sienna. The latter
refused, alleging her alliance with Florence; and Pagolo Guinigi, to
regain the favor of the Florentines, which he imagined he had lost
in the war with the duke and by his friendship for Filippo, not only
refused assistance to Giusto, but sent his messenger prisoner to
Florence.

The commissaries, to come upon the Volterrani unawares, assembled their
cavalry, and having raised a good body of infantry in the Val d'Arno
Inferiore, and the country about Pisa, proceeded to Volterra. Although
attacked by the Florentines and abandoned by his neighbors, Giusto did
not yield to fear; but, trusting to the strength of the city and the
ruggedness of the country around it, prepared for his defense.

There lived at Volterra one Arcolano, brother of that Giovanni Contugi
who had persuaded Giusto to assume the command. He possessed influence
among the nobility, and having assembled a few of his most confidential
friends, he assured them that by this event, God had come to the relief
of their necessities; for if they would only take arms, deprive Giusto
of the Signory, and give up the city to the Florentines, they might be
sure of obtaining the principal offices, and the place would retain all
its ancient privileges. Having gained them over, they went to the
palace in which Giusto resided; and while part of them remained below,
Arcolano, with three others, proceeded to the chamber above, where
finding him with some citizens, they drew him aside, as if desirous
to communicate something of importance, and conversing on different
subjects, let him to the lower apartment, and fell upon him with their
swords. They, however, were not so quick as to prevent Giusto from
making use of his own weapon; for with it he seriously wounded two of
them; but being unable to resist so many, he was at last slain, and his
body thrown into the street. Arcolano and his party gave up the city
to the Florentine commissaries, who, being at hand with their forces,
immediately took possession; but the condition of Volterra was worse
than before; for among other things which operated to her disadvantage,
most of the adjoining countryside was separated from her, and she was
reduced to the rank of a vicariate.

Volterra having been lost and recovered almost at the same time, present
circumstances afforded nothing of sufficient importance to occasion a
new war, if ambition had not again provoked one. Niccolo Fortebraccio,
the son of a sister of Braccio da Perugia, had been in the service
of the Florentines during most of their wars with the duke. Upon the
restoration of peace he was discharged; but when the affair of
Volterra took place, being encamped with his people at Fucecchio, the
commissaries availed themselves both of himself and his forces. Some
thought that while Rinaldo conducted the expedition along with him, he
persuaded him, under one pretext or another, to attack the Lucchese,
assuring him, that if he did so, the Florentines would consent to
undertake an expedition against them, and would appoint him to the
command. When Volterra was recovered, and Niccolo returned to his
quarters at Fucecchio, he, either at the persuasion of Rinaldo, or of
his own accord, in November, 1429, took possession of Ruoti and Compito,
castles belonging to the Lucchese, with three hundred cavalry and
as many infantry, and then descending into the plain, plundered the
inhabitants to a vast amount. The news of this incursion having
reached Florence, persons of all classes were seen gathered in parties
throughout the city discussing the matter, and nearly all were in favor
of an expedition against Lucca. Of the Grandees thus disposed, were the
Medici and their party, and with them also Rinaldo, either because he
thought the enterprise beneficial to the republic, or induced by his own
ambition and the expectation of being appointed to the command. Niccolo
da Uzzano and his party were opposed to the war. It seems hardly
credible that such contrary opinions should prevail, though at different
times, in the same men and the same city, upon the subject of war; for
the same citizens and people that, during the ten years of peace had
incessantly blamed the war undertaken against Duke Filippo, in defense
of liberty, now, after so much expense and trouble, with their utmost
energy, insisted on hostilities against Lucca, which, if successful,
would deprive that city of her liberty; while those who had been in
favor of a war with the duke, were opposed to the present; so much
more ready are the multitude to covet the possessions of others than to
preserve their own, and so much more easily are they led by the hope
of acquisition than by the fear of loss. The suggestions of the latter
appear incredible till they are verified; and the pleasing anticipations
of the former are cherished as facts, even while the advantages are very
problematical, or at best, remote. The people of Florence were inspired
with hope, by the acquisitions which Niccolo Fortebraccio had made, and
by letters received from their rectors in the vicinity of Lucca; for
their deputies at Vico and Pescia had written, that if permission were
given to them to receive the castles that offered to surrender, the
whole country of Lucca would very soon be obtained. It must, however, be
added, that an ambassador was sent by the governor of Lucca to Florence,
to complain of the attack made by Niccolo, and to entreat that the
Signory would not make war against a neighbor, and a city that had
always been friendly to them. The ambassador was Jacopo Viviani, who, a
short time previously, had been imprisoned by Pagolo Guinigi, governor
of Lucca, for having conspired against him. Although he had been found
guilty, his life was spared, and as Pagolo thought the forgiveness
mutual, he reposed confidence in him. Jacopo, more mindful of the danger
he had incurred than of the lenity exercised toward him, on his arrival
in Florence secretly instigated the citizens to hostilities; and these
instigations, added to other hopes, induced the Signory to call the
Council together, at which 498 citizens assembled, before whom the
principal men of the city discussed the question.

Among the first who addressed the assembly in favor of the expedition,
was Rinaldo. He pointed out the advantage that would accrue from the
acquisition, and justified the enterprise from its being left open to
them by the Venetians and the duke, and that as the pope was engaged in
the affairs of Naples, he could not interfere. He then remarked upon the
facility of the expedition, showing that Lucca, being now in bondage to
one of her own citizens, had lost her natural vigor and former anxiety
for the preservation of her liberty, and would either be surrendered to
them by the people in order to expel the tyrant, or by the tyrant for
fear of the people. He recalled the remembrance of the injuries done to
the republic by the governor of Lucca; his malevolent disposition toward
them; and their embarrassing situation with regard to him, if the pope
or the duke were to make war upon them; and concluded that no enterprise
was ever undertaken by the people of Florence with such perfect
facility, more positive advantage, or greater justice in its favor.

In a reply to this, Niccolo da Uzzano stated that the city of Florence
never entered on a more unjust or more dangerous project, or one more
pregnant with evil, than this. In the first place they were going to
attack a Guelphic city, that had always been friendly to the Florentine
people, and had frequently, at great hazard, received the Guelphs into
her bosom when they were expelled from their own country. That in the
history of the past there was not an instance, while Lucca was free, of
her having done an injury to the Florentines; and that if they had been
injured by her enslavers, as formerly by Castruccio, and now by the
present governor, the fault was not in the city, but in her tyrant.
That if they could assail the latter without detriment to the people,
he should have less scruple, but as this was impossible, he could
not consent that a city which had been friendly to Florence should be
plundered of her wealth. However, as it was usual at present to pay
little or no regard either to equity or injustice, he would consider the
matter solely with reference to the advantage of Florence. He thought
that what could not easily be attended by pernicious consequences might
be esteemed useful, but he could not imagine how an enterprise should
be called advantageous in which the evils were certain and the utility
doubtful. The certain evils were the expenses with which it would be
attended; and these, he foresaw, would be sufficiently great to alarm
even a people that had long been in repose, much more one wearied, as
they were, by a tedious and expensive war. The advantage that might be
gained was the acquisition of Lucca, which he acknowledged to be great;
but the hazards were so enormous and immeasurable, as in his opinion
to render the conquest quite impossible. He could not induce himself to
believe that the Venetians, or Filippo, would willingly allow them to
make the acquisition; for the former only consented in appearance, in
order to avoid the semblance of ingratitude, having so lately, with
Florentine money, acquired such an extent of dominion. That as regarded
the duke, it would greatly gratify him to see them involved in new wars
and expenses; for, being exhausted and defeated on all sides, he might
again assail them; and that if, after having undertaken it, their
enterprise against Lucca were to prove successful, and offer them the
fullest hope of victory, the duke would not want an opportunity of
frustrating their labors, either by assisting the Lucchese secretly
with money, or by apparently disbanding his own troops, and then sending
them, as if they were soldiers of fortune, to their relief. He therefore
advised that they should give up the idea, and behave toward the tyrant
in such a way as to create him as many enemies as possible; for there
was no better method of reducing Lucca than to let them live under the
tyrant, oppressed and exhausted by him; for, if prudently managed, that
city would soon get into such a condition that he could not retain it,
and being ignorant or unable to govern itself, it must of necessity fall
into their power. But he saw that his discourse did not please them, and
that his words were unheeded; he would, however, predict this to them,
that they were about to commence a war in which they would expend vast
sums, incur great domestic dangers, and instead of becoming masters of
Lucca, they would deliver her from her tyrant, and of a friendly city,
feeble and oppressed, they would make one free and hostile, and that
in time she would become an obstacle to the greatness of their own
republic.

The question having been debated on both sides, they proceeded to vote,
as usual, and of the citizens present only ninety-eight were against the
enterprise. Thus determined in favor of war, they appointed a Council of
Ten for its management, and hired forces, both horse and foot. Astorre
Gianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi were appointed commissaries, and
Niccolo Fortebraccio, on agreeing to give up to the Florentines the
places he had taken, was engaged to conduct the enterprise as their
captain. The commissaries having arrived with the army in the country
of the Lucchese, divided their forces; one part of which, under Astorre,
extended itself along the plain, toward Camaiore and Pietrasanta, while
Rinaldo, with the other division, took the direction of the hills,
presuming that when the citizens found themselves deprived of the
surrounding country, they would easily submit. The proceedings of the
commissaries were unfortunate, not that they failed to occupy many
places, but from the complaints made against them of mismanaging the
operations of the war; and Astorre Gianni had certainly given very
sufficient cause for the charges against him.

There is a fertile and populous valley near Pietrasanta, called
Seravezza, whose inhabitants, on learning the arrival of the commissary,
presented themselves before him and begged he would receive them as
faithful subjects of the Florentine republic. Astorre pretended to
accept their proposal, but immediately ordered his forces to take
possession of all the passes and strong positions of the valley,
assembled the men in the principal church, took them all prisoners, and
then caused his people to plunder and destroy the whole country, with
the greatest avarice and cruelty, making no distinction in favor of
consecrated places, and violating the women, both married and
single. These things being known in Florence, displeased not only the
magistracy, but the whole city.



CHAPTER V

The inhabitants of Seravezza appeal to the Signory--Complaints against
Rinaldo degli Albizzi--The commissaries changed--Filippo Brunelleschi
proposes to submerge the country about Lucca--Pagolo Guinigi asks
assistance of the duke of Milan--The duke sends Francesco Sforza--Pagolo
Guinigi expelled--The Florentines routed by the forces of the duke--The
acquisitions of the Lucchese after the victory--Conclusion of the war.

A few of the inhabitants of the valley of Seravezza, having escaped the
hands of the commissary, came to Florence and acquainted every one in
the streets with their miserable situation; and by the advice of those
who, either through indignation at his wickedness or from being of
the opposite party, wished to punish the commissary, they went to the
Council of Ten, and requested an audience. This being granted, one of
them spoke to the following effect: "We feel assured, magnificent lords,
that we shall find credit and compassion from the Signory, when you
learn how your commissary has taken possession of our country, and in
what manner he has treated us. Our valley, as the memorials of your
ancient houses abundantly testify, was always Guelphic, and has
often proved a secure retreat to your citizens when persecuted by the
Ghibellines. Our forefathers, and ourselves too, have always revered the
name of this noble republic as the leader and head of their party. While
the Lucchese were Guelphs we willingly submitted to their government;
but when enslaved by the tyrant, who forsook his old friends to join
the Ghibelline faction, we have obeyed him more through force than good
will. And God knows how often we have prayed, that we might have an
opportunity of showing our attachment to our ancient party. But how
blind are mankind in their wishes! That which we desired for our safety
has proved our destruction. As soon as we learned that your ensigns were
approaching, we hastened to meet your commissary, not as an enemy,
but as the representative of our ancient lords; placed our valley, our
persons, and our fortunes in his hands, and commended them to his good
faith, believing him to possess the soul, if not of a Florentine, at
least of a man. Your lordships will forgive us; for, unable to support
his cruelties, we are compelled to speak. Your commissary has nothing of
the man but the shape, nor of a Florentine but the name; a more deadly
pest, a more savage beast, a more horrid monster never was imagined in
the human mind; for, having assembled us in our church under pretense
of wishing to speak with us, he made us prisoners. He then burned and
destroyed the whole valley, carried off our property, ravaged every
place, destroyed everything, violated the women, dishonored the virgins,
and dragging them from the arms of their mothers, gave them up to the
brutality of his soldiery. If by any injury to the Florentine people we
merited such treatment, or if he had vanquished us armed in our defense,
we should have less reason for complaint; we should have accused
ourselves, and thought that either our mismanagement or our arrogance
had deservedly brought the calamity upon us; but after having freely
presented ourselves to him unarmed, to be robbed and plundered with such
unfeeling barbarity, is more than we can bear. And though we might
have filled Lombardy with complaints and charges against this city, and
spread the story of our misfortunes over the whole of Italy, we did
not wish to slander so just and pious a republic, with the baseness and
perfidy of one wicked citizen, whose cruelty and avarice, had we known
them before our ruin was complete, we should have endeavored to satiate
(though indeed they are insatiable), and with one-half of our property
have saved the rest. But the opportunity is past; we are compelled to
have recourse to you, and beg that you will succor the distresses of
your subjects, that others may not be deterred by our example from
submitting themselves to your authority. And if our extreme distress
cannot prevail with you to assist us, be induced, by your fear of the
wrath of God, who has seen his temple plundered and burned, and his
people betrayed in his bosom." Having said this they threw themselves
on the ground, crying aloud, and praying that their property and their
country might be restored to them; and that if the Signory could not
give them back their honor, they would, at least, restore husbands to
their wives, and children to their fathers. The atrocity of the affair
having already been made known, and now by the living words of
the sufferers presented before them, excited the compassion of the
magistracy. They ordered the immediate return of Astorre, who being
tried, was found guilty, and admonished. They sought the goods of the
inhabitants of Seravezza; all that could be recovered was restored
to them, and as time and circumstance gave opportunity, they were
compensated for the rest.

Complaints were made against Rinaldo degli Albizzi, that he carried on
the war, not for the advantage of the Florentine people, but his own
private emolument; that as soon as he was appointed commissary, he lost
all desire to take Lucca, for it was sufficient for him to plunder the
country, fill his estates with cattle, and his house with booty; and,
not content with what his own satellites took, he purchased that of the
soldiery, so that instead of a commissary he became a merchant. These
calumnies coming to his ears, disturbed the temper of this proud but
upright man, more than quite became his dignity. He was so exasperated
against the citizens and magistracy, that without waiting for or asking
permission, he returned to Florence, and, presenting himself before the
Council of Ten, he said that he well knew how difficult and dangerous a
thing it was to serve an unruly people and a divided city, for the
one listens to every report, the other pursues improper measures; they
neglect to reward good conduct, and heap censure upon whatever appears
doubtful; so that victory wins no applause, error is accused by all, and
if vanquished, universal condemnation is incurred; from one's own party
through envy, and from enemies through hatred, persecution results. He
confessed that the baseness of the present calumnies had conquered his
patience and changed the temper of his mind; but he would say, he had
never, for fear of a false accusation, avoided doing what appeared to
him beneficial to the city. However, he trusted the magistrates would in
future be more ready to defend their fellow-citizens, so that the latter
might continue anxious to effect the prosperity of their country; that
as it was not customary at Florence to award triumphs for success, they
ought at least to be protected from calumny; and that being citizens
themselves, and at any moment liable to false accusations, they might
easily conceive how painful it is to an upright mind to be oppressed
with slander. The Ten endeavored, as well as circumstances would admit,
to soothe the acerbity of his feelings, and confided the care of the
expedition to Neri di Gino and Alamanno Salviati, who, instead of
overrunning the country, advanced near to Lucca. As the weather had
become extremely cold, the forces established themselves at Campannole,
which seemed to the commissaries waste of time; and wishing to draw
nearer the place, the soldiery refused to comply, although the Ten had
insisted they should pitch their camp before the city, and would not
hear of any excuse.

At that time there lived at Florence, a very distinguished architect,
named Filippo di Ser Brunelleschi, of whose works our city is full, and
whose merit was so extraordinary, that after his death his statue
in marble was erected in the principal church, with an inscription
underneath, which still bears testimony to those who read it, of his
great talents. This man pointed out, that in consequence of the relative
positions of the river Serchio and the city of Lucca, the wastes of the
river might be made to inundate the surrounding country, and place the
city in a kind of lake. His reasoning on this point appeared so clear,
and the advantage to the besiegers so obvious and inevitable, that the
Ten were induced to make the experiment. The result, however, was quite
contrary to their expectation, and produced the utmost disorder in
the Florentine camp; for the Lucchese raised high embankments in the
direction of the ditch made by our people to conduct the waters of the
Serchio, and one night cut through the embankment of the ditch itself,
so that having first prevented the water from taking the course
designed by the architect, they now caused it to overflow the plain,
and compelled the Florentines, instead of approaching the city as they
wished, to take a more remote position.

The design having failed, the Council of Ten, who had been re-elected,
sent as commissary, Giovanni Guicciardini, who encamped before Lucca,
with all possible expedition. Pagolo Guinigi finding himself thus
closely pressed, by the advice of Antonio del Rosso, then representative
of the Siennese at Lucca, sent Salvestro Trento and Leonardo Bonvisi to
Milan, to request assistance from the duke; but finding him indisposed
to comply, they secretly engaged, on the part of the people, to deliver
their governor up to him and give him possession of the place; at the
same time intimating, that if he did not immediately follow this advice,
he would not long have the opportunity, since it was the intention of
Pagolo to surrender the city to the Florentines, who were very anxious
to obtain it. The duke was so much alarmed with this idea, that, setting
aside all other considerations, he caused Count Francesco Sforza, who
was engaged in his service, to make a public request for permission
to go to Naples; and having obtained it, he proceeded with his forces
directly to Lucca, though the Florentines, aware of the deception,
and apprehensive of the consequences, had sent to the count, Boccacino
Alamanni, his friend, to frustrate this arrangement. Upon the arrival
of the count at Lucca, the Florentines removed their camp to Librafatta,
and the count proceeded immediately to Pescia, where Pagolo Diacceto
was lieutenant governor, who, promoted by fear rather than any better
motive, fled to Pistoia, and if the place had not been defended by
Giovanni Malavolti, to whom the command was intrusted, it would have
been lost. The count failing in his attempt went to Borgo a Buggiano
which he took, and burned the castle of Stigliano, in the same
neighborhood.

The Florentines being informed of these disasters, found they must have
recourse to those remedies which upon former occasions had often
proved useful. Knowing that with mercenary soldiers, when force is
insufficient, corruption commonly prevails, they offered the count a
large sum of money on condition that he should quit the city, and give
it up to them. The count finding that no more money was to be had from
Lucca, resolved to take it of those who had it to dispense, and agreed
with the Florentines, not to give them Lucca, which for decency he could
not consent to, but to withdraw his troops, and abandon it, on condition
of receiving fifty thousand ducats; and having made this agreement, to
induce the Lucchese to excuse him to the duke, he consented that they
should expel their tyrant.

Antonio del Rosso, as we remarked above, was Siennese ambassador at
Lucca, and with the authority of the count he contrived the ruin of
Pagolo Guinigi. The heads of the conspiracy were Pierro Cennami and
Giovanni da Chivizzano. The count resided upon the Serchio, at a short
distance from the city, and with him was Lanzilao, the son of Pagolo.
The conspirators, about forty in number, went armed at night in search
of Pagolo, who, on hearing the noise they made, came toward them quite
astonished, and demanded the cause of their visit; to which Piero
Cennami replied, that they had long been governed by him, and led
about against the enemy, to die either by hunger or the sword, but were
resolved to govern themselves for the future, and demanded the keys of
the city and the treasure. Pagolo said the treasure was consumed, but
the keys and himself were in their power; he only begged that as his
command had begun and continued without bloodshed, it might conclude
in the same manner. Count Francesco conducted Pagolo and his son to the
duke, and they afterward died in prison.

The departure of the count having delivered Lucca from her tyrant, and
the Florentines from their fear of his soldiery, the former prepared for
her defense, and the latter resumed the siege. They appointed the
count of Urbino to conduct their forces, and he pressed the Lucchese
so closely, that they were again compelled to ask the assistance of the
duke, who dispatched Niccolo Piccinino, under the same pretense as he
previously sent Count Francesco. The Florentine forces met him on his
approach to Lucca, and at the passage of the Serchio a battle ensued, in
which they were routed, the commissary with a few of his men escaping
to Pisa. This defeat filled the Florentines with dismay, and as the
enterprise had been undertaken with the entire approbation of the great
body of the people, they did not know whom to find fault with, and
therefore railed against those who had been appointed to the management
of the war, reviving the charges made against Rinaldo. They were,
however, more severe against Giovanni Guicciardini than any other,
declaring that if he had wished, he might have put a period to the war
at the departure of Count Francesco, but that he had been bribed with
money, for he had sent home a large sum, naming the party who had been
intrusted to bring it, and the persons to whom it had been delivered.
These complaints and accusations were carried to so great a length that
the captain of the people, induced by the public voice, and pressed by
the party opposed to the war, summoned him to trial. Giovanni appeared,
though full of indignation. However his friends, from regard to their
own character, adopted such a course with the Capitano as induced him to
abandon the inquiry.

After this victory, the Lucchese not only recovered the places that had
belonged to them, but occupied all the country of Pisa except Beintina,
Calcinaja, Livorno, and Librafatta; and, had not a conspiracy been
discovered that was formed in Pisa, they would have secured that
city also. The Florentines again prepared for battle, and appointed
Micheletto, a pupil of Sforza, to be their leader. The duke, on the
other hand, followed up this victory, and that he might bring a greater
power against the Florentines, induced the Genoese, the Siennese, and
the governor of Piombino, to enter into a league for the defense of
Lucca, and to engage Niccolo Piccinino to conduct their forces. Having
by this step declared his design, the Venetians and the Florentines
renewed their league, and the war was carried on openly in Tuscany and
Lombardy, in each of which several battles were fought with variety of
fortune. At length, both sides being wearied out, they came to terms
for the cessation of hostilities, in May, 1433. By this arrangement
the Florentines, Lucchese, and Siennese, who had each occupied many
fortresses belonging to the others, gave them all up, and each party
resumed its original possessions.



CHAPTER VI

Cosmo de' Medici, his character and mode of proceedings--The greatness
of Cosmo excites the jealousy of the citizens--The opinion of Niccolo
da Uzzano--Scandalous divisions of the Florentines--Death of Niccolo
da Uzzano--Bernardo Guadagni, Gonfalonier, adopts measures against
Cosmo--Cosmo arrested in the palace--He is apprehensive of attempts
against his life.

During the war the malignant humors of the city were in constant
activity. Cosmo de' Medici, after the death of Giovanni, engaged more
earnestly in public affairs, and conducted himself with more zeal and
boldness in regard to his friends than his father had done, so that
those who rejoiced at Giovanni's death, finding what the son was likely
to become, perceived they had no cause for exultation. Cosmo was one
of the most prudent of men; of grave and courteous demeanor, extremely
liberal and humane. He never attempted anything against parties,
or against rulers, but was bountiful to all; and by the unwearied
generosity of his disposition, made himself partisans of all ranks of
the citizens. This mode of proceeding increased the difficulties of
those who were in the government, and Cosmo himself hoped that by its
pursuit he might be able to live in Florence as much respected and
as secure as any other citizen; or if the ambition of his adversaries
compelled him to adopt a different course, arms and the favor of his
friends would enable him to become more so. Averardo de' Medici and
Puccio Pucci were greatly instrumental in the establishment of his
power; the former by his boldness, the latter by unusual prudence and
sagacity, contributed to his aggrandizement. Indeed the advice of
wisdom of Puccio were so highly esteemed, that Cosmo's party was rather
distinguished by the name of Puccio than by his own.

By this divided city the enterprise against Lucca was undertaken; and
the bitterness of party spirit, instead of being abated, increased.
Although the friends of Cosmo had been in favor of it, many of the
adverse faction were sent to assist in the management, as being men of
greater influence in the state. Averardo de' Medici and the rest being
unable to prevent this, endeavored with all their might to calumniate
them; and when any unfavorable circumstance occurred (and there were
many), fortune and the exertions of the enemy were never supposed to
be the causes, but solely the want of capacity in the commissary. This
disposition aggravated the offenses of Astorre Gianni; this excited the
indignation of Rinaldo degli Albizzi, and made him resign his commission
without leave; this, too, compelled the captain of the people to require
the appearance of Giovanni Guicciardini, and from this arose all
the other charges which were made against the magistrates and the
commissaries. Real evils were magnified, unreal ones feigned, and the
true and the false were equally believed by the people, who were almost
universally their foes.

All these events and extraordinary modes of proceeding were perfectly
known to Niccolo da Uzzano and the other leaders of the party; and they
had often consulted together for the purpose of finding a remedy, but
without effect; though they were aware of the danger of allowing them
to increase, and the great difficulty that would attend any attempt
to remove or abate them. Niccolo da Uzzano was the earliest to take
offense; and while the war was proceeding without, and these troubles
within, Niccolo Barbadoro desirous of inducing him to consent to the
ruin of Cosmo, waited upon him at his house; and finding him alone in
his study, and very pensive, endeavored, with the best reasons he could
advance, to persuade him to agree with Rinaldo on Cosmo's expulsion.
Niccolo da Uzzano replied as follows: "It would be better for thee and
thy house, as well as for our republic, if thou and those who follow
thee in this opinion had beards of silver instead of gold, as is said of
thee; for advice proceeding from the hoary head of long experience would
be wiser and of greater service to all. It appears to me, that those who
talk of driving Cosmo out of Florence would do well to consider what is
their strength, and what that of Cosmo. You have named one party,
that of the nobility, the other that of the plebeians. If the fact
corresponded with the name, the victory would still be most uncertain,
and the example of the ancient nobility of this city, who were destroyed
by the plebeians, ought rather to impress us with fear than with hope.
We have, however, still further cause for apprehension from the division
of our party, and the union of our adversaries. In the first place, Neri
di Gino and Nerone di Nigi, two of our principal citizens, have never
so fully declared their sentiments as to enable us to determine whether
they are most our friends our those of our opponents. There are many
families, even many houses, divided; many are opposed to us through
envy of brothers or relatives. I will recall to your recollection two
or three of the most important; you may think of the others at your
leisure. Of the sons of Maso degli Albizzi, Luca, from envy of Rinaldo,
has thrown himself into their hands. In the house of Guicciardini, of
the sons of Luigi, Piero is the enemy of Giovanni and in favor of our
adversaries. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini openly oppose us on account of
their hatred of their uncle Francesco. So that if we consider well what
we are, and what our enemies, I cannot see why we should be called NOBLE
any more than they. If it is because they are followed by the plebeians,
we are in a worse condition on that account, and they in a better; for
were it to come either to arms or to votes, we should not be able to
resist them. True it is, we still preserve our dignity, our precedence,
the priority of our position, but this arises from the former reputation
of the government, which has now continued fifty years; and whenever we
come to the proof, or they discover our weakness we shall lose it. If
you were to say, the justice of our cause ought to augment our influence
and diminish theirs I answer, that this justice requires to be perceived
and believed by others as well as by ourselves, but this is not the
case; for the justice of our cause is wholly founded upon our suspicion
that Cosmo designs to make himself prince of the city. And although we
entertain this suspicion and suppose it to be correct, others have it
not; but what is worse, they charge us with the very design of which
we accuse him. Those actions of Cosmo which lead us to suspect him are,
that he lends money indiscriminately, and not to private persons
only, but to the public; and not to Florentines only, but to the
_condottieri_, the soldiers of fortune. Besides, he assists any
citizen who requires magisterial aid; and, by the universal interest
he possesses in the city, raises first one friend and then another to
higher grades of honor. Therefore, to adduce our reasons for expelling
him, would be to say that he is kind, generous, liberal, and beloved
by all. Now tell me, what law is there which forbids, disapproves, or
condemns men for being pious, liberal, and benevolent? And though they
are all modes adopted by those who aim at sovereignty, they are not
believed to be such, nor have we sufficient power to make them to be
so esteemed; for our conduct has robbed us of confidence, and the city,
naturally partial and (having always lived in faction) corrupt, cannot
lend its attention to such charges. But even if we were successful in
an attempt to expel him (which might easily happen under a favorable
Signory), how could we (being surrounded by his innumerable friends, who
would constantly reproach us, and ardently desire to see him again in
the city) prevent his return? It would be impossible for they being so
numerous, and having the good will of all upon their side, we should
never be secure from them. And as many of his first discovered friends
as you might expel, so many enemies would you make, so that in a short
time he would return, and the result would be simply this, that we had
driven him out a good man and he had returned to us a bad one; for his
nature would be corrupted by those who recalled him, and he, being under
obligation, could not oppose them. Or should you design to put him to
death, you could not attain your purpose with the magistrates, for his
wealth, and the corruption of your minds, will always save him. But let
us suppose him put to death, or that being banished, he did not return,
I cannot see how the condition of our republic would be ameliorated; for
if we relieve her from Cosmo, we at once make her subject to Rinaldo,
and it is my most earnest desire that no citizen may ever, in power and
authority, surpass the rest. But if one of these must prevail, I know of
no reason that should make me prefer Rinaldo to Cosmo. I shall only
say, may God preserve the city from any of her citizens usurping the
sovereignty, but if our sins have deserved this, in mercy save us from
Rinaldo. I pray thee, therefore, do not advise the adoption of a course
on every account pernicious, nor imagine that, in union with a few, you
would be able to oppose the will of the many; for the citizens, some
from ignorance and others from malice, are ready to sell the republic at
any time, and fortune has so much favored them, that they have found a
purchaser. Take my advice then; endeavor to live moderately; and with
regard to liberty, you will find as much cause for suspicion in our
party as in that of our adversaries. And when troubles arise, being of
neither side, you will be agreeable to both, and you will thus provide
for your own comfort and do no injury to any."

These words somewhat abated the eagerness of Barbadoro, so that
tranquillity prevailed during the war with Lucca. But this being
ended, and Niccolo da Uzzano dead, the city being at peace and under no
restraint, unhealthy humors increased with fearful rapidity. Rinaldo,
considering himself now the leader of the party, constantly entreated
and urged every citizen whom he thought likely to be Gonfalonier, to
take up arms and deliver the country from him who, from the malevolence
of a few and the ignorance of the multitude, was inevitably reducing it
to slavery. These practices of Rinaldo, and those of the contrary side,
kept the city full of apprehension, so that whenever a magistracy was
created, the numbers of each party composing it were made publicly
known, and upon drawing for the Signory the whole city was aroused.
Every case brought before the magistrates, however trivial, was made a
subject of contention among them. Secrets were divulged, good and evil
alike became objects of favor and opposition, the benevolent and the
wicked were alike assailed, and no magistrate fulfilled the duties of
his office with integrity.

In this state of confusion, Rinaldo, anxious to abate the power
of Cosmo, and knowing that Bernardo Guadagni was likely to become
Gonfalonier, paid his arrears of taxes, that he might not, by being
indebted to the public, be incapacitated for holding the office. The
drawing soon after took place, and fortune, opposed to our welfare,
caused Bernardo to be appointed for the months of September and October.
Rinaldo immediately waited upon him, and intimated how much the party
of the nobility, and all who wished for repose, rejoiced to find he
had attained that dignity; that it now rested with him to act in such a
manner as to realize their pleasing expectations. He then enlarged upon
the danger of disunion, and endeavored to show that there was no means
of attaining the blessing of unity but by the destruction of Cosmo, for
he alone, by the popularity acquired with his enormous wealth, kept them
depressed; that he was already so powerful, that if not hindered, he
would soon become prince, and that it was the part of a good citizen, in
order to prevent such a calamity, to assemble the people in the piazza,
and restore liberty to his country. Rinaldo then reminded the new
Gonfalonier how Salvestro de' Medici was able, though unjustly, to
restrain the power of the Guelphs, to whom, by the blood of their
ancestors, shed in its cause, the government rightly belonged; and
argued that what he was able unjustly to accomplish against so many,
might surely be easily performed with justice in its favor against one!
He encouraged him with the assurance that their friends would be ready
in arms to support him; that he need not regard the plebeians, who
adored Cosmo, since their assistance would be of no greater avail than
Giorgio Scali had found it on a similar occasion; and that with regard
to his wealth, no apprehension was necessary, for when he was under
the power of the Signory, his riches would be so too. In conclusion, he
averred that this course would unite and secure the republic, and crown
the Gonfalonier with glory. Bernardo briefly replied, that he thought
it necessary to act exactly as Rinaldo had advised, and that as the time
was suitable for action, he should provide himself with forces, being
assured from what Rinaldo had said, he would be supported by his
colleagues.

Bernardo entered upon the duties of his office, prepared his followers,
and having concerted with Rinaldo, summoned Cosmo, who, though many
friends dissuaded him from it, obeyed the call, trusting more to his own
innocence than to the mercy of the Signory. As soon as he had entered
the palace he was arrested. Rinaldo, with a great number of armed men,
and accompanied by nearly the whole of his party, proceeded to the
piazza, when the Signory assembled the people, and created a Balia of
two hundred persons for the reformation of the city. With the least
possible delay they entered upon the consideration of reform, and of the
life or death of Cosmo. Many wished him to be banished, others to be put
to death, and several were silent, either from compassion toward him
or for fear of the rest, so that these differences prevented them from
coming to any conclusion.

There is an apartment in the tower of the palace which occupies the
whole of one floor, and is called the Alberghettino, in which Cosmo was
confined, under the charge of Federigo Malavolti. In this place, hearing
the assembly of the Councils, the noise of arms which proceeded from the
piazza, and the frequent ringing of the bell to assemble the Balia, he
was greatly apprehensive for his safety, but still more less his private
enemies should cause him to be put to death in some unusual manner.
He scarcely took any food, so that in four days he ate only a small
quantity of bread, Federigo, observing his anxiety, said to him, "Cosmo,
you are afraid of being poisoned, and are evidently hastening your end
with hunger. You wrong me if you think I would be a party to such an
atrocious act. I do not imagine your life to be in much danger, since
you have so many friends both within the palace and without; but if you
should eventually lose it, be assured they will use some other medium
than myself for that purpose, for I will never imbue my hands in the
blood of any, still less in yours, who never injured me; therefore cheer
up, take some food, and preserve your life for your friends and your
country. And that you may do so with greater assurance, I will partake
of your meals with you." These words were of great relief to Cosmo, who,
with tears in his eyes, embraced and kissed Federigo, earnestly thanking
him for so kind and affectionate conduct, and promising, if ever the
opportunity were given him, he would not be ungrateful.

Albizzi--Rinaldo takes arms against the Signory--His designs are
disconcerted--Pope Eugenius in Florence--He endeavors to reconcile the

Cosmo in some degree recovered his spirits, and while the citizens
were disputing about him, Federigo, by way of recreation, brought an
acquaintance of the Gonfalonier to take supper with him, an amusing and
facetious person, whose name was Il Farnagaccio. The repast being nearly
over, Cosmo, who thought he might turn this visit to advantage, for
he knew the man very intimately, gave a sign to Federigo to leave the
apartment, and he, guessing the cause, under pretense of going for
something that was wanted on the table, left them together. Cosmo, after
a few friendly expressions addressed to Il Farnagaccio, gave him a small
slip of paper, and desired him to go to the director of the hospital of
Santa Maria Nuova, for one thousand one hundred ducats; he was to take
the hundred for himself, and carry the thousand to the Gonfalonier,
and beg that he would take some suitable occasion of coming to see
him. Farnagaccio undertook the commission, the money was paid, Bernardo
became more humane, and Cosmo was banished to Padua, contrary to the
wish of Rinaldo, who earnestly desired his death. Averardo and many
others of the house of Medici were also banished, and with them Puccio
and Giovanni Pucci. To silence those who were dissatisfied with the
banishment of Cosmo, they endowed with the power of a Balia, the Eight
of War and the Capitano of the People. After his sentence, Cosmo on the
third of October, 1433, came before the Signory, by whom the boundary
to which he was restricted was specified; and they advised him to avoid
passing it, unless he wished them to proceed with greater severity both
against himself and his property. Cosmo received his sentence with a
cheerful look, assuring the Signory that wherever they determined to
send him, he would willingly remain. He earnestly begged, that as they
had preserved his life they would protect it, for he knew there were
many in the piazza who were desirous to take it; and assured them, that
wherever he might be, himself and his means were entirely at the service
of the city, the people, and the Signory. He was respectfully attended
by the Gonfalonier, who retained him in the palace till night, then
conducted him to his own house to supper, and caused him to be escorted
by a strong armed force to his place of banishment. Wherever the
cavalcade passed, Cosmo was honorably received, and was publicly visited
by the Venetians, not as an exile, but with all the respect due to one
in the highest station.

Florence, widowed of so great a citizen, one so generally beloved,
seemed to be universally sunk in despondency; victors and the vanquished
were alike in fear. Rinaldo, as if inspired with a presage of his future
calamities, in order not to appear deficient to himself or his party,
assembled many citizens, his friends, and informed them that he foresaw
their approaching ruin for having allowed themselves to be overcome by
the prayers, the tears, and the money of their enemies; and that they
did not seem aware they would soon themselves have to entreat and weep,
when their prayers would not be listened to, or their tears excite
compassion; and that of the money received, they would have to restore
the principal, and pay the interest in tortures, exile, and death; that
it would have been much better for them to have done nothing than to
have left Cosmo alive, and his friends in Florence; for great offenders
ought either to remain untouched, or be destroyed; that there was now
no remedy but to strengthen themselves in the city, so that upon the
renewed attempts of their enemies, which would soon take place, they
might drive them out with arms, since they had not sufficient civil
authority to expel them. The remedy to be adopted, he said, was one that
he had long before advocated, which was to regain the friendship of the
grandees, restoring and conceding to them all the honors of the city,
and thus make themselves strong with that party, since their adversaries
had joined the plebeians. That by this means they would become the more
powerful side, for they would possess greater energy, more comprehensive
talent and an augmented share of influence; and that if this last and
only remedy were not adopted, he knew not what other means could be
made use of to preserve the government among so many enemies, or prevent
their own ruin and that of the city.

Mariotto Baldovinetti, one of the assembly, was opposed to this plan, on
account of the pride and insupportable nature of the nobility; and said,
that it would be folly to place themselves again under such inevitable
tyranny for the sake of avoiding imaginary dangers from the plebeians.
Rinaldo, finding his advice unfavorably received, vexed at his own
misfortune and that of his party, imputed the whole to heaven itself,
which had resolved upon it, rather than to human ignorance and blunders.
In this juncture of affairs, no remedial measure being attempted, a
letter was found written by Agnolo Acciajuoli to Cosmo, acquainting
him with the disposition of the city in his favor, and advising him, if
possible, to excite a war, and gain the friendship of Neri di Gino; for
he imagined the city to be in want of money, and as she would not find
anyone to serve her, the remembrance of him would be revived in the
minds of the citizens, and they would desire his return; and that if
Neri were detached from Rinaldo, the party of the latter would be so
weakened, as to be unable to defend themselves. This letter coming to
the hands of the magistrates, Agnolo was taken, put to the torture, and
sent into exile. This example, however, did not at all deter Cosmo's
party.

It was now almost a year since Cosmo had been banished, and the end of
August, 1434, being come, Niccolo di Cocco was drawn Gonfalonier for
the two succeeding months, and with him eight signors, all partisans of
Cosmo. This struck terror into Rinaldo and his party; and as it is usual
for three days to elapse before the new Signory assume the magistracy
and the old resign their authority, Rinaldo again called together
the heads of his party. He endeavored to show them their certain and
immediate danger, and that their only remedy was to take arms, and cause
Donato Velluti, who was yet Gonfalonier, to assemble the people in the
piazza and create a Balia. He would then deprive the new Signory of the
magistracy, appoint another, burn the present balloting purses, and by
means of a new Squittini, provide themselves with friends. Many thought
this course safe and requisite; others, that it was too violent, and
likely to be attended with great evil. Among those who disliked it was
Palla Strozzi, a peaceable, gentle, and humane person, better adapted
for literary pursuits than for restraining a party, or opposing civil
strife. He said that bold and crafty resolutions seem promising at
their commencement, but are afterward found difficult to execute, and
generally pernicious at their conclusion; that he thought the fear of
external wars (the duke's forces being upon the confines of Romagna),
would occupy the minds of the Signory more than internal dissensions;
but, still, if any attempt should be made, and it could not take place
unnoticed, they would have sufficient time to take arms, and adopt
whatever measures might be found necessary for the common good, which
being done upon necessity, would occasion less excitement among the
people and less danger to themselves. It was therefore concluded,
that the new Signory should come in; that their proceedings should be
watched, and if they were found attempting anything against the party,
each should take arms, and meet in the piazza of San Pulinari, situated
near the palace, and whence they might proceed wherever it was found
necessary. Having come to this conclusion, Rinaldo's friends separated.

The new Signory entered upon their office, and the Gonfalonier, in order
to acquire reputation, and deter those who might intend to oppose him,
sent Donato Velluti, his predecessor, to prison, upon the charge of
having applied the public money to his own use. He then endeavored to
sound his colleagues with respect to Cosmo: seeing them desirous of his
return, he communicated with the leaders of the Medici party, and,
by their advice, summoned the hostile chiefs, Rinaldo degli Albizzi,
Ridolfo Peruzzi, and Niccolo Barbadoro. After this citation, Rinaldo
thought further delay would be dangerous: he therefore left his house
with a great number of armed men, and was soon joined by Ridolfo Peruzzi
and Niccolo Barbadoro. The force accompanying them was composed of
several citizens and a great number of disbanded soldiers then in
Florence: and all assembled according to appointment in the piazza of
San Pulinari. Palla Strozzi and Giovanni Guicciardini, though each had
assembled a large number of men, kept in their houses; and therefore
Rinaldo sent a messenger to request their attendance and to reprove
their delay. Giovanni replied, that he should lend sufficient aid
against their enemies, if by remaining at home he could prevent his
brother Piero from going to the defense of the palace. After many
messages Palla came to San Pulinari on horseback, accompanied by two
of his people on foot, and unarmed. Rinaldo, on meeting him, sharply
reproved him for his negligence, declaring that his refusal to come with
the others arose either from defect of principle or want of courage;
both of which charges should be avoided by all who wished to preserve
such a character as he had hitherto possessed; and that if he thought
this abominable conduct to his party would induce their enemies when
victorious to spare him from death or exile, he deceived himself; but
for himself (Rinaldo) whatever might happen, he had the consolation of
knowing, that previously to the crisis he had never neglected his
duty in council, and that when it occurred he had used every possible
exertion to repel it with arms; but that Palla and the others would
experience aggravated remorse when they considered they had upon three
occasions betrayed their country; first when they saved Cosmo; next when
they disregarded his advice; and now the third time by not coming armed
in her defense according to their engagement. To these reproaches Palla
made no reply audible to those around, but, muttering something as he
left them, returned to his house.

The Signory, knowing Rinaldo and his party had taken arms, finding
themselves abandoned, caused the palace to be shut up, and having no
one to consult they knew not what course to adopt. However, Rinaldo,
by delaying his coming to the piazza, having waited in expectation of
forces which did not join him, lost the opportunity of victory, gave
them courage to provide for their defense, and allowed many others
to join them, who advised that means should be used to induce their
adversaries to lay down their arms. Thereupon, some of the least
suspected, went on the part of the Signory to Rinaldo, and said,
they did not know what occasion they had given his friends for thus
assembling in arms; that they never had any intention of offending him,
and if they had spoken of Cosmo, they had no design of recalling him; so
if their fears were thus occasioned they might at once be dispelled, for
that if they came to the palace they would be graciously received, and
all their complaints attended to. These words produced no change in
Rinaldo's purpose; he bade them provide for their safety by resigning
their offices, and said that then the government of the city would be
reorganized, for the mutual benefit of all.

It rarely happens, where authorities are equal and opinions contrary,
that any good resolution is adopted. Ridolfo Peruzzi, moved by the
discourse of the citizens, said, that all he desired was to prevent
the return of Cosmo, and this being granted to them seemed a sufficient
victory; nor would he, to obtain a greater, fill the city with blood; he
would therefore obey the Signory; and accordingly went with his people
to the palace, where he was received with a hearty welcome. Thus
Rinaldo's delay at San Pulinari, Palla's want of courage, and Ridolfo's
desertion, deprived their party of all chance of success; while
the ardor of the citizens abated, and the pope's authority did not
contribute to its revival.

Pope Eugenius was at this time at Florence, having been driven from Rome
by the people. These disturbances coming to his knowledge, he thought
it a duty suitable to his pastoral office to appease them, and sent
the patriarch Giovanni Vitelleschi, Rinaldo's most intimate friend, to
entreat the latter to come to an interview with him, as he trusted
he had sufficient influence with the Signory to insure his safety
and satisfaction, without injury or bloodshed to the citizens. By his
friend's persuasion, Rinaldo proceeded with all his followers to Santa
Maria Nuova, where the pope resided. Eugenius gave him to understand,
that the Signory had empowered him to settle the differences between
them, and that all would be arranged to his satisfaction, if he laid
down his arms. Rinaldo, having witnessed Palla's want of zeal, and the
fickleness of Ridolfo Peruzzi, and no better course being open to him,
placed himself in the pope's hands, thinking that at all events the
authority of his holiness would insure his safety. Eugenius then sent
word to Niccolo Barbadoro, and the rest who remained without, that they
were to lay down their arms, for Rinaldo was remaining with the
pontiff, to arrange terms of agreement with the signors; upon which they
immediately dispersed, and laid aside their weapons.

The Signory, seeing their adversaries disarmed, continued to negotiate
an arrangement by means of the pope; but at the same time sent secretly
to the mountains of Pistoia for infantry, which, with what other forces
they could collect, were brought into Florence by night. Having taken
possession of all the strong positions in the city, they assembled the
people in the piazza and created a new balia, which, without delay,
restored Cosmo and those who had been exiled with him to their country;
and banished, of the opposite party, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, Ridolfo
Peruzzi, Niccolo Barbadoro, and Palla Strozzi, with so many other
citizens, that there were few places in Italy which did not contain
some, and many others beyond her limits were full of them. By this and
similar occurrences, Florence was deprived of men of worth, and of much
wealth and industry.

The pope, seeing such misfortunes befall those who by his entreaties
were induced to lay down their arms, was greatly dissatisfied, and
condoled with Rinaldo on the injuries he had received through his
confidence in him, but advised him to be patient, and hope for some
favorable turn of fortune. Rinaldo replied, "The want of confidence in
those who ought to have trusted me, and the great trust I have reposed
in you, have ruined both me and my party. But I blame myself principally
for having thought that you, who were expelled from your own country,
could preserve me in mine. I have had sufficient experience of the
freaks of fortune; and as I have never trusted greatly to prosperity, I
shall suffer less inconvenience from adversity; and I know that when she
pleases she can become more favorable. But if she should never change, I
shall not be very desirous of living in a city in which individuals
are more powerful than the laws; for that country alone is desirable in
which property and friends may be safely enjoyed, not one where they may
easily be taken from us, and where friends, from fear of losing their
property, are compelled to abandon each other in their greatest need.
Besides, it has always been less painful to good men to hear of the
misfortunes of their country than to witness them; and an honorable
exile is always held in greater esteem than slavery at home." He then
left the pope, and, full of indignation, blaming himself, his own
measures, and the coldness of his friends, went into exile.

Cosmo, on the other hand, being informed of his recall, returned to
Florence; and it has seldom occurred that any citizen, coming home
triumphant from victory, was received by so vast a concourse of people,
or such unqualified demonstrations of regard as he was upon his
return from banishment; for by universal consent he was hailed as the
benefactor of the people, and the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.

CHAPTER I

The vicissitudes of empires--The state of Italy--The military factions
of Sforza and Braccio--The Bracceschi and the Sforzeschi attack the
pope, who is expelled by the Romans--War between the pope and the duke
of Milan--The Florentines and the Venetians assist the pope--Peace
between the pope and the duke of Milan--Tyranny practiced by the party
favorable to the Medici.

It may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they
are subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a
state of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing
them to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their
greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner,
having been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of
depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend;
and thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again
return to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose;
repose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from
order virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune. Hence, wise men
have observed, that the age of literary excellence is subsequent to that
of distinction in arms; and that in cities and provinces, great warriors
are produced before philosophers. Arms having secured victory, and
victory peace, the buoyant vigor of the martial mind cannot be enfeebled
by a more excusable indulgence than that of letters; nor can indolence,
with any greater or more dangerous deceit, enter a well regulated
community. Cato was aware of this when the philosophers, Diogenes and
Carneades, were sent ambassadors to the senate by the Athenians; for
perceiving with what earnest admiration the Roman youth began to follow
them, and knowing the evils that might result to his country from this
specious idleness, he enacted that no philosopher should be allowed
to enter Rome. Provinces by this means sink to ruin, from which, men's
sufferings having made them wiser, they again recur to order, if they
be not overwhelmed by some extraordinary force. These causes made Italy,
first under the ancient Tuscans, and afterward under the Romans, by
turns happy and unhappy; and although nothing has subsequently arisen
from the ruins of Rome at all corresponding to her ancient greatness
(which under a well-organized monarchy might have been gloriously
effected), still there was so much bravery and intelligence in some of
the new cities and governments that afterward sprang up, that although
none ever acquired dominion over the rest, they were, nevertheless, so
balanced and regulated among themselves, as to enable them to live in
freedom, and defend their country from the barbarians.

Among these governments, the Florentines, although they possessed a
smaller extent of territory, were not inferior to any in power and
authority; for being situated in the middle of Italy, wealthy, and
prepared for action, they either defended themselves against such as
thought proper to assail them, or decided victory in favor of those
to whom they became allies. From the valor, therefore, of these new
governments, if no seasons occurred of long-continued peace, neither
were any exposed to the calamities of war; for that cannot be called
peace in which states frequently assail each other with arms, nor can
those be considered wars in which no men are slain, cities plundered,
or sovereignties overthrown; for the practice of arms fell into such a
state of decay, that wars were commenced without fear, continued without
danger, and concluded without loss. Thus the military energy which is
in other countries exhausted by a long peace, was wasted in Italy by
the contemptible manner in which hostilities were carried on, as will be
clearly seen in the events to be described from 1434 to 1494, from which
it will appear how the barbarians were again admitted into Italy, and
she again sunk under subjection to them. Although the transactions of
our princes at home and abroad will not be viewed with admiration of
their virtue and greatness like those of the ancients, perhaps they may
on other accounts be regarded with no less interest, seeing what
masses of high spirited people were kept in restraint by such weak and
disorderly forces. And if, in detailing the events which took place
in this wasted world, we shall not have to record the bravery of the
soldier, the prudence of the general, or the patriotism of the citizen,
it will be seen with what artifice, deceit, and cunning, princes,
warriors, and leaders of republics conducted themselves, to support a
reputation they never deserved. This, perhaps, will not be less useful
than a knowledge of ancient history; for, if the latter excites the
liberal mind to imitation, the former will show what ought to be avoided
and decried.

Italy was reduced to such a condition by her rulers, that when, by
consent of her princes, peace was restored, it was soon disturbed by
those who retained their armies, so that glory was not gained by war nor
repose by peace. Thus when the league and the duke of Milan agreed to
lay aside their arms in 1433, the soldiers, resolved upon war, directed
their efforts against the church. There were at this time two factions
or armed parties in Italy, the Sforzesca and the Braccesca. The leader
of the former was the Count Francesco, the son of Sforza, and of the
latter, Niccolo Piccinino and Niccolo Fortebraccio. Under the banner
of one or other of these parties almost all the forces of Italy were
assembled. Of the two, the Sforzesca was in greatest repute, as well
from the bravery of the count himself, as from the promise which the
duke of Milan had made him of his natural daughter, Madonna Bianca, the
prospect of which alliance greatly strengthened his influence. After
the peace of Lombardy, these forces, from various causes attacked Pope
Eugenius. Niccolo Fortebraccio was instigated by the ancient enmity
which Braccio had always entertained against the church; the count was
induced by ambition: so that Niccolo assailed Rome, and the count took
possession of La Marca.

The Romans, in order to avoid the war, drove Pope Eugenius from their
city: and he, having with difficulty escaped, came to Florence, where
seeing the imminent danger of his situation, being abandoned by the
princes (for they were unwilling again to take up arms in his cause,
after having been so anxious to lay them aside), he came to terms with
the count, and ceded to him the sovereignty of La Marca, although, to
the injury of having occupied it, he had added insult; for in signing
the place, from which he addressed letters to his agents, he said in
Latin, according to the Latin custom, _Ex Girfalco nostro Firmiano,
invito Petro et Paulo_. Neither was he satisfied with this concession,
but insisted upon being appointed Gonfalonier of the church, which was
also granted; so much more was Eugenius alarmed at the prospect of a
dangerous war than of an ignominious peace. The count, having been
thus been reconciled to the pontiff, attacked Niccolo Fortebraccio, and
during many months various encounters took place between them, from
all which greater injury resulted to the pope and his subjects, than to
either of the belligerents. At length, by the intervention of the duke
of Milan, an arrangement, by way of a truce, was made, by which both
became princes in the territories of the church.

The war thus extinguished at Rome was rekindled in Romagna by Batista
da Canneto, who at Bologna slew some of the family of the Grifoni, and
expelled from the city the governor who resided there for the pope,
along with others who were opposed to him. To enable himself to retain
the government, he applied for assistance to Filippo; and the pope,
to avenge himself for the injury, sought the aid of the Venetians and
Florentines. Both parties obtained assistance, so that very soon two
large armies were on foot in Romagna. Niccolo Piccinino commanded for
the duke, Gattamelata and Niccolo da Tolentino for the Venetians and
Florentines. They met near Imola, where a battle ensued, in which the
Florentines and Venetians were routed, and Niccolo da Tolentino was sent
prisoner to Milan where, either through grief for his loss or by some
unfair means, he died in a few days.

The duke, on this victory, either being exhausted by the late wars, or
thinking the League after their defeat would not be in haste to resume
hostilities, did not pursue his good fortune, and thus gave the pope and
his colleagues time to recover themselves. They therefore appointed
the Count Francesco for their leader, and undertook to drive Niccolo
Fortebraccio from the territories of the church, and thus terminate
the war which had been commenced in favor of the pontiff. The Romans,
finding the pope supported by so large an army, sought a reconciliation
with him, and being successful, admitted his commissary into the
city. Among the places possessed by Niccolo Fortebraccio, were Tivoli,
Montefiascone, Citta di Castello, and Ascesi, to the last of which, not
being able to keep the field, he fled, and the count besieged him there.
Niccolo's brave defense making it probable that the war would be of
considerable duration, the duke deemed to necessary to prevent the
League from obtaining the victory, and said that if this were not
effected he would very soon have to look at the defense of his own
territories. Resolving to divert the count from the siege, he commanded
Niccolo Piccinino to pass into Tuscany by way of Romagna; and the
League, thinking it more important to defend Tuscany than to occupy
Ascesi, ordered the count to prevent the passage of Niccolo, who was
already, with his army, at Furli. The count accordingly moved with his
forces, and came to Cesena, having left the war of La Marca and the care
of his own territories to his brother Lione; and while Niccolo Piccinino
was endeavoring to pass by, and the count to prevent him, Fortebraccio
attacked Lione with great bravery, made him prisoner, routed his forces,
and pursuing the advantage of his victory, at once possessed himself of
many places in La Marca. This circumstance greatly perplexed the count,
who thought he had lost all his territories; so, leaving part of his
force to check Piccinino, with the remainder he pursued Fortebraccio,
whom he attacked and conquered. Fortebraccio was taken prisoner in the
battle, and soon after died of his wounds. This victory restored to the
pontiff all the places that had been taken from him by Fortebraccio, and
compelled the duke of Milan to sue for peace, which was concluded by the
intercession of Niccolo da Esta, marquis of Ferrara; the duke restoring
to the church the places he had taken from her, and his forces retiring
into Lombardy. Batista da Canneto, as in the case with all who retain
authority only by the consent and forces of another, when the duke's
people had quitted Romagna, unable with his own power to keep possession
of Bologna, fled, and Antonio Bentivogli, the head of the opposite
party, returned to his country.

All this took place during the exile of Cosmo, after whose return,
those who had restored him, and a great number of persons injured by the
opposite party, resolved at all events to make themselves sure of the
government; and the Signory for the months of November and December, not
content with what their predecessors had done in favor of their party
extended the term and changed the residences of several who were
banished, and increased the number of exiles. In addition to these
evils, it was observed that citizens were more annoyed on account of
their wealth, their family connections or private animosities, than
for the sake of the party to which they adhered, so that if these
prescriptions had been accompanied with bloodshed, they would have
resembled those of Octavius and Sylla, though in reality they were not
without some stains; for Antonio di Bernardo Guadagni was beheaded, and
four other citizens, among whom were Zanobi dei Belfratelli and Cosmo
Barbadori, passing the confines to which they were limited, proceeded to
Venice, where the Venetians, valuing the friendship of Cosmo de' Medici
more than their own honor, sent them prisoners to him, and they were
basely put to death. This circumstance greatly increased the influence
of that party, and struck their enemies with terror, finding that such
a powerful republic would so humble itself to the Florentines. This,
however, was supposed to have been done, not so much out of kindness to
Cosmo, as to excite dissensions in Florence, and by means of bloodshed
make greater certainty of division among the citizens, for the Venetians
knew there was no other obstacle to their ambition so great as the union
of her people.

The city being cleared of the enemies, or suspected enemies of the
state, those in possession of the government now began to strengthen
their party by conferring benefits upon such as were in a condition
to serve them, and the family of the Alberti, with all who had been
banished by the former government, were recalled. All the nobility,
with few exceptions, were reduced to the ranks of the people, and the
possessions of the exiles were divided among themselves, upon each
paying a small acknowledgment. They then fortified themselves with new
laws and provisos, made new Squittini, withdrawing the names of their
adversaries from the purses, and filling them with those of their
friends. Taking advice from the ruin of their enemies, they considered
that to allow the great offices to be filled by mere chance of drawing,
did not afford the government sufficient security, they therefore
resolved that the magistrates possessing the power of life and death
should always be chosen from among the leaders of their own party,
and therefore that the _Accoppiatori_, or persons selected for the
imborsation of the new Squittini, with the Signory who had to retire
from office, should make the new appointments. They gave to eight of the
guard authority to proceed capitally, and provided that the exiles, when
their term of banishment was complete, should not be allowed to return,
unless from the Signory and Colleagues, which were thirty-seven in
number, the consent of thirty-four was obtained. It was made unlawful
to write to or to receive letters from them; every word, sign, or action
that gave offense to the ruling party was punished with the utmost
rigor; and if there was still in Florence any suspected person whom
these regulations did not reach, he was oppressed with taxes imposed for
the occasion. Thus in a short time, having expelled or impoverished the
whole of the adverse party, they established themselves firmly in the
government. Not to be destitute of external assistance, and to deprive
others of it, who might use it against themselves, they entered into a
league, offensive and defensive, with the pope, the Venetians, and the
duke of Milan.



CHAPTER II

Death of Giovanni II.--René of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon aspire to
the kingdom--Alfonso is routed and taken by the Genoese--Alfonso being
a prisoner of the duke of Milan, obtains his friendship--The Genoese
disgusted with the duke of Milan--Divisions among the Genoese--The
Genoese, by means of Francesco Spinola, expel the duke's
governor--League against the duke of Milan--Rinaldo degli Albizzi
advises the duke to make war against the Florentines--His discourse to
the duke--The duke adopts measures injurious to the Florentines--Niccolo
Piccinino appointed to command the duke's forces--Preparations of the
Florentines--Piccinino routed before Barga.

The affairs of Florence being in this condition, Giovanna, queen
of Naples, died, and by her will appointed René of Anjou to be her
successor. Alfonso, king of Aragon, was at this time in Sicily, and
having obtained the concurrence of many barons, prepared to take
possession of the kingdom. The Neapolitans, with whom a greater number
of barons were also associated, favored René. The pope was unwilling
that either of them should obtain it; but desired the affairs of Naples
to be administered by a governor of his own appointing.

In the meantime Alfonso entered the kingdom, and was received by the
duke of Sessa; he brought with him some princes, whom he had engaged in
his service, with the design (already possessing Capua, which the prince
of Taranto held in his name) of subduing the Neapolitans, and sent his
fleet to attack Gaeta, which had declared itself in their favor. They
therefore demanded assistance of the duke of Milan, who persuaded the
Genoese to undertake their defense; and they, to satisfy the duke their
sovereign, and protect the merchandise they possessed, both at Naples
and Gaeta, armed a powerful fleet. Alfonso hearing of this, augmented
his own naval force, went in person to meet the Genoese, and coming up
with them near the island of Ponzio, an engagement ensued, in which the
Aragonese were defeated, and Alfonso, with many of the princes of his
suite, made prisoners, and sent by the Genoese to the Filippo.

This victory terrified the princes of Italy, who, being jealous of the
duke's power, thought it would give him a great opportunity of being
sovereign of the whole country. But so contrary are the views of men,
that he took a directly opposite course. Alfonso was a man of
great sagacity, and as soon as an opportunity presented itself
of communicating with Filippo, he proved to him how completely he
contravened his own interests, by favoring René and opposing himself;
for it would be the business of the former, on becoming king of Naples,
to introduce the French into Milan; that in an emergency he might have
assistance at hand, without the necessity of having to solicit a passage
for his friends. But he could not possibly secure this advantage without
effecting the ruin of the duke, and making his dominions a French
province; and that the contrary of all this would result from himself
becoming lord of Naples; for having only the French to fear, he would be
compelled to love and caress, nay even to obey those who had it in their
power to open a passage for his enemies. That thus the title of king
of king of Naples would be with himself (Alfonso), but the power and
authority with Filippo; so that it was much more the duke's business
than his own to consider the danger of one course and the advantage of
the other; unless he rather wished to gratify his private prejudices
than to give security to his dominions. In the one case he would be a
free prince, in the other, placed between two powerful sovereigns, he
would either be robbed of his territories or live in constant fear, and
have to obey them like a slave. These arguments so greatly influenced
the duke, that, changing his design, he set Alfonso at liberty, sent
him honorably to Genoa and then to Naples. From thence the king went
to Gaeta, which as soon as his liberation had become known, was taken
possession of by some nobles of his party.

The Genoese, seeing that the duke, without the least regard for them,
had liberated the king, and gained credit to himself through the dangers
and expense which they had incurred; that he enjoyed all the honor of
the liberation, and they were themselves exposed to the odium of the
capture, and the injuries consequent upon the king's defeat, were
greatly exasperated. In the city of Genoa, while in the enjoyment of her
liberty, a magistrate is created with the consent of the people, whom
they call the Doge; not that he is absolutely a prince, or that he alone
has the power of determining matters of government; but that, as the
head of the state, he proposes those questions or subjects which have
to be considered and determined by the magistrates and the councils. In
that city are many noble families so powerful, that they are with great
difficulty induced to submit to the authority of the law. Of these,
the most powerful are the Fregosa and the Adorna, from whom arise the
dissensions of the city, and the impotence of her civil regulations; for
the possession of this high office being contested by means inadmissible
in well-regulated communities, and most commonly with arms in their
hands, it always occurs that one party is oppressed and the other
triumphant; and sometimes those who fail in the pursuit have recourse to
the arms of strangers, and the country they are not allowed to rule they
subject to foreign authority. Hence it happens, that those who govern in
Lombardy most commonly command in Genoa, as occurred at the time Alfonso
of Aragon was made prisoner. Among the leading Genoese who had been
instrumental in subjecting the republic to Filippo, was Francesco
Spinola, who, soon after he had reduced his country to bondage, as
always happens in such cases, became suspected by the duke. Indignant at
this, he withdrew to a sort of voluntary exile at Gaeta, and being
there when the naval expedition was in preparation, and having conducted
himself with great bravery in the action, he thought he had again
merited so much of the duke's confidence as would obtain for him
permission to remain undisturbed at Genoa. But the duke still retained
his suspicions; for he could not believe that a vacillating defender of
his own country's liberty would be faithful to himself; and Francesco
Spinola resolved again to try his fortune, and if possible restore
freedom to his country, and honorable safety for himself; for he was
there was no probability of regaining the forfeited affection of
his fellow-citizens, but by resolving at his own peril to remedy the
misfortunes which he had been so instrumental in producing. Finding the
indignation against the duke universal, on account of the liberation
of the king, he thought the moment propitious for the execution of his
design. He communicated his ideas to some whom he knew to be similarly
inclined, and his arguments ensured their co-operation.

The great festival of St. John the Baptist being come, when Arismeno,
the new governor sent by the duke, was to enter Genoa, and he being
already arrived, accompanied by Opicino, the former governor, and many
Genoese citizens, Francesco Spinola thought further delay improper; and,
issuing from his house with those acquainted with his design, all armed,
they raised the cry of liberty. It was wonderful to see how eagerly the
citizens and people assembled at the word; so that those who for any
reason might be favorable to Filippo, not only had no time to arm, but
scarcely to consider the means of escape. Arismeno, with some Genoese,
fled to the fortress which was held for the duke, Opicino, thinking that
if he could reach the palace, where two thousand men were in arms, and
at his command, he might be able either to effect his own safety, or
induce his friends to defend themselves, took that direction; but before
he arrived at the piazza he was slain, his body divided into many pieces
and scattered about the city. The Genoese having placed the government
in the hands of free magistrates, in a few days recovered the castle,
and the other strongholds possessed by the duke, and delivered
themselves entirely from his yoke.

These transactions, though at first they had alarmed the princes of
Italy with the apprehension that the duke would become too powerful,
now gave them hope, seeing the turn they had taken, of being able to
restrain him; and, notwithstanding the recent league, the Florentines
and Venetians entered into alliance with the Genoese. Rinaldo degli
Albizzi and the other leading Florentine exiles, observing the altered
aspect of affairs, conceived hopes of being able to induce the duke
to make war against Florence, and having arrived at Milan, Rinaldo
addressed him in the following manner: "If we, who were once your
enemies, come now confidently to supplicate your assistance to enable
us to return to our country, neither you, nor anyone, who considers the
course and vicissitudes of human affairs, can be at all surprised; for
of our past conduct toward yourself and our present intentions toward
our country, we can adduce palpable and abundant reasons. No good man
will ever reproach another who endeavors to defend his country, whatever
be his mode of doing so; neither have we had any design of injuring
you, but only to preserve our country from detriment; and we appeal to
yourself, whether, during the greatest victories of our league, when you
were really desirous of peace, we were not even more anxious for it than
yourself; so that we do not think we have done aught to make us despair
altogether of favor from you. Nor can our country itself complain that
we now exhort you to use those arms against her, from which we have so
pertinaciously defended her; for that state alone merits the love of
all her citizens, which cares with equal affection for all; not one that
favors a few, and casts from her the great mass of her children. Nor are
the arms that men use against their country to be universally condemned;
for communities, although composed of many, resemble individual bodies;
and as in these, many infirmities arise which cannot be cured without
the application of fire or of steel, so in the former, there often occur
such numerous and great evils, that a good and merciful citizen, when
there is a necessity for the sword, would be much more to blame in
leaving her uncured, than by using this remedy for her preservation.
What greater disease can afflict a republic than slavery? and what
remedy is more desirable for adoption than the one by which alone it can
be effectually removed? No wars are just but those that are necessary;
and force is merciful when it presents the only hope of relief. I know
not what necessity can be greater than ours, or what compassion can
exceed that which rescues our country from slavery. Our cause is
therefore just, and our purpose merciful, as both yourself and we may
be easily convinced. The amplest justice is on your side; for the
Florentines have not hesitated, after a peace concluded with so much
solemnity, to enter into league with those who have rebelled against
you; so that if our cause is insufficient to excite you against them,
let your own just indignation do so; and the more so, seeing the
facility of the undertaking. You need be under no apprehension from the
memory of the past, in which you may have observed the power of
that people and their pertinency in self-defense; though these might
reasonably excite fear, if they were still animated by the valor of
former times. But now, all is entirely the reverse; for what power can
be expected in a city that has recently expelled the greatest part of
her wealth and industry? What indomitable resolution need be apprehended
from the people whom so many and such recent enmities have disunited?
The disunion which still prevails will prevent wealthy citizens
advancing money as they used to do on former occasions; for though men
willingly contribute according to their means, when they see their own
credit, glory, and private advantage dependent upon it, or when there
is a hope of regaining in peace what has been spent in war, but not when
equally oppressed under all circumstances, when in war they suffer the
injuries of the enemy, and in peace, the insolence of those who govern
them. Besides this, the people feel more deeply the avarice of their
rulers, than the rapacity of the enemy; for there is hope of being
ultimately relieved from the latter evil, but none from the former.
Thus, in the last war, you had to contend with the whole city; but now
with only a small portion. You attempted to take the government from
many good citizens; but now you oppose only a few bad ones. You then
endeavored to deprive a city of her liberty, now you come to restore
it. As it is unreasonable to suppose that under such disparity of
circumstances, the result should be the same, you have now every reason
to anticipate an easy victory; and how much it will strengthen your own
government, you may easily judge; having Tuscany friendly, and bound by
so powerful an obligation, in your enterprises, she will be even of more
service to you than Milan. And, although, on former occasions, such an
acquisition might be looked upon as ambitious and unwarrantable, it will
now be considered merciful and just. Then do not let this opportunity
escape, and be assured, that although your attempts against the city
have been attended with difficulty, expense, and disgrace, this will
with facility procure you incalculable advantage and an honorable
renown."

Many words were not requisite to induce the duke to hostilities against
the Florentines, for he was incited to it by hereditary hatred and blind
ambition, and still more, by the fresh injuries which the league with
the Genoese involved; yet his past expenses, the dangerous measures
necessary, the remembrance of his recent losses, and the vain hopes of
the exiles, alarmed him. As soon as he had learned the revolt of Genoa,
he ordered Niccolo Piccinino to proceed thither with all his cavalry
and whatever infantry he could raise, for the purpose of recovering
her, before the citizens had time to become settled and establish a
government; for he trusted greatly in the fortress within the city,
which was held for him. And although Niccolo drove the Genoese from
the mountains, took from them the valley of Pozeveri, where they had
entrenched themselves, and obliged them to seek refuge within the walls
of the city, he still found such an insurmountable obstacle in the
resolute defense of the citizens, that he was compelled to withdraw. On
this, at the suggestion of the Florentine exiles, he commanded Niccolo
to attack them on the eastern side, upon the confines of Pisa in the
Genoese territory, and to push the war with his utmost vigor, thinking
this plan would manifest and develop the course best to be adopted.
Niccolo therefore besieged and took Serezana, and having committed great
ravages, by way of further alarming the Florentines he proceeded to
Lucca, spreading a report that it was his intention to go to Naples
to render assistance to the king of Aragon. Upon these new events Pope
Eugenius left Florence and proceeded to Bologna, where he endeavored
to effect an amicable arrangement between the league and the duke,
intimating to the latter, that if he would not consent to some treaty,
the pontiff must send Francesco Sforza to assist the league, for the
latter was now his confederate, and served in his pay. Although the pope
greatly exerted himself in this affair, his endeavors were unavailing;
for the duke would not listen to any proposal that did not leave him the
possession of Genoa, and the league had resolved that she should remain
free; and, therefore, each party, having no other resource, prepared to
continue the war.

In the meantime Niccolo Piccinino arrived at Lucca, and the Florentines,
being doubtful what course to adopt, ordered Neri di Gino to lead their
forces into the Pisan territory, induced the pontiff to allow Count
Francesco to join him, and with their forces they halted at San Gonda.
Piccinino then demanded admission into the kingdom of Naples, and this
being refused, he threatened to force a passage. The armies were
equal, both in regard of numbers and the capacity of their leaders, and
unwilling to tempt fortune during the bad weather, it being the month of
December, they remained several days without attacking each other. The
first movement was made by Niccolo Piccinino, who being informed that if
he attacked Vico Pisano by night, he could easily take possession of
the place, made the attempt, and having failed, ravaged the surrounding
country, and then burned and plundered the town of San Giovanni alla
Vena. This enterprise, though of little consequence, excited him to make
further attempts, the more so from being assured that the count and Neri
were yet in their quarters, and he attacked Santa Maria in Castello and
Filetto, both which places he took. Still the Florentine forces would
not stir; not that the count entertained any fear, but because, out of
regard to the pope, who still labored to effect an accommodation, the
government of Florence had deferred giving their final consent to the
war. This course, which the Florentines adopted from prudence, was
considered by the enemy to be only the result of timidity, and with
increased boldness they led their forces up to Barga, which they
resolved to besiege. This new attack made the Florentines set aside
all other considerations, and resolve not only to relieve Barga, but
to invade the Lucchese territory. Accordingly the count proceeded in
pursuit of Niccolo, and coming up with him before Barga, an engagement
took place, in which Piccinino was overcome, and compelled to raise the
siege.

The Venetians considering the duke to have broken the peace, send Giovan
Francesco da Gonzaga, their captain, to Ghiaradadda, who, by severely
wasting the duke's territories, induced him to recall Niccolo Piccinino
from Tuscany. This circumstance, together with the victory obtained over
Niccolo, emboldened the Florentines to attempt the recovery of Lucca,
since the duke, whom alone they feared, was engaged with the Venetians,
and the Lucchese having received the enemy into their city, and allowed
him to attack them, would have no ground of complaint.



CHAPTER III

The Florentines go to war with Lucca--Discourse of a citizen of Lucca to
animate the plebeians against the Florentines--The Lucchese resolve
to defend themselves--They are assisted by the duke of Milan--Treaty
between the Florentines and the Venetians--Francesco Sforza, captain of
the league, refuses to cross the Po in the service of the Venetians
and returns to Tuscany--The bad faith of the Venetians toward the
Florentines--Cosmo de' Medici at Venice--Peace between the Florentines
and the Lucchese--The Florentines effect a reconciliation between the
pope and the Count di Poppi--The pope consecrates the church of Santa
Reparata--Council of Florence.

The count commenced operations against Lucca in April, 1437, and the
Florentines, desirous of recovering what they had themselves lost before
they attacked others, retook Santa Maria in Castello, and all the places
which Piccinino had occupied. Then, entering the Lucchese territory,
they besieged Camaiore, the inhabitants of which, although faithful
to their rulers, being influenced more by immediate danger than by
attachment to their distant friends, surrendered. In the same manner,
they obtained Massa and Serezana. Toward the end of May they proceeded
in the direction of Lucca, burning the towns, destroying the growing
crops, grain, trees, and vines, driving away the cattle, and leaving
nothing undone to injure the enemy. The Lucchese, finding themselves
abandoned by the duke, and hopeless of defending the open country,
forsook it; entrenched and fortified the city, which they doubted not,
being well garrisoned, they would be able to defend for a time, and
that, in the interim, some event would occur for their relief, as had
been the case during the former wars which the Florentines had carried
on against them. Their only apprehension arose from the fickle minds
of the plebeians, who, becoming weary of the siege, would have more
consideration of their own danger than of other's liberty, and would
thus compel them to submit to some disgraceful and ruinous capitulation.
In order to animate them to defense, they were assembled in the public
piazza, and some of the eldest and most esteemed of the citizens
addressed them in the following terms: "You are doubtless aware that
what is done from necessity involves neither censure nor applause;
therefore, if you should accuse us of having caused the present war, by
receiving the ducal forces into the city, and allowing them to commit
hostilities against the Florentines, you are greatly mistaken. You are
well acquainted with the ancient enmity of the Florentines against you,
which is not occasioned by any injuries you have done them, or by fear
on their part, but by our weakness and their own ambition; for the one
gives them hope of being able to oppress us, and the other incites them
to attempt it. It is then vain to imagine that any merit of yours can
extinguish that desire in them, or that any offense you can commit, can
provoke them to greater animosity. They endeavor to deprive you of your
liberty; you must resolve to defend it; and whatever they may undertake
against us for that purpose, although we may lament, we need not wonder.
We may well grieve, therefore, that they attack us, take possession of
our towns, burn our houses, and waste our country. But who is so simple
as to be surprised at it? for were it in our power, we should do just
the same to them, or even worse. They declare war against us now, they
say, for having received Niccolo; but if we had not received him, they
would have done the same and assigned some other ground for it; and if
the evil had been delayed, it would most probably have been greater.
Therefore, you must not imagine it to be occasioned by his arrival, but
rather by your own ill fortune and their ambition; for we could not have
refused admission to the duke's forces, and, being come, we could
not prevent their aggressions. You know, that without the aid of some
powerful ally we are incapable of self-defense, and that none can render
us this service more powerfully or faithfully than the duke. He restored
our liberty; it is reasonable to expect he will defend it. He has always
been the greatest foe of our inveterate enemies; if, therefore, to avoid
incensing the Florentines we had excited his anger, we should have lost
our best friend, and rendered our enemy more powerful and more disposed
to oppress us; so that it is far preferable to have this war upon our
hands, and enjoy the favor of the duke, than to be in peace without it.
Besides, we are justified in expecting that he will rescue us from the
dangers into which we are brought on his account, if we only do not
abandon our own cause. You all know how fiercely the Florentines have
frequently assailed us, and with what glory we have maintained our
defense. We have often been deprived of every hope, except in God
and the casualties which time might produce, and both have proved our
friends. And as they have delivered us formerly, why should they not
continue to do so. Then we were forsaken by the whole of Italy; now we
have the duke in our favor; besides we have a right to suppose that the
Venetians will not hastily attack us; for they will not willingly see
the power of Florence increased. On a former occasion the Florentines
were more at liberty; they had greater hope of assistance, and were more
powerful in themselves, while we were in every respect weaker; for then
a tyrant governed us, now we defend ourselves; then the glory of our
defense was another's, now it is our own; then they were in harmony, now
they are disunited, all Italy being filled with their banished citizens.
But were we without the hope which these favorable circumstances
present, our extreme necessity should make us firmly resolved on our
defense. It is reasonable to fear every enemy, for all seek their
own glory and your ruin; above all others, you have to dread the
Florentines, for they would not be satisfied by submission and tribute,
or the dominion of our city, but they would possess our entire substance
and persons, that they might satiate their cruelty with our blood, and
their avarice with our property, so that all ranks ought to dread them.
Therefore do not be troubled at seeing our crops destroyed, our towns
burned, our fortresses occupied; for if we preserve the city, the rest
will be saved as a matter of course; if we lose her, all else would be
of no advantage to us; for while retaining our liberty, the enemy can
hold them only with the greatest difficulty, while losing it they would
be preserved in vain. Arm, therefore; and when in the fight, remember
that the reward of victory will be safety, not only to your country, but
to your homes, your wives, and your children." The speaker's last words
were received with the utmost enthusiasm by the people, who promised one
and all to die rather than abandon their cause, or submit to any terms
that could violate their liberty. They then made arrangements for the
defense of the city.

In the meantime, the Florentine forces were not idle; and after
innumerable mischiefs done to the country took Monte Carlo by
capitulation. They then besieged Uzzano, in order that the Lucchese,
being pressed on all sides, might despair of assistance, and be
compelled to submission by famine. The fortress was very strong, and
defended by a numerous garrison, so that its capture would be by no
means an easy undertaking. The Lucchese, as might be expected, seeing
the imminent peril of their situation, had recourse to the duke, and
employed prayers and remonstrances to induce him to render them aid.
They enlarged upon their own merits and the offenses of the Florentines;
and showed how greatly it would attach the duke's friends to him to
find they were defended, and how much disaffection it would spread among
them, if they were left to be overwhelmed by the enemy; that if they
lost their liberties and their lives, he would lose his honor and his
friends, and forfeit the confidence of all who from affection might be
induced to incur dangers in his behalf; and added tears to entreaties,
so that if he were unmoved by gratitude to them, he might be induced
to their defense by motives of compassion. The duke, influenced by his
inveterate hostility against the Florentines, his new obligation to
the Lucchese, and, above all, by his desire to prevent so great
an acquisition from falling into the hands of his ancient enemies,
determined either to send a strong force into Tuscany, or vigorously to
assail the Venetians, so as to compel the Florentines to give up their
enterprise and go to their relief.

It was soon known in Florence that the duke was preparing to send forces
into Tuscany. This made the Florentines apprehensive for the success
of their enterprise; and in order to retain the duke in Lombardy, they
requested the Venetians to press him with their utmost strength. But
they also were alarmed, the marquis of Mantua having abandoned them and
gone over to the duke; and thus, finding themselves almost defenseless,
they replied, "that instead of increasing their responsibilities, they
should be unable to perform their part in the war, unless the Count
Francesco were sent to them to take the command of the army, and with
the special understanding that he should engage to cross the Po in
person. They declined to fulfil their former engagements unless he were
bound to do so; for they could not carry on the war without a leader,
or repose confidence in any except the count; and he himself would be
useless to them, unless he came under an obligation to carry on the
war whenever they might think needful." The Florentines thought the war
ought to be pushed vigorously in Lombardy; but they saw that if they
lost the count their enterprise against Lucca was ruined; and they knew
well that the demand of the Venetians arose less from any need they had
of the count, than from their desire to frustrate this expedition. The
count, on the other hand, was ready to pass into Lombardy whenever
the league might require him, but would not alter the tenor of his
engagement; for he was unwilling to sacrifice the hope of the alliance
promised to him by the duke.

The Florentines were thus embarrassed by two contrary impulses, the
wish to possess Lucca, and the dread of a war with Milan. As commonly
happens, fear was the most powerful, and they consented, after the
capture of Uzzano, that the count should go into Lombardy. There still
remained another difficulty, which, depending on circumstances beyond
the reach of their influence, created more doubts and uneasiness
than the former; the count would not consent to pass the Po, and the
Venetians refused to accept him on any other condition. Seeing no other
method of arrangement, than that each should make liberal concessions,
the Florentines induced the count to cross the river by a letter
addressed to the Signory of Florence, intimating that this private
promise did not invalidate any public engagement, and that he might
still refrain from crossing; hence it resulted that the Venetians,
having commenced the war, would be compelled to proceed, and that the
evil apprehended by the Florentines would be averted. To the
Venetians, on the other hand, they averred that this private letter was
sufficiently binding, and therefore they ought to be content; for if
they could save the count from breaking with his father-in-law, it was
well to do so, and that it could be of no advantage either to themselves
or the Venetians to publish it without some manifest necessity. It was
thus determined that the count should pass into Lombardy; and having
taken Uzzano, and raised bastions about Lucca to restrain in her
inhabitants, placed the management of the siege in the hands of the
commissaries, crossed the Apennines, and proceeded to Reggio, when
the Venetians, alarmed at his progress, and in order to discover his
intentions, insisted upon his immediately crossing the Po, and joining
the other forces. The count refused compliance, and many mutual
recriminations took place between him and Andrea Mauroceno, their
messenger on this occasion, each charging the other with arrogance
and treachery: after many protestations, the one of being under no
obligation to perform that service, and the other of not being bound to
any payment, they parted, the count to return to Tuscany, the other to
Venice.

The Florentines had sent the count to encamp in the Pisan territory, and
were in hopes of inducing him to renew the war against the Lucchese, but
found him indisposed to do so, for the duke, having been informed that
out of regard to him he had refused to cross the Po, thought that by
this means he might also save the Lucchese, and begged the count to
endeavor to effect an accommodation between the Florentines and the
Lucchese, including himself in it, if he were able, declaring, at
the same time, the promised marriage should be solemnized whenever he
thought proper. The prospect of this connection had great influence with
the count, for, as the duke had no sons, it gave him hope of becoming
sovereign of Milan. For this reason he gradually abated his exertions
in the war, declared he would not proceed unless the Venetians fulfilled
their engagement as to the payment, and also retained him in the
command; that the discharge of the debt would not alone be sufficient,
for desiring to live peaceably in his own dominions, he needed some
alliance other than that of the Florentines, and that he must regard his
own interests, shrewdly hinting that if abandoned by the Venetians, he
would come to terms with the duke.

These indirect and crafty methods of procedure were highly offensive
to the Florentines, for they found their expedition against Lucca
frustrated, and trembled for the safety of their own territories if ever
the count and the duke should enter into a mutual alliance. To induce
the Venetians to retain the count in the command, Cosmo de' Medici went
to Venice, hoping his influence would prevail with them, and discussed
the subject at great length before the senate, pointing out the
condition of the Italian states, the disposition of their armies, and
the great preponderance possessed by the duke. He concluded by saying,
that if the count and the duke were to unite their forces, they (the
Venetians) might return to the sea, and the Florentines would have to
fight for their liberty. To this the Venetians replied, that they were
acquainted with their own strength and that of the Italians, and thought
themselves able at all events to provide for their own defense; that
it was not their custom to pay soldiers for serving others; that as the
Florentines had used the count's services, they must pay him themselves;
with respect to the security of their own states, it was rather
desirable to check the count's pride than to pay him, for the ambition
of men is boundless, and if he were now paid without serving, he would
soon make some other demand, still more unreasonable and dangerous. It
therefore seemed necessary to curb his insolence, and not allow it to
increase till it became incorrigible; and that if the Florentines, from
fear or any other motive, wished to preserve his friendship, they must
pay him themselves. Cosmo returned without having effected any part of
his object.

The Florentines used the weightiest arguments they could adopt to
prevent the count from quitting the service of the League, a course he
was himself reluctant to follow, but his desire to conclude the marriage
so embarrassed him, that any trivial accident would have been sufficient
to determine his course, as indeed shortly happened. The count had
left his territories in La Marca to the care of Il Furlano, one of his
principal condottieri, who was so far influenced by the duke as to
take command under him, and quit the count's service. This circumstance
caused the latter to lay aside every idea but that of his own safety,
and to come to agreement with the duke; among the terms of which compact
was one that he should not be expected to interfere in the affairs of
Romagna and Tuscany. The count then urged the Florentines to come to
terms with the Lucchese, and so convinced them of the necessity of this,
that seeing no better course to adopt, they complied in April, 1438, by
which treaty the Lucchese retained their liberty, and the Florentines
Monte Carlo and a few other fortresses. After this, being full
of exasperation, they despatched letters to every part of Italy,
overcharged with complaints, affecting to show that since God and men
were averse to the Lucchese coming under their dominion, they had made
peace with them. And it seldom happens that any suffer so much for the
loss of their own lawful property as they did because they could not
obtain the possessions of others.

Though the Florentines had now so many affairs in hand, they did not
allow the proceedings of their neighbors to pass unnoticed, or neglect
the decoration of their city. As before observed, Niccolo Fortebraccio
was dead. He had married a daughter of the Count di Poppi, who, at
the decease of his son-in-law, held the Borgo San Sepolcro, and other
fortresses of that district, and while Niccolo lived, governed them in
his name. Claiming them as his daughter's portion, he refused to give
them up to the pope, who demanded them as property held of the church,
and who, upon his refusal, sent the patriarch with forces to take
possession of them. The count, finding himself unable to sustain the
attack, offered them to the Florentines, who declined them; but the pope
having returned to Florence, they interceded with him in the count's
behalf. Difficulties arising, the patriarch attacked the Casentino, took
Prato Vecchio, and Romena, and offered them also to the Florentines, who
refused them likewise, unless the pope would consent they should restore
them to the count, to which, after much hesitation, he acceded, on
condition that the Florentines should prevail with the Count di Poppi
to restore the Borgo to him. The pope was thus satisfied, and the
Florentines having so far completed the building of their cathedral
church of Santa Reparata, which had been commenced long ago, as to
enable them to perform divine service in it, requested his holiness
to consecrate it. To this the pontiff willingly agreed, and the
Florentines, to exhibit the wealth of the city and the splendor of the
edifice, and do greater honor to the pope, erected a platform from
Santa Maria Novella, where he resided, to the cathedral he was about to
consecrate, six feet in height and twelve feet wide, covered with rich
drapery, for the accommodation of the pontiff and his court, upon which
they proceeded to the building, accompanied by those civic magistrates,
and other officers who were appointed to take part in the procession.
The usual ceremonies of consecration having been completed, the pope, to
show his affection for the city, conferred the honor of knighthood upon
Giuliano Davanzati, their Gonfalonier of Justice, and a citizen of the
highest reputation; and the Signory, not to appear less gracious than
the pope, granted to the new created knight the government of Pisa for
one year.

There were at that time certain differences between the Roman and the
Greek churches, which prevented perfect conformity in divine service;
and at the last council of Bâle, the prelates of the Western church
having spoken at great length upon the subject, it was resolved that
efforts should be made to bring the emperor and the Greek prelates to
the council at Bâle, to endeavor to reconcile the Greek church with the
Roman. Though this resolution was derogatory to the majesty of the Greek
empire, and offensive to its clergy, yet being then oppressed by the
Turks, and fearing their inability for defense, in order to have a
better ground for requesting assistance, they submitted; and therefore,
the emperor, the patriarch, with other prelates and barons of Greece,
to comply with the resolution of the council, assembled at Bâle, came
to Venice; but being terrified by the plague then prevailing, it was
resolved to terminate their differences at Florence. The Roman and Greek
prelates having held a conference during several days, in which many
long discussions took place, the Greeks yielded, and agreed to adopt the
ritual of the church of Rome.

New wars in Italy--Niccolo Piccinino, in concert with the duke of
Milan, deceives the pope, and takes many places from the church--Niccolo
attacks the Venetians--Fears and precautions of the Florentines--The
Venetians request assistance of the Florentines and of Sforza--League
against the duke of Milan--The Florentines resolve to send the count to
assist the Venetians--Neri di Gino Capponi at Venice--His discourse to
the senate--Extreme joy of the Venetians.

Peace being restored between the Lucchese and Florentines, and the duke
and the count having become friends, hopes were entertained that the
arms of Italy would be laid aside, although those in the kingdom of
Naples, between René of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon, could find repose
only by the ruin of one party or the other. And though the pope was
dissatisfied with the loss of so large a portion of his territories,
and the ambition of the duke and the Venetians was obvious, still it was
thought that the pontiff, from necessity, and the others from weariness,
would be advocates of peace. However, a different state of feeling
prevailed, for neither the duke nor the Venetians were satisfied with
their condition; so that hostilities were resumed, and Lombardy and
Tuscany were again harassed by the horrors of war. The proud mind of
the duke could not endure that the Venetians should possess Bergamo and
Brescia, and he was still further annoyed, by hearing, that they were
constantly in arms, and in the daily practice of annoying some portion
of his territories. He thought, however, that he should not only be able
to restrain them, but to recover the places he had lost, if the pope,
the Florentines, and the count could be induced to forego the Venetian
alliance. He therefore resolved to take Romagna from the pontiff,
imagining that his holiness could not injure him, and that the
Florentines, finding the conflagration so near, either for their own
sake would refrain from interference, or if they did not, could not
conveniently attack him. The duke was also aware of the resentment
of the Florentines against the Venetians, on account of the affair of
Lucca, and he therefore judged they would be the less eager to take
arms against him on their behalf. With regard to the Count Francesco,
he trusted that their new friendship, and the hope of his alliance would
keep him quiet. To give as little color as possible for complaint, and
to lull suspicion, particularly, because in consequence of his treaty
with the count, the latter could not attack Romagna, he ordered Niccolo
Piccinino, as if instigated by his own ambition to do so.

When the agreement between the duke and the count was concluded, Niccolo
was in Romagna, and in pursuance of his instructions from the duke,
affected to be highly incensed, that a connection had been established
between him and the count, his inveterate enemy. He therefore withdrew
himself and his forces to Camurata, a place between Furli and Ravenna,
which he fortified, as if designing to remain there some time, or till a
new enterprise should present itself. The report of his resentment being
diffused, Niccolo gave the pope to understand how much the duke was
under obligation to him, and how ungrateful he proved; and he was
persuaded that, possessing nearly all the arms of Italy, under the
two principal generals, he could render himself sole ruler: but if
his holiness pleased, of the two principal generals whom he fancied
he possessed, one would become his enemy, and the other be rendered
useless; for, if money were provided him, and he were kept in pay, he
would attack the territories held of the church by the count, who being
compelled to look to his own interests, could not subserve the ambition
of Filippo. The pope giving entire credence to this representation,
on account of its apparent reasonableness, sent Niccolo five thousand
ducats and loaded him with promises of states for himself and his
children. And though many informed him of the deception, he could not
give credit to them, nor would he endure the conversation of any who
seemed to doubt the integrity of Niccolo's professions. The city of
Ravenna was held for the church by Ostasio da Polenta. Niccolo finding
further delay would be detrimental, since his son Francesco had, to the
pope's great dishonor, pillaged Spoleto, determined to attack Ravenna,
either because he judged the enterprise easy, or because he had a secret
understanding with Ostasio, for in a few days after the attack, the
place capitulated. He then took Bologna, Imola, and Furli; and (what
is worthy of remark) of twenty fortresses held in that country for the
pope, not one escaped falling into his hands. Not satisfied with these
injuries inflicted on the pontiff, he resolved to banter him by his
words as well as ridicule him by his deeds, and wrote, that he had only
done as his holiness deserved, for having unblushingly attempted to
divide two such attached friends as the duke and himself, and for having
dispersed over Italy letters intimating that he had quitted the duke
to take part with the Venetians. Having taken possession of Romagna,
Niccolo left it under the charge of his son, Francesco, and with the
greater part of his troops, went into Lombardy, where joining the
remainder of the duke's forces, he attacked the country about Brescia,
and having soon completely conquered it, besieged the city itself.

The duke, who desired the Venetians to be left defenseless, excused
himself to the pope, the Florentines, and the count, saying, that if the
doings of Niccolo were contrary to the terms of the treaty, they were
equally contrary to his wishes, and by secret messengers, assured them
that when an occasion presented itself, he would give them a convincing
proof that they had been performed in disobedience to his instructions.
Neither the count nor the Florentines believed him, but thought, with
reason, that these enterprises had been carried on to keep them at
bay, till he had subdued the Venetians, who, being full of pride, and
thinking themselves able alone to resist the duke, had not deigned to
ask for any assistance, but carried on the war under their captain,
Gattamelata.

Count Francesco would have wished, with the consent of the Florentines,
to go to the assistance of king René, if the events of Romagna and
Lombardy had not hindered him; and the Florentines would willingly have
consented, from their ancient friendship to the French dynasty, but the
duke was entirely in favor of Alfonso. Each being engaged in wars near
home, refrained from distant undertakings. The Florentines, finding
Romagna occupied with the duke's forces, and the Venetians defeated, as
if foreseeing their own ruin in that of others, entreated the count to
come to Tuscany, where they might consider what should be done to resist
Filippo's power, which was now greater than it had ever before been;
assuring him that if his insolence were not in some way curbed, all the
powers of Italy would soon have to submit to him. The count felt the
force of the fears entertained by the Florentines, but his desire to
secure the duke's alliance kept him in suspense; and the duke, aware
of this desire, gave him the greatest assurance that his hopes would
be realized as shortly as possible, if he abstained from hostilities
against him. As the lady was now of marriageable age, the duke had
frequently made all suitable preparations for the celebration of the
ceremony, but on one pretext or another they had always been wholly set
aside. He now, to give the count greater confidence, added deeds to his
words, and sent him thirty thousand florins, which, by the terms of the
marriage contract, he had engaged to pay.

Still the war in Lombardy proceeded with greater vehemence than ever;
the Venetians constantly suffered fresh losses of territory, and the
fleets they equipped upon the rivers were taken by the duke's forces;
the country around Verona and Brescia was entirely occupied, and the
two cities themselves so pressed, that their speedy fall was generally
anticipated. The marquis of Mantua, who for many years had led the
forces of their republic, quite unexpectedly resigned his command, and
went over to the duke's service. Thus the course which pride prevented
them from adopting at the commencement of the war, fear compelled them
to take during its progress; for knowing there was no help for them but
in the friendship of the Florentines and the count, they began to make
overtures to obtain it, though with shame and apprehension; for they
were afraid of receiving a reply similar to that which they had
given the Florentines, when the latter applied for assistance in the
enterprise against Lucca and the count's affairs. However, they found
the Florentines more easily induced to render aid than they expected, or
their conduct deserved; so much more were the former swayed by hatred of
their ancient enemy, than by resentment of the ingratitude of their
old and habitual friends. Having foreseen the necessity into which the
Venetians must come, they had informed the count that their ruin must
involve his own; that he was deceived if he thought the duke, while
fortune, would esteem him more than if he were in adversity; that the
duke was induced to promise him his daughter by the fear he entertained
of him; that what necessity occasions to be promised, it also causes to
be performed; and it was therefore desirable to keep the duke in that
necessity, which could be done without supporting the power of the
Venetians. Therefore he might perceive, that if the Venetians were
compelled to abandon their inland territories, he would not only lose
the advantages derivable from them, but also those to be obtained from
such as feared them; and that if he considered well the powers of
Italy, he would see that some were poor, and others hostile; that the
Florentines alone were not, as he had often said, sufficient for his
support; so that on every account it was best to keep the Venetians
powerful by land. These arguments, conjoined with the hatred which the
count had conceived against Filippo, by supposing himself duped with
regard to the promised alliance, induced him to consent to a new treaty;
but still he would not consent to cross the Po. The agreement was
concluded in February, 1438; the Venetians agreeing to pay two-thirds of
the expense of the war, the Florentines one-third, and each engaging to
defend the states which the count possessed in La Marca. Nor were these
the only forces of the league, for the lord of Faenza, the sons of
Pandolfo Malatesti da Rimino and Pietro Giampagolo Orsini also joined
them. They endeavored, by very liberal offers, to gain over the marquis
of Mantua, but could not prevail against the friendship and stipend of
the duke; and the lord of Faenza, after having entered into compact with
the league, being tempted by more advantageous terms, went over to him.
This made them despair of being able to effect an early settlement of
the troubles of Romagna.

The affairs of Lombardy were in this condition: Brescia was so closely
besieged by the duke's forces, that constant apprehensions were
entertained of her being compelled by famine to a surrender; while
Verona was so pressed, that a similar fate was expected to await her,
and if one of these cities were lost, all the other preparations for the
war might be considered useless, and the expenses already incurred as
completely wasted. For this there was no remedy, but to send the count
into Lombardy; and to this measure three obstacles presented themselves.
The first was, to induce him to cross the Po, and prosecute the war in
whatever locality might be found most advisable; the second, that the
count being at a distance, the Florentines would be left almost at the
mercy of the duke, who, issuing from any of his fortresses, might with
part of his troops keep the count at bay, and with the rest introduce
into Tuscany the Florentine exiles, whom the existing government already
dreaded; the third was, to determine what route the count should take to
arrive safely in the Paduan territory, and join the Venetian forces. Of
these three difficulties, the second, which particularly regarded the
Florentines, was the most serious; but, knowing the necessity of the
case, and wearied out by the Venetians, who with unceasing importunity
demanded the count, intimating that without him they should abandon all
hope, they resolved to relieve their allies rather than listen to the
suggestions of their own fears. There still remained the question about
the route to be taken, for the safety of which they determined the
Venetians should provide; and as they had sent Neri Capponi to treat
with the count and induce him to cross the Po, they determined that the
same person should also proceed to Venice, in order to make the benefit
the more acceptable to the Signory, and see that all possible security
were given to the passage of the forces.

Neri embarked at Cesena and went to Venice; nor was any prince ever
received with so much honor as he was; for upon his arrival, and the
matters which his intervention was to decide and determine, the safety
of the republic seemed to depend. Being introduced to the senate, and
in presence of the Doge, he said, "The Signory of Florence, most serene
prince, has always perceived in the duke's greatness the source of ruin
both to this republic and our own, and that the safety of both states
depends upon their separate strength and mutual confidence. If such had
been the opinion of this illustrious Signory, we should ourselves have
been in better condition, and your republic would have been free from
the dangers that now threaten it. But as at the proper crisis you
withheld from us confidence and aid, we could not come to the relief of
your distress, nor could you, being conscious of this, freely ask us;
for neither in your prosperity nor adversity have you clearly perceived
our motives. You have not observed, that those whose deeds have once
incurred our hatred, can never become entitled to our regard; nor can
those who have once merited our affection ever after absolutely cancel
their claim. Our attachment to your most serene Signory is well known to
you all, for you have often seen Lombardy filled with our forces and
our money for your assistance. Our hereditary enmity to Filippo and his
house is universally known, and it is impossible that love or hatred,
strengthened by the growth of years, can be eradicated from our minds
by any recent act either of kindness or neglect. We have always thought,
and are still of the same opinion, that we might now remain neutral,
greatly to the duke's satisfaction, and with little hazard to ourselves;
for if by your ruin he were to become lord of Lombardy, we should still
have sufficient influence in Italy in free us from any apprehension on
our own account; for every increase of power and territory augments
that animosity and envy, from which arise wars and the dismemberment
of states. We are also aware what heavy expenses and imminent perils we
should avoid, by declining to involve ourselves in these disputes;
and how easily the field of battle may be transferred from Lombardy to
Tuscany, by our interference in your behalf. Yet all these apprehensions
are at once overborne by our ancient affection for the senate and people
of Venice, and we have resolved to come to your relief with the same
zeal with which we should have armed in our own defense, had we been
attacked. Therefore, the senate of Florence, judging it primarily
necessary to relieve Verona and Brescia, and thinking this impossible
without the count, have sent me, in the first instance, to persuade
him to pass into Lombardy, and carry on the war wherever it may be most
needful; for you are aware he is under no obligation to cross the Po. To
induce him to do so, I have advanced such arguments as are suggested by
the circumstances themselves, and which would prevail with us. He, being
invincible in arms, cannot be surpassed in courtesy, and the liberality
he sees the Florentines exercise toward you, he has resolved to outdo;
for he is well aware to what dangers Tuscany will be exposed after
his departure, and since we have made your affairs our primary
consideration, he has also resolved to make his own subservient to
yours. I come, therefore, to tender his services, with seven thousand
cavalry and two thousand infantry, ready at once to march against the
enemy, wherever he may be. And I beg of you, so do my lords at Florence
and the count, that as his forces exceed the number he has engaged to
furnish you, out of your liberality, would remunerate him, that he may
not repent of having come to your assistance, nor we, who have prevailed
with him to do so." This discourse of Neri to the senate was listened
to with that profound attention which an oracle might be imagined to
command; and his audience were so moved by it, that they could not
restrain themselves, till the prince had replied, as strict decorum
on such occasions required, but rising from their seats, with uplifted
hands, and most of them with tears in their eyes, they thanked the
Florentines for their generous conduct, and the ambassador for his
unusual dispatch; and promised that time should never cancel the
remembrance of such goodness, either in their own hearts, or their
children's; and that their country, thenceforth, should be common to the
Florentines with themselves.

When their demonstrations of gratitude had subsided, the Venetian
senate, by the aid of Neri di Gino, began to consider the route the
count ought to take, and how to provide him with necessaries. There were
four several roads; one by Ravenna, along the beach, which on account of
its being in many places interrupted by the sea and by marshes, was not
approved. The next was the most direct, but rendered inconvenient by a
tower called the Uccellino, which being held for the duke, it would be
necessary to capture; and to do this, would occupy more time than could
be spared with safety to Verona and Brescia. The third was by the brink
of the lake; but as the Po had overflowed its banks, to pass in this
direction was impossible. The fourth was by the way of Bologna to Ponte
Puledrano, Cento, and Pieve; then between the Bondeno and the Finale
to Ferrara, and thence they might by land or water enter the Paduan
territory, and join the Venetian forces. This route, though attended
with many difficulties, and in some parts liable to be disputed by the
enemy, was chosen as the least objectionable. The count having received
his instructions, commenced his march, and by exerting the utmost
celerity, reached the Paduan territory on the twentieth of June. The
arrival of this distinguished commander in Lombardy filled Venice and
all her dependencies with hope; for the Venetians, who only an instant
before had been in fear for their very existence, began to contemplate
new conquests.

The count, before he made any other attempt, hastened to the relief of
Verona; and to counteract his design, Niccolo led his forces to Soave, a
castle situated between the Vincentino and the Veronese, and entrenched
himself by a ditch that extended from Soave to the marshes of the Adige.
The count, finding his passage by the plain cut off, resolved to proceed
by the mountains, and thus reach Verona, thinking Niccolo would imagine
this way to be so rugged and elevated as to be impracticable, or if
he thought otherwise, he would not be in time to prevent him; so, with
provisions for eight days, he took the mountain path, and with his
forces, arrived in the plain, below Soave. Niccolo had, even upon this
route, erected some bastions for the purpose of preventing him, but they
were insufficient for the purpose; and finding the enemy had, contrary
to his expectations, effected a passage, to avoid a disadvantageous
engagement he crossed to the opposite side of the Adige, and the count
entered Verona without opposition.

Having happily succeeded in his first project, that of relieving Verona,
the count now endeavored to render a similar service to Brescia. This
city is situated so close to the Lake of Garda, that although besieged
by land, provisions may always be sent into it by water. On this account
the duke had assembled a large force in the immediate vicinity of the
lake, and at the commencement of his victories occupied all the places
which by its means might relieve Brescia. The Venetians also had galleys
upon the lake, but they were unequal to a contest with those of the
duke. The count therefore deemed it advisable to aid the Venetian fleet
with his land forces, by which means he hoped to obtain without much
difficulty those places which kept Brescia in blockade. He therefore
encamped before Bardolino, a fortress situated upon the lake, trusting
that after it was taken the others would surrender. But fortune opposed
this design, for a great part of his troops fell sick; so, giving up
the enterprise, he went to Zevio, a Veronese castle, in a healthy and
plentiful situation. Niccolo, upon the count's retreat, not to let slip
an opportunity of making himself master of the lake, left his camp at
Vegasio, and with a body of picked men took the way thither, attacked
the Venetian fleet with the utmost impetuosity, and took nearly the
whole of it. By this victory almost all the fortresses upon the lake
fell into his hands.

The Venetians, alarmed at this loss, and fearing that in consequence
of it Brescia would surrender, solicited the count, by letters and
messengers, to go to its relief; and he, perceiving that all hope of
rendering assistance from the lake was cut off, and that to attempt
an approach by land, on account of the ditches, bastions, and other
defenses erected by Niccolo, was marching to certain destruction,
determined that as the passage by the mountains had enabled him to
relieve Verona, it should also contribute to the preservation of
Brescia. Having taken this resolution, the count left Zevio, and by way
of the Val d'Acri went to the Lake of St. Andrea, and thence to Torboli
and Peneda, upon the Lake of Garda. He then proceeded to Tenna, and
besieged the fortress, which it was necessary to occupy before he could
reach Brescia.

Niccolo, on being acquainted with the count's design, led his army to
Peschiera. He then, with the marquis of Mantua and a chosen body of men,
went to meet him, and coming to an engagement, was routed, his people
dispersed, and many of them taken, while others fled to the fleet, and
some to the main body of his army. It was now nightfall, and Niccolo
had escaped to Tenna, but he knew that if he were to remain there till
morning, he must inevitably fall into the enemy's hands; therefore, to
avoid a catastrophe which might be regarded as almost fatal, he resolved
to make a dangerous experiment. Of all his attendants he had only with
him a single servant, a Dutchman, of great personal strength, and who
had always been devotedly attached to him. Niccolo induced this man
to take him upon his shoulders in a sack, as if he had been carrying
property of his master's, and to bear him to a place of security. The
enemy's lines surrounded Tenna, but on account of the previous day's
victory, all was in disorder, and no guard was kept, so that the
Dutchman, disguised as a trooper, passed through them without any
opposition, and brought his master in safety to his own troops.

Had this victory been as carefully improved as it was fortunately
obtained, Brescia would have derived from it greater relief and the
Venetians more permanent advantage; but they, having thoughtlessly let
it slip, the rejoicings were soon over, and Brescia remained in her
former difficulties. Niccolo, having returned to his forces, resolved by
some extraordinary exertion to cancel the impression of his death,
and deprive the Venetians of the change of relieving Brescia. He was
acquainted with the topography of the citadel of Verona, and had learned
from prisoners whom he had taken, that it was badly guarded, and might
be very easily recovered. He perceived at once that fortune presented
him with an opportunity of regaining the laurels he had lately lost, and
of changing the joy of the enemy for their recent victory into sorrow
for a succeeding disaster. The city of Verona is situated in Lombardy,
at the foot of the mountains which divide Italy from Germany, so that
it occupies part both of hill and plain. The river Adige rises in the
valley of Trento, and entering Italy, does not immediately traverse the
country, but winding to the left, along the base of the hills, enters
Verona, and crosses the city, which it divides unequally, giving much
the larger portion to the plain. On the mountain side of the river are
two fortresses, formidable rather from their situation than from their
actual strength, for being very elevated they command the whole place.
One is called San Piero, the other San Felice. On the opposite side of
the Adige, upon the plain, with their backs against the city walls, are
two other fortresses, about a mile distant from each other, one called
the Old the other the New Citadel, and a wall extends between them that
may be compared to a bowstring, of which the city wall is the arc. The
space comprehended within this segment is very populous, and is called
the Borgo of St. Zeno. Niccolo Piccinino designed to capture these
fortresses and the Borgo, and he hoped to succeed without much
difficulty, as well on account of the ordinary negligence of the guard,
which their recent successes would probably increase, as because in
war no enterprise is more likely to be successful than one which by the
enemy is deemed impossible. With a body of picked men, and accompanied
by the marquis of Mantua, he proceeded by night to Verona, silently
scaled the walls, and took the New Citadel: then entering the place with
his troops, he forced the gate of S. Antonio, and introduced the whole
of his cavalry. The Venetian garrison of the Old Citadel hearing an
uproar, when the guards of the New were slaughtered, and again when the
gate was forced, being now aware of the presence of enemies, raised an
alarm, and called the people to arms. The citizens awaking in the
utmost confusion, some of the boldest armed and hastened to the rector's
piazza. In the meantime, Niccolo's forces had pillaged the Borgo of San
Zeno; and proceeding onward were ascertained by the people to be the
duke's forces, but being defenseless they advised the Venetian rectors
to take refuge in the fortresses, and thus save themselves and the
place; as it was more advisable to preserve their lives and so rich a
city for better fortune, than by endeavoring to repel the present evil,
encounter certain death, and incur universal pillage. Upon this the
rectors and all the Venetian party, fled to the fortress of San Felice.
Some of the first citizens, anxious to avoid being plundered by the
troops, presented themselves before Niccolo and the marquis of Mantua,
and begged they would rather take possession of a rich city, with honor
to themselves, than of a poor one to their own disgrace; particularly as
they had not induced either the favor of its former possessors, or
the animosity of its present masters, by self-defense. The marquis and
Niccolo encouraged them, and protected their property to the utmost of
their power during such a state of military license. As they felt sure
the count would endeavor to recover the city, they made every possible
exertion to gain possession of the fortresses, and those they could not
seize they cut off from the rest of the place by ditches and barricades,
so that the enemy might be shut out.

The Count Francesco was with his army at Tenna; and when the report was
first brought to him he refused to credit it; but being assured of
the fact by parties whom it would have been ridiculous to doubt, he
resolved, by the exertion of uncommon celerity, to repair the evil
negligence had occasioned; and though all his officers advised the
abandonment of Verona and Brescia, and a march to Vicenza, lest he
might be besieged by the enemy in his present situation, he refused, but
resolved to attempt the recovery of Verona. During the consultation, he
turned to the Venetian commissaries and to Bernardo de' Medici, who was
there as commissary for the Florentines, and promised them the recovery
of the place if one of the fortresses should hold out. Having collected
his forces, he proceeded with the utmost speed to Verona. Observing his
approach, Niccolo thought he designed, according to the advice he had
received, to go to Vicenza, but finding him continue to draw near, and
taking the direction of San Felice, he prepared for its defense--though
too late; for the barricades were not completed; his men were dispersed
in quest of plunder, or extorting money from the inhabitants by way of
ransom; and he could not collect them in time to prevent the count's
troops from entering the fortress. They then descended into the city,
which they happily recovered, to Niccolo's disgrace, and with the loss
of great numbers of his men. He himself, with the marquis of Mantua,
first took refuge in the citadel, and thence escaping into the country,
fled to Mantua, where, having assembled the relics of their army, they
hastened to join those who were at the siege of Brescia. Thus in four
days Verona was lost and again recovered from the duke. The count, after
this victory, it being now winter and the weather very severe, having
first with considerable difficulty thrown provisions into Brescia,
went into quarters at Verona, and ordered, that during the cold season,
galleys should be provided at Torboli, that upon the return of spring,
they might be in a condition to proceed vigorously to effect the
permanent relief of Brescia.

The duke, finding the war suspended for a time, the hope he had
entertained of occupying Brescia and Verona annihilated, and the money
and counsels of the Florentines the cause of this, and seeing that
neither the injuries they had received from the Venetians could alienate
them, nor all the promises he had made attach them to himself, he
determined, in order to make them feel more closely the effects of the
course they had adopted, to attack Tuscany; to which he was strenuously
advised by the Florentine exiles and Niccolo. The latter advocated this
from his desire to recover the states of Braccio, and expel the count
from La Marca; the former, from their wish to return home, and each
by suitable arguments endeavored to induce the duke to follow the plan
congenial to their own views. Niccolo argued that he might be sent into
Tuscany, and continue the siege of Brescia; for he was master of
the lake, the fortresses were well provided, and their officers were
qualified to oppose the count should he undertake any fresh enterprise;
which it was not likely he would do without first relieving Brescia, a
thing impossible; and thus the duke might carry on the war in Tuscany,
without giving up his attempts in Lombardy; intimating that the
Florentines would be compelled, as soon as he entered Tuscany, to recall
the count to avoid complete ruin; and whatever course they took, victory
to the duke must be the result. The exiles affirmed, that if Niccolo
with his army were to approach Florence, the people oppressed with
taxes, and wearied out by the insolence of the great, would most
assuredly not oppose him, and pointed out the facility of reaching
Florence; for the way by the Casentino would be open to them, through
the friendship of Rinaldo and the Count di Poppi; and thus the duke,
who was previously inclined to the attempt, was induced by their joint
persuasions to make it. The Venetians, on the other hand, though the
winter was severe, incessantly urged the count to relieve Brescia with
all his forces. The count questioned the possibility of so doing, and
advised them to wait the return of spring, in the meantime strengthening
their fleet as much as possible, and then assist it both by land and
water. This rendered the Venetians dissatisfied; they were dilatory in
furnishing provisions, and consequently many deserted from their army.

The Florentines, being informed of these transactions, became alarmed,
perceiving the war threatening themselves, and the little progress made
in Lombardy. Nor did the suspicion entertained by them of the troops of
the church give them less uneasiness; not that the pope was their enemy,
but because they saw those forces more under the sway of the patriarch,
who was their greatest foe. Giovanni Vitelleschi of Corneto was at first
apostolic notary, then bishop of Recanati, and afterward patriarch of
Alexandria; but at last, becoming a cardinal, he was called Cardinal of
Florence. He was bold and cunning; and, having obtained great influence,
was appointed to command all the forces of the church, and conduct all
the enterprises of the pontiff, whether in Tuscany, Romagna, the kingdom
of Naples, or in Rome. Hence he acquired so much power over the pontiff,
and the papal troops, that the former was afraid of commanding him, and
the latter obeyed no one else. The cardinal's presence at Rome, when
the report came of Niccolo's design to march into Tuscany, redoubled the
fear of the Florentines; for, since Rinaldo was expelled, he had become
an enemy of the republic, from finding that the arrangements made by his
means were not only disregarded, but converted to Rinaldo's prejudice,
and caused the laying down of arms, which had given his enemies an
opportunity of banishing him. In consequence of this, the government
thought it would be advisable to restore and indemnify Rinaldo, in case
Niccolo came into Tuscany and were joined by him. Their apprehensions
were increased by their being unable to account for Niccolo's departure
from Lombardy, and his leaving one enterprise almost completed, to
undertake another so entirely doubtful; which they could not reconcile
with their ideas of consistency, except by supposing some new design had
been adopted, or some hidden treachery intended. They communicated their
fears to the pope, who was now sensible of his error in having endowed
the cardinal with too much authority.



CHAPTER VI

The pope imprisons the cardinal and assists the Florentines--Difference
of opinion between the count and the Venetians respecting the management
of the war. The Florentines reconcile them--The count wishes to go into
Tuscany to oppose Piccinino, but is prevented by the Venetians--Niccolo
Piccinino in Tuscany--He takes Marradi, and plunders the neighborhood
of Florence--Description of Marradi--Cowardice of Bartolomeo
Orlandini--Brave resistance of Castel San Niccolo--San Niccolo
surrenders--Piccinino attempts to take Cortona, but fails.

While the Florentines were thus anxious, fortune disclosed the means of
securing themselves against the patriarch's malevolence. The republic
everywhere exercised the very closest espionage over epistolary
communication, in order to discover if any persons were plotting against
the state. It happened that letters were intercepted at Monte Pulciano,
which had been written by the patriarch to Niccolo without the pope's
knowledge; and although they were written in an unusual character, and
the sense so involved that no distinct idea could be extracted, the
obscurity itself, and the whole aspect of the matter so alarmed the
pontiff, that he resolved to seize the person of the cardinal, a duty he
committed to Antonio Rido, of Padua, who had the command of the castle
of St. Angelo, and who, after receiving his instructions, soon found
an opportunity of carrying them into effect. The patriarch, having
determined to go into Tuscany, prepared to leave Rome on the following
day, and ordered the castellan to be upon the drawbridge of the fortress
in the morning, for he wished to speak with him as he passed. Antonio
perceived this to be the favorable moment, informed his people what they
were to do, and awaited the arrival of the patriarch upon the bridge,
which adjoined the building, and might for the purpose of security be
raised or lowered as occasion required. The appointed time found him
punctual; and Antonio, having drawn him, as if for the convenience
of conversation, on to the bridge, gave a signal to his men, who
immediately raised it, and in a moment the cardinal, from being a
commander of armies, found himself a prisoner of the castellan. The
patriarch's followers at first began to use threats, but being informed
of the pope's directions they were appeased. The castellan comforting
him with kind words, he replied, that "the great do not make each other
prisoners to let them go again; and that those whom it is proper to
take, it is not well to set free." He shortly afterward died in prison.
The pope appointed Lodovico, patriarch of Aquileia, to command his
troops; and, though previously unwilling to interfere in the wars of
the league and the duke, he was now content to take part in them, and
engaged to furnish four thousand horse and two thousand foot for the
defense of Tuscany.

The Florentines, freed from this cause for anxiety, were still
apprehensive of Niccolo, and feared confusion in the affairs of
Lombardy, from the differences of opinion that existed between the count
and the Venetians. In order the better to become acquainted with the
intentions of the parties, they sent Neri di Gini Capponi and Giuliano
Davanzati to Venice, with instructions to assist in the arrangement of
the approaching campaign; and ordered that Neri, having discovered how
the Venetians were disposed, should proceed to the count, learn
his designs, and induce him to adopt the course that would be most
advantageous to the League. The ambassadors had only reached Ferrara,
when they were told that Niccolo Piccinino had crossed the Po with six
thousand horse. This made them travel with increased speed; and, having
arrived at Venice, they found the Signory fully resolved that Brescia
should be relieved without waiting for the return of spring; for they
said that "the city would be unable to hold out so long, the fleet could
not be in readiness, and that seeing no more immediate relief, she would
submit to the enemy; which would render the duke universally victorious,
and cause them to lose the whole of their inland possessions." Neri then
proceeded to Verona to ascertain the count's opinion, who argued, for
many reasons, that to march to Brescia before the return of spring would
be quite useless, or even worse; for the situation of Brescia, being
considered in conjunction with the season, nothing could be expected to
result but disorder and fruitless toil to the troops; so that, when the
suitable period should arrive, he would be compelled to return to Verona
with his army, to recover from the injuries sustained in the winter, and
provide necessaries for the summer; and thus the time available for the
war would be wasted in marching and countermarching. Orsatto Justiniani
and Giovanni Pisani were deputed on the part of Venice to the count at
Verona, having been sent to consider these affairs, and with them it was
agreed that the Venetians should pay the count ninety thousand ducats
for the coming year, and to each of the soldiers forty ducats; that he
should set out immediately with the whole army and attack the duke, in
order to compel him, for his own preservation, to recall Niccolo into
Lombardy. After this agreement the ambassadors returned to Venice; and
the Venetians, having so large an amount of money to raise, were very
remiss with their commissariat.

In the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino pursued his route, and arrived in
Romagna, where he prevailed upon the sons of Pandolfo Malatesti to
desert the Venetians and enter the duke's service. This circumstance
occasioned much uneasiness in Venice, and still more at Florence;
for they thought that with the aid of the Malatesti they might resist
Niccolo; but finding them gone over to the enemy, they were in fear lest
their captain, Piero Giampagolo Orsini, who was in the territories of
the Malatesti, should be disarmed and rendered powerless. The count also
felt alarmed, for, through Niccolo's presence in Tuscany, he was
afraid of losing La Marca; and, urged by a desire to look after his
own affairs, he hastened to Venice, and being introduced to the Doge,
informed him that the interests of the League required his presence in
Tuscany; for the war ought to be carried on where the leader and forces
of the enemy were, and not where his garrisons and towns were situated;
for when the army is vanquished the war is finished; but to take towns
and leave the armament entire, usually allowed the war to break out
again with greater virulence; that Tuscany and La Marca would be lost if
Niccolo were not vigorously resisted, and that, if lost, there would be
no possibility of the preservation of Lombardy. But supposing the
danger to Lombardy not so imminent, he did not intend to abandon his own
subjects and friends, and that having come into Lombardy as a prince, he
did not intend to return a mere condottiere. To this the Doge replied,
it was quite manifest that, if he left Lombardy, or even recrossed the
Po, all their inland territories would be lost; in that case they were
unwilling to spend any more money in their defense. For it would be
folly to attempt defending a place which must, after all, inevitably
be lost; and that it is less disgraceful and less injurious to lose
dominions only, then to lose both territory and money. That if the loss
of their inland possessions should actually result, it would then be
seen how highly important to the preservation of Romagna and Tuscany
the reputation of the Venetians had been. On these accounts they were of
quite a different opinion from the count; for they saw that whoever was
victor in Lombardy would be so everywhere else, that conquest would be
easily attainable now, when the territories of the duke were left almost
defenseless by the departure of Niccolo, and that he would be ruined
before he could order Niccolo's recall, or provide himself with any
other remedy; that whoever attentively considered these things would
see, that the duke had sent Niccolo into Tuscany for no other reason
than to withdraw the count from his enterprise, and cause the war, which
was now at his own door, to be removed to a greater distance. That if
the count were to follow Niccolo, unless at the instigation of some very
pressing necessity, he would find his plan successful, and rejoice in
the adoption of it; but if he were to remain in Lombardy, and allow
Tuscany to shift for herself, the duke would, when too late, see the
imprudence of his conduct, and find that he had lost his territories in
Lombardy and gained nothing in Tuscany. Each party having spoken, it
was determined to wait a few days to see what would result from the
agreement of the Malatesti with Niccolo; whether the Florentines could
avail themselves of Piero Giampagolo, and whether the pope intended to
join the League with all the earnestness he had promised. Not many
days after these resolutions were adopted, it was ascertained that the
Malatesti had made the agreement more from fear than any ill-will toward
the League; that Piero Giampagolo had proceeded with his force toward
Tuscany, and that the pope was more disposed than ever to assist
them. This favorable intelligence dissipated the count's fears, and he
consented to remain in Lombardy, and that Neri Capponi should return
to Florence with a thousand of his own horse, and five hundred from the
other parties. It was further agreed, that if the affairs of Tuscany
should require the count's presence, Neri should write to him, and he
would proceed thither to the exclusion of every other consideration.
Neri arrived at Florence with his forces in April, and Giampagolo joined
them the same day.

In the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino, the affairs of Romagna being
settled, purposed making a descent into Tuscany, and designing to go by
the mountain passes of San Benedetto and the valley of Montone, found
them so well guarded by the contrivance of Niccolo da Pisa, that his
utmost exertions would be useless in that direction. As the Florentines,
upon this sudden attack, were unprovided with troops and officers, they
had sent into the defiles of these hills many of their citizens,
with infantry raised upon the emergency to guard them, among whom was
Bartolomeo Orlandini, a cavaliere, to whom was intrusted the defense
of the castle of Marradi and the adjacent passes. Niccolo Piccinino,
finding the route by San Benedetto impracticable, on account of the
bravery of its commander, thought the cowardice of the officer who
defended that of Marradi would render the passage easy. Marradi is a
castle situated at the foot of the mountains which separate Tuscany from
Romagna; and, though destitute of walls, the river, the mountains, and
the inhabitants, make it a place of great strength; for the peasantry
are warlike and faithful, and the rapid current undermining the banks
has left them of such tremendous height that it is impossible to
approach it from the valley if a small bridge over the stream be
defended; while on the mountain side the precipices are so steep and
perpendicular as to render it almost impregnable. In spite of these
advantages, the pusillanimity of Bartolomeo Orlandini rendered the men
cowardly and the fortress untenable; for as soon as he heard of the
enemy's approach he abandoned the place, fled with all his forces, and
did not stop till he reached the town of San Lorenzo. Niccolo, entering
the deserted fortress, wondered it had not been defended, and, rejoicing
over his acquisition, descended into the valley of the Mugello, where
he took some castles, and halted with his army at Pulicciano. Thence he
overran the country as far as the mountains of Fiesole; and his audacity
so increased that he crossed the Arno, plundering and destroying
everything to within three miles of Florence.

The Florentines, however, were not dismayed. Their first concern was
to give security to the government, for which they had no cause for
apprehension, so universal was the good will of the people toward Cosmo;
and besides this, they had restricted the principal offices to a few
citizens of the highest class, who with their vigilance would have kept
the populace in order, even if they had been discontented or desirous of
change. They also knew by the compact made in Lombardy what forces
Neri would bring with him, and expected the troops of the pope. These
prospects sustained their courage till the arrival of Neri di Gino, who,
on account of the disorders and fears of the city, determined to set out
immediately and check Niccolo. With the cavalry he possessed, and a body
of infantry raised entirely from the people, he recovered Remole from
the hands of the enemy, where having encamped, he put a stop to all
further depredations, and gave the inhabitants hopes of repelling
the enemy from the neighborhood. Niccolo finding that, although the
Florentines were without troops, no disturbance had arisen, and learning
what entire composure prevailed in the city, thought he was wasting
time, and resolved to undertake some other enterprise to induce them to
send forces after him, and give him a chance of coming to an engagement,
by means of which, if victorious, he trusted everything would succeed to
his wishes.

Francesco, Count di Poppi, was in the army of Niccolo, having deserted
the Florentines, with whom he was in league, when the enemy entered the
Mugello; and though with the intention of securing him as soon as they
had an idea of his design, they increased his appointments, and made him
commissary over all the places in his vicinity; still, so powerful is
the attachment to party, that no benefit or fear could eradicate the
affection he bore toward Rinaldo and the late government; so that as
soon as he knew Niccolo was at hand he joined him, and with the utmost
solicitude entreated him to leave the city and pass into the Casentino,
pointing out to him the strength of the country, and how easily he might
thence harass his enemies. Niccolo followed his advice, and arriving
in the Casentino, took Romena and Bibbiena, and then pitched his camp
before Castel San Niccolo. This fortress is situated at the foot of the
mountains which divide the Casentino from the Val d'Arno; and being in
an elevated situation, and well garrisoned, it was difficult to take,
though Niccolo, with catapults and other engines, assailed it without
intermission. The siege had continued more than twenty days, during
which the Florentines had collected all their forces, having assembled
under several leaders, three thousand horse, at Fegghine, commanded by
Piero Giampagolo Orsini, their captain, and Neri Capponi and Bernardo
de' Medici, commissaries. Four messengers, from Castel San Niccolo, were
sent to them to entreat succor. The commissaries having examined the
site, found it could not be relieved, except from the Alpine regions,
in the direction of the Val d'Arno, the summit of which was more easily
attainable by the enemy than by themselves, on account of their greater
proximity, and because the Florentines could not approach without
observation; so that it would be making a desperate attempt, and might
occasion the destruction of the forces. The commissaries, therefore,
commended their fidelity, and ordered that when they could hold out no
longer, they should surrender. Niccolo took the fortress after a siege
of thirty-two days; and the loss of so much time, for the attainment
of so small an advantage, was the principle cause of the failure of his
expedition; for had he remained with his forces near Florence, he would
have almost deprived the government of all power to compel the citizens
to furnish money: nor would they so easily have assembled forces and
taken other precautions, if the enemy had been close upon them, as
they did while he was at a distance. Besides this, many would have been
disposed to quiet their apprehensions of Niccolo, by concluding a peace;
particularly, as the contest was likely to be of some duration. The
desire of the Count di Poppi to avenge himself on the inhabitants of
San Niccolo, long his enemies, occasioned his advice to Piccinino, who
adopted it for the purpose of pleasing him; and this caused the ruin
of both. It seldom happens, that the gratification of private feelings,
fails to be injurious to the general convenience.

Niccolo, pursuing his good fortune, took Rassina and Chiusi. The Count
di Poppi advised him to halt in these parts, arguing that he might
divide his people between Chiusi, Caprese, and the Pieve, render himself
master of this branch of the Apennines, and descend at pleasure into the
Casentino, the Val d'Arno, the Val di Chiane, or the Val di Tavere,
as well as be prepared for every movement of the enemy. But Niccolo,
considering the sterility of these places, told him, "his horses could
not eat stones," and went to the Borgo San Sepolcro, where he was
amicably received, but found that the people of Citta di Castello, who
were friendly to the Florentines, could not be induced to yield to his
overtures. Wishing to have Perugia at his disposal, he proceeded
thither with forty horse, and being one of her citizens, met with a kind
reception. But in a few days he became suspected, and having attempted
unsuccessfully to tamper with the legate and people of Perugia, he took
eight thousand ducats from them, and returned to his army. He then set
on foot secret measures, to seduce Cortona from the Florentines, but
the affair being discovered, his attempts were fruitless. Among the
principal citizens was Bartolomeo di Senso, who being appointed to the
evening watch of one of the gates, a countryman, his friend, told him,
that if he went he would be slain. Bartolomeo, requesting to know what
was meant, he became acquainted with the whole affair, and revealed it
to the governor of the place, who, having secured the leaders of the
conspiracy, and doubled the guards at the gates, waited till the time
appointed for the coming of Niccolo, who finding his purpose discovered,
returned to his encampment.



CHAPTER VII

Brescia relieved by Sforza--His other victories--Piccinino is
recalled into Lombardy--He endeavors to bring the Florentines to an
engagement--He is routed before Anghiari--Serious disorders in the
camp of the Florentines after the victory--Death of Rinaldo degli
Albizzi--His character--Neri Capponi goes to recover the Casentino--The
Count di Poppi surrenders--His discourse upon quitting his possessions.

While these events were taking place in Tuscany, so little to the
advantage of the duke, his affairs in Lombardy were in a still worse
condition. The Count Francesco, as soon as the season would permit, took
the field with his army, and the Venetians having again covered the lake
with their galleys, he determined first of all to drive the duke from
the water; judging, that this once effected, his remaining task would be
easy. He therefore, with the Venetian fleet, attacked that of the duke,
and destroyed it. His land forces took the castles held for Filippo,
and the ducal troops who were besieging Brescia, being informed of
these transactions, withdrew; and thus, the city, after standing a three
years' siege, was at length relieved. The count then went in quest
of the enemy, whose forces were encamped before Soncino, a fortress
situated upon the River Oglio; these he dislodged and compelled to
retreat to Cremona, where the duke again collected his forces, and
prepared for his defense. But the count constantly pressing him more
closely, he became apprehensive of losing either the whole, or the
greater part, of his territories; and perceiving the unfortunate step
he had taken, in sending Niccolo into Tuscany, in order to correct his
error, he wrote to acquaint him with what had transpired, desiring him,
with all possible dispatch, to leave Tuscany and return to Lombardy.

In the meantime, the Florentines, under their commissaries, had drawn
together their forces, and being joined by those of the pope, halted at
Anghiari, a castle placed at the foot of the mountains that divide the
Val di Tavere from the Val di Chiane, distant four miles from the
Borgo San Sepolcro, on a level road, and in a country suitable for the
evolutions of cavalry or a battlefield. As the Signory had heard of the
count's victory and the recall of Niccolo, they imagined that without
again drawing a sword or disturbing the dust under their horses' feet,
the victory was their own, and the war at an end, they wrote to the
commissaries, desiring them to avoid an engagement, as Niccolo could
not remain much longer in Tuscany. These instructions coming to the
knowledge of Piccinino, and perceiving the necessity of his speedy
return, to leave nothing unattempted, he determined to engage the enemy,
expecting to find them unprepared, and not disposed for battle. In this
determination he was confirmed by Rinaldo, the Count di Poppi, and other
Florentine exiles, who saw their inevitable ruin in the departure of
Niccolo, and hoped, that if he engaged the enemy, they would either
be victorious, or vanquished without dishonor. This resolution being
adopted, Niccolo led his army, unperceived by the enemy, from Citta di
Castello to the Borgo, where he enlisted two thousand men, who, trusting
the general's talents and promises, followed him in hope of plunder.
Niccolo then led his forces in battle array toward Anghiari, and
had arrived within two miles of the place, when Micheletto Attendulo
observed great clouds of dust, and conjecturing at once, that it must
be occasioned by the enemy's approach, immediately called the troops to
arms. Great confusion prevailed in the Florentine camp, for the ordinary
negligence and want of discipline were now increased by their presuming
the enemy to be at a distance, and they were more disposed to fight than
to battle; so that everyone was unarmed, and some wandering from the
camp, either led by their desire to avoid the excessive heat, or in
pursuit of amusement. So great was the diligence of the commissaries and
of the captain, that before the enemy's arrival, the men were mounted
and prepared to resist their attack; and as Micheletto was the first to
observe their approach, he was also first armed and ready to meet them,
and with his troops hastened to the bridge which crosses the river at a
short distance from Anghiari. Pietro Giampagolo having previous to the
surprise, filled up the ditches on either side of the road, and leveled
the ground between the bridge and Anghiari, and Micheletto having taken
his position in front of the former, the legate and Simoncino, who led
the troops of the church, took post on the right, and the commissaries
of the Florentines, with Pietro Giampagolo, their captain, on the left;
the infantry being drawn up along the banks of the river. Thus, the only
course the enemy could take, was the direct one over the bridge; nor
had the Florentines any other field for their exertions, excepting that
their infantry were ordered, in case their cavalry were attacked in
flank by the hostile infantry, to assail them with their cross bows, and
prevent them from wounding the flanks of the horses crossing the bridge.
Micheletto bravely withstood the enemy's charge upon the bridge; but
Astorre and Francesco Piccinino coming up, with a picked body of men,
attacked him so vigorously, that he was compelled to give way, and
was pushed as far as the foot of the hill which rises toward the Borgo
d'Anghiari; but they were in turn repulsed and driven over the bridge,
by the troops that took them in flank. The battle continued two hours,
during which each side had frequent possession of the bridge, and their
attempts upon it were attended with equal success; but on both sides of
the river, the disadvantage of Niccolo was manifest; for when his people
crossed the bridge, they found the enemy unbroken, and the ground
being leveled, they could manoeuvre without difficulty, and the weary
be relieved by such as were fresh. But when the Florentines crossed,
Niccolo could not relieve those that were harassed, on account of the
hindrance interposed by the ditches and embankments on each side of the
road; thus whenever his troops got possession of the bridge, they were
soon repulsed by the fresh forces of the Florentines; but when the
bridge was taken by the Florentines, and they passed over and proceeded
upon the road, Niccolo having no opportunity to reinforce his troops,
being prevented by the impetuosity of the enemy and the inconvenience of
the ground, the rear guard became mingled with the van, and occasioned
the utmost confusion and disorder; they were forced to flee, and
hastened at full speed toward the Borgo. The Florentine troops fell upon
the plunder, which was very valuable in horses, prisoners, and military
stores, for not more than a thousand of the enemy's cavalry reached the
town. The people of the Borgo, who had followed Niccolo in the hope of
plunder, became booty themselves, all of them being taken, and obliged
to pay a ransom. The colors and carriages were also captured. This
victory was much more advantageous to the Florentines than injurious to
the duke; for, had they been conquered, Tuscany would have been his own;
but he, by his defeat, only lost the horses and accoutrements of his
army, which could be replaced without any very serious expense. Nor was
there ever an instance of wars being carried on in an enemy's country
with less injury to the assailants than at this; for in so great a
defeat, and in a battle which continued four hours, only one man died,
and he, not from wounds inflicted by hostile weapons, or any honorable
means, but, having fallen from his horse, was trampled to death.
Combatants then engaged with little danger; being nearly all mounted,
covered with armor, and preserved from death whenever they chose
to surrender, there was no necessity for risking their lives; while
fighting, their armor defended them, and when they could resist no
longer, they yielded and were safe.

This battle, from the circumstances which attended and followed it,
presents a striking example of the wretched state of military discipline
in those times. The enemy's forces being defeated and driven into the
Borgo, the commissaries desired to pursue them, in order to make the
victory complete, but not a single condottiere or soldier would obey,
alleging, as a sufficient reason for their refusal, that they must take
care of the booty and attend to their wounded; and, what is still more
surprising, the next day, without permission from the commissaries, or
the least regard for their commanders, they went to Arezzo, and, having
secured their plunder, returned to Anghiari; a thing so contrary to
military order and all subordination, that the merest shadow of a
regular army would easily and most justly have wrested from them
the victory they had so undeservedly obtained. Added to this, the
men-at-arms, or heavy-armed horse, who had been taken prisoners, whom
the commissaries wished to be detained that they might not rejoin the
enemy, were set at liberty, contrary to their orders. It is astonishing,
that an army so constructed should have sufficient energy to obtain
the victory, or that any should be found so imbecile as to allow such a
disorderly rabble to vanquish them. The time occupied by the Florentine
forces in going and returning from Arezzo, gave Niccolo opportunity of
escaping from the Borgo, and proceeding toward Romagna. Along with him
also fled the Florentine exiles, who, finding no hope of their return
home, took up their abodes in various parts of Italy, each according
to his own convenience. Rinaldo made choice of Ancona; and, to gain
admission to the celestial country, having lost the terrestrial, he
performed a pilgrimage to the holy sepulcher; whence having returned, he
died suddenly while at table at the celebration of the marriage of one
of his daughters; an instance of fortune's favor, in removing him from
the troubles of this world upon the least sorrowful day of his exile.
Rinaldo d'Albizzi appeared respectable under every change of condition;
and would have been more so had he lived in a united city, for many
qualities were injurious to him in a factious community, which in an
harmonious one would have done him honor.

When the forces returned from Arezzo, Niccolo being then gone, the
commissaries presented themselves at the Borgo, the people of which were
willing to submit to the Florentines; but their offer was declined,
and while negotiations were pending, the pope's legate imagined the
commissaries designed to take it from the church. Hard words were
exchanged and hostilities might have ensued between the Florentine
and ecclesiastical forces, if the misunderstanding had continued much
longer; but as it was brought to the conclusion desired by the legate,
peace was restored.

While the affair of the Borgo San Sepolcro was in progress, Niccolo
Piccinino was supposed to have marched toward Rome; other accounts
said La Marca, and hence the legate and the count's forces moved toward
Perugia to relieve La Marca or Rome, as the case might be, and Bernardo
de Medici accompanied them. Neri led the Florentine forces to recover
the Casentino, and pitched his camp before Rassina, which he took,
together with Bibbiena, Prato Vecchio, and Romena. From thence he
proceeded to Poppi and invested it on two sides with his forces, in one
direction toward the plain of Certomondo, in the other upon the hill
extending to Fronzole. The count finding himself abandoned to his fate,
had shut himself up in Poppi, not with any hope of assistance, but with
a view to make the best terms he could. Neri pressing him, he offered
to capitulate, and obtained reasonable conditions, namely, security for
himself and family, with leave to take whatever he could carry away, on
condition of ceding his territories and government to the Florentines.
When he perceived the full extent of his misfortune, standing upon the
bridge which crosses the Arno, close to Poppi, he turned to Neri in
great distress, and said, "Had I well considered my own position and
the power of the Florentines, I should now have been a friend of the
republic and congratulating you on your victory, not an enemy compelled
to supplicate some alleviation of my woe. The recent events which to you
bring glory and joy, to me are full of wretchedness and sorrow. Once
I possessed horses, arms, subjects, grandeur and wealth: can it be
surprising that I part with them reluctantly? But as you possess both
the power and the inclination to command the whole of Tuscany, we must
of necessity obey you; and had I not committed this error, my misfortune
would not have occurred, and your liberality could not have been
exercised; so, that if you were to rescue me from entire ruin, you would
give the world a lasting proof of your clemency. Therefore, let your
pity pass by my fault, and allow me to retain this single house to
leave to the descendants of those from whom your fathers have received
innumerable benefits." To this Neri replied: "That his having expected
great results from men who were capable of doing only very little, had
led him to commit so great a fault against the republic of Florence;
that, every circumstance considered, he must surrender all those places
to the Florentines, as an enemy, which he was unwilling to hold as a
friend: that he had set such an example, as it would be most highly
impolitic to encourage; for, upon a change of fortune, it might injure
the republic, and it was not himself they feared, but his power while
lord of the Casentino. If, however, he could live as a prince in
Germany, the citizens would be very much gratified; and out of love
to those ancestors of whom he had spoken, they would be glad to assist
him." To this, the count, in great anger, replied: "He wished the
Florentines at a much greater distance." Attempting no longer to
preserve the least urbanity of demeanor, he ceded the place and all
its dependencies to the Florentines, and with his treasure, wife, and
children, took his departure, mourning the loss of a territory which his
forefathers had held during four hundred years. When all these victories
were known at Florence, the government and people were transported
with joy. Benedetto de' Medici, finding the report of Niccolo having
proceeded either to Rome or to La Marca, incorrect, returned with his
forces to Neri, and they proceeded together to Florence, where the
highest honors were decreed to them which it was customary with the city
to bestow upon her victorious citizens, and they were received by the
Signory, the Capitani di Parte, and the whole city, in triumphal pomp.

CHAPTER I

Reflections on the object of war and the use of victory--Niccolo
reinforces his army--The duke of Milan endeavors to recover the services
of Count Francesco Sforza--Suspicions of the Venetians--They acquire
Ravenna--The Florentines purchase the Borgo San Sepolcro of the
pope--Piccinino makes an excursion during the winter--The count besieged
in his camp before Martinengo--The insolence of Niccolo Piccinino--The
duke in revenge makes peace with the league--Sforza assisted by the
Florentines.

Those who make war have always and very naturally designed to enrich
themselves and impoverish the enemy; neither is victory sought or
conquest desirable, except to strengthen themselves and weaken the
enemy. Hence it follows, that those who are impoverished by victory or
debilitated by conquest, must either have gone beyond, or fallen short
of, the end for which wars are made. A republic or a prince is enriched
by the victories he obtains, when the enemy is crushed and possession
is retained of the plunder and ransom. Victory is injurious when the foe
escapes, or when the soldiers appropriate the booty and ransom. In such
a case, losses are unfortunate, and conquests still more so; for the
vanquished suffers the injuries inflicted by the enemy, and the victor
those occasioned by his friends, which being less justifiable, must
cause the greater pain, particularly from a consideration of his being
thus compelled to oppress his people by an increased burden of taxation.
A ruler possessing any degree of humanity, cannot rejoice in a victory
that afflicts his subjects. The victories of the ancient and well
organized republics, enabled them to fill their treasuries with gold and
silver won from their enemies, to distribute gratuities to the people,
reduce taxation, and by games and solemn festivals, disseminate
universal joy. But the victories obtained in the times of which we
speak, first emptied the treasury, and then impoverished the people,
without giving the victorious party security from the enemy. This arose
entirely from the disorders inherent in their mode of warfare; for the
vanquished soldiery, divesting themselves of their accoutrements, and
being neither slain nor detained prisoners, only deferred a renewed
attack on the conqueror, till their leader had furnished them with arms
and horses. Besides this, both ransom and booty being appropriated
by the troops, the victorious princes could not make use of them for
raising fresh forces, but were compelled to draw the necessary means
from their subjects' purses, and this was the only result of victory
experienced by the people, except that it diminished the ruler's
reluctance to such a course, and made him less particular about his mode
of oppressing them. To such a state had the practice of war been
brought by the sort of soldiery then on foot, that the victor and the
vanquished, when desirous of their services, alike needed fresh supplies
of money; for the one had to re-equip them, and the other to bribe
them; the vanquished could not fight without being remounted, and the
conquerors would not take the field without a new gratuity. Hence it
followed, that the one derived little advantage from the victory, and
the other was the less injured by defeat; for the routed party had to be
re-equipped, and the victorious could not pursue his advantage.

From this disorderly and perverse method of procedure, it arose, that
before Niccolo's defeat became known throughout Italy, he had again
reorganized his forces, and harassed the enemy with greater vigor than
before. Hence, also, it happened, that after his disaster at Tenna, he
so soon occupied Verona: that being deprived of his army at Verona, he
was shortly able to appear with a large force in Tuscany; that being
completely defeated at Anghiari, before he reached Tuscany, he was more
powerful in the field than ever. He was thus enabled to give the duke of
Milan hopes of defending Lombardy, which by his absence appeared to
be lost; for while Niccolo spread consternation throughout Tuscany,
disasters in the former province so alarmed the duke, that he was afraid
his utter ruin would ensue before Niccolo, whom he had recalled, could
come to his relief, and check the impetuous progress of the count. Under
these impressions, the duke, to insure by policy that success which he
could not command by arms, had recourse to remedies, which on similar
occasions had frequently served his turn. He sent Niccolo da Esti,
prince of Ferrara, to the count who was then at Peschiera, to persuade
him, "That this war was not to his advantage; for if the duke became
so ruined as to be unable to maintain his position among the states of
Italy, the count would be the first to suffer; for he would cease to be
of importance either with the Venetians or the Florentines; and to
prove the sincerity of his wish for peace, he offered to fulfill the
engagement he had entered into with regard to his daughter, and send her
to Ferrara; so that as soon as peace was established, the union might
take place." The count replied, "That if the duke really wished
for peace, he might easily be gratified, as the Florentines and the
Venetians were equally anxious for it. True, it was, he could with
difficulty credit him, knowing that he had never made peace but from
necessity, and when this no longer pressed him, again desired war.
Neither could he give credence to what he had said concerning the
marriage, having been so repeatedly deceived; yet when peace was
concluded, he would take the advice of his friends upon that subject."

The Venetians, who were sometimes needlessly jealous of their soldiery,
became greatly alarmed at these proceedings; and not without reason.
The count was aware of this, and wishing to remove their apprehensions,
pursued the war with unusual vigor; but his mind had become so unsettled
by ambition, and the Venetians' by jealousy, that little further
progress was made during the remainder of the summer, and upon the
return of Niccolo into Lombardy, winter having already commenced, the
armies withdrew into quarters, the count to Verona, the Florentine
forces to Tuscany, the duke's to Cremona, and those of the pope to
Romagna. The latter, after having been victorious at Anghiari, made an
unsuccessful attack upon Furli and Bologna, with a view to wrest them
from Niccolo Piccinino; but they were gallantly defended by his son
Francesco. However, the arrival of the papal forces so alarmed the
people of Ravenna with the fear of becoming subject to the church, that,
by consent of Ostasio di Polenta their lord, they placed themselves
under the power of the Venetians; who, in return for the territory, and
that Ostasio might never retake by force what he had imprudently given
them, sent him and his son to Candia, where they died. In the course of
these affairs, the pope, notwithstanding the victory at Anghiari, became
so in want of money, that he sold the fortress of Borgo San Sepolcro to
the Florentines for 25,000 ducats.

Affairs being thus situated, each party supposed winter would protect
them from the evils of war, and thought no more of peace. This was
particularly the case with the duke, who, being rendered doubly secure
by the season and by the presence of Niccolo, broke off all attempts to
effect a reconciliation with the count, reorganized Niccolo's forces,
and made every requisite preparation for the future struggle. The count
being informed of this, went to Venice to consult with the senate on the
course to be pursued during the next year. Niccolo, on the other hand,
being quite prepared, and seeing the enemy unprovided, did not await the
return of spring, but crossed the Adda during severe weather, occupied
the whole Brescian territory, except Oddula and Acri, and made
prisoners two thousand horse belonging to Francesco's forces, who had
no apprehension of an attack. But the greatest source of anxiety to the
count, and alarm to the Venetians, was the desertion of his service by
Ciarpellone, one of his principal officers. Francesco, on learning these
matters, immediately left Venice, and, arriving at Brescia, found that
Niccolo, after doing all the mischief he could, had retired to his
quarters; and therefore, finding the war concluded for the present was
not disposed to rekindle it, but rather to use the opportunity afforded
by the season and his enemies, of reorganizing his forces, so as to be
able, when spring arrived, to avenge himself for his former injuries.
To this end he induced the Venetians to recall the forces they had
in Tuscany, in the Florentine service, and to order that to succeed
Gattamelata, who was dead, Micheletto Attendulo should take the command.

On the approach of spring, Niccolo Piccinino was the first to take
the field, and encamped before Cignano, a fortress twelve miles from
Brescia; the count marched to its relief, and the war between them was
conducted in the usual manner. The count, apprehensive for the city of
Bergamo, besieged Martinengo, a castle so situated that the possession
of it would enable him to relieve the former, which was closely pressed
by Niccolo, who, having foreseen that the enemy could impede him only
from the direction of Martinengo, had put the castle into a complete
state of defense, so that the count was obliged to lend his whole
force to the siege. Upon this, Niccolo placed his troops in a situation
calculated to intercept the count's provisions, and fortified himself
with trenches and bastions in such a manner that he could not be
attacked without the most manifest hazard to his assailant. Hence the
besiegers were more distressed than the people of Martinengo whom they
besieged. The count could not hold his position for want of food, nor
quit it without imminent danger; so that the duke's victory appeared
certain, and defeat equally inevitable to the count and the Venetians.

But fortune, never destitute of means to assist her favorites, or to
injure others, caused the hope of victory to operate so powerfully
upon Niccolo Piccinino, and made him assume such a tone of unbounded
insolence, that, losing all respect for himself and the duke, he sent
him word that, having served under his ensign for so long, without
obtaining sufficient land to serve him for a grave, he wished to know
from himself what was to be the reward of his labors; for it was in his
power to make him master of Lombardy, and place all his enemies in
his power; and, as a certain victory ought to be attended by a sure
remuneration, he desired the duke to concede to him the city of
Piacenza, that when weary with his lengthened services he might at
last betake himself to repose. Nor did he hesitate, in conclusion, to
threaten, if his request were not granted, to abandon the enterprise.
This injurious and most insolent mode of proceeding highly offended the
duke, and, on further consideration, he determined rather to let the
expedition altogether fail, than consent to his general's demand. Thus,
what all the dangers he had incurred, and the threats of his enemies,
could not draw from him, the insolent behavior of his friends made him
willing to propose. He resolved to come to terms with the count,
and sent Antonio Guido Buono, of Tortona, to offer his daughter and
conditions of peace, which were accepted with great pleasure by the
count, and also by the colleagues as far as themselves were concerned.
The terms being secretly arranged, the duke sent to command Niccolo
to make a truce with the count for one year; intimating, that being
exhausted with the expense, he could not forego a certain peace for a
doubtful victory. Niccolo was utterly astonished at this resolution,
and could not imagine what had induced the duke to lose such a glorious
opportunity; nor could he surmise that, to avoid rewarding his friends,
he would save his enemies, and therefore to the utmost of his power he
opposed this resolution; and the duke was obliged, in order to induce
his compliance, to threaten that if he did not obey he would give him up
to his soldiers and his enemies. Niccolo submitted, with the feelings
of one compelled to leave country and friends, complaining of his hard
fate, that fortune and the duke were robbing him of the victory over his
enemies. The truce being arranged, the marriage of the duke's daughter,
Bianca, to the count was solemnized, the duke giving Cremona for her
portion. This being over, peace was concluded in November, 1441,
at which Francesco Barbadico and Pagolo Trono were present for the
Venetians, and for the Florentines Agnolo Acciajuoli. Peschiera, Asola,
and Lonato, castles in the Mantuan territory, were assigned to the
Venetians.

The war in Lombardy was concluded; but the dissensions in the kingdom
of Naples continued, and the inability to compose them occasioned the
resumption of those arms which had been so recently laid aside. Alfonso,
of Aragon, had, during these wars, taken from René the whole kingdom
except Naples; so that, thinking he had the victory in his power, he
resolved during the siege of Naples to take Benevento, and his other
possessions in that neighborhood, from the count; and thought he might
easily accomplish this while the latter was engaged in the wars of
Lombardy. Having heard of the conclusion of peace, Alfonso feared the
count would not only come for the purpose of recovering his territories,
but also to favor René; and René himself had hope of his assistance for
the same reason. The latter, therefore, sent to the count, begging he
would come to the relief of a friend, and avenge himself of an enemy.
On the other hand, Alfonso entreated Filippo, for the sake of the
friendship which subsisted between them, to find the count some other
occupation, that, being engaged in greater affairs, he might not have
an opportunity of interfering between them. Filippo complied with this
request, without seeming to be aware that he violated the peace recently
made, so greatly to his disadvantage. He therefore signified to pope
Eugenius, that the present was a favorable opportunity for recovering
the territories which the count had taken from the church; and, that he
might be in a condition to use it, offered him the services of Niccolo
Piccinino, and engaged to pay him during the war; who, since the peace
of Lombardy, had remained with his forces in Romagna. Eugenius eagerly
took the advice, induced by his hatred of the count, and his desire to
recover his lost possessions; feeling assured that, although on a former
occasion he had been duped by Niccolo, it would be improper, now that
the duke interfered, to suspect any deceit; and, joining his forces to
those of Niccolo, he assailed La Marca. The count, astonished at such an
unexpected attack, assembled his troops, and went to meet the enemy. In
the meantime, King Alfonso took possession of Naples, so that the whole
kingdom, except Castelnuova, was in his power. Leaving a strong guard
at Castelnuova René set out and came to Florence, where he was most
honorably received; and having remained a few days, finding he could not
continue the war, he withdrew to Marseilles.

In the meantime, Alfonso took Castelnuova, and the count found himself
assailed in the Marca Inferiore, both by the pope and Niccolo. He
applied to the Venetians and the Florentines for assistance, in men and
money, assuring them that if they did not determine to restrain the pope
and king, during his life, they would soon afterward find their very
existence endangered, for both would join Filippo and divide Italy
among them. The Florentines and Venetians hesitated for a time, both to
consider the propriety of drawing upon themselves the enmity of the pope
and the king, and because they were then engaged in the affairs of the
Bolognese. Annibale Bentivoglio had driven Francesco Piccinino from
Bologna, and for defense against the duke, who favored Francesco, he
demanded and received assistance of the Venetians and Florentines; so
that, being occupied with these matters they could not resolve to assist
the count, but Annibale, having routed Francesco Piccinino, and those
affairs seeming to be settled, they resolved to support him. Designing
however to make sure of the duke, they offered to renew the league with
him, to which he was not averse; for, although he consented that war
should be made against the count, while King René was in arms, yet
finding him now conquered, and deprived of the whole kingdom, he was
not willing that the count should be despoiled of his territories; and
therefore, not only consented that assistance should be given him,
but wrote to Alfonso to be good enough to retire to his kingdom, and
discontinue hostilities against the count; and although reluctantly, yet
in acknowledgment of his obligations to the duke, Alfonso determined to
satisfy him, and withdrew with his forces beyond the Tronto.

Discords of Florence--Jealousy excited against Neri di Gino
Capponi--Baldaccio d'Anghiari murdered--Reform of government in favor
of the Medici--Enterprises of Sforza and Piccinino--Death of Niccolo
Piccinino--End of the war--Disturbances in Bologna--Annibale Bentivoglio
slain by Battista Canneschi, and the latter by the people--Santi,
supposed to be the son of Ercole Bentivoglio, is called to govern
the city of Bologna--Discourse of Cosmo de' Medici to him--Perfidious
designs of the duke of Milan against Sforza--General war in
Italy--Losses of the duke of Milan--The duke has recourse to the count,
who makes peace with him--Offers of the duke and the Venetians to the
count--The Venetians furtively deprive the count of Cremona.

While the affairs of Romagna proceeded thus, the city of Florence
was not tranquil. Among the citizens of highest reputation in the
government, was Neri di Gino Capponi, of whose influence Cosmo de'
Medici had more apprehension than any other; for to the great authority
which he possessed in the city was added his influence with the
soldiery. Having been often leader of the Florentine forces he had won
their affection by his courage and talents; and the remembrance of his
own and his father's victories (the latter having taken Pisa, and he
himself having overcome Niccolo Piccinino at Anghiari) caused him to
be beloved by many, and feared by those who were averse to having
associates in the government. Among the leaders of the Florentine army
was Baldaccio d'Anghiari, an excellent soldier, for in those times there
was not one in Italy who surpassed him in vigor either of body or mind;
and possessing so much influence with the infantry, whose leader he had
always been, many thought they would follow him wherever he chose to
lead them. Baldaccio was the intimate friend of Neri, who loved him for
his talents, of which he had been a constant witness. This excited great
suspicion in the other citizens, who, thinking it alike dangerous either
to discharge or retain him in their service, determined to destroy him,
and fortune seemed to favor their design. Bartolommeo Orlandini was
Gonfalonier of Justice; the same person who was sent to the defense of
Marradi, when Niccolo Piccinino came into Tuscany, as we have related
above, and so basely abandoned the pass, which by its nature was almost
impregnable. So flagrant an instance of cowardice was very offensive
to Baldaccio, who, on many occasions, both by words and letters, had
contributed to make the disgraceful fact known to all. The shame and
vexation of Bartolommeo were extreme, so that of all things he wished to
avenge himself, thinking, with the death of his accuser, to efface the
stain upon his character.

This feeling of Bartolommeo Orlandini was known to other citizens, so
that they easily persuaded him to put Baldaccio to death, and at one
avenge himself, and deliver his country from a man whom they must
either retain at great peril, or discharge to their greater confusion.
Bartolommeo having therefore resolved to murder him, concealed in his
own apartment at the palace several young men, all armed; and Baldaccio,
entering the piazza, whither it was his daily custom to come, to confer
with the magistrates concerning his command, the Gonfalonier sent for
him, and he, without any suspicion, obeyed. Meeting him in the corridor,
which leads to the chambers of the Signory, they took a few turns
together discoursing of his office, when being close to the door of the
apartments in which the assassins were concealed, Bartolommeo gave them
the signal, upon which they rushed out, and finding Baldaccio alone and
unarmed, they slew him, and threw the body out of the window which looks
from the palace toward the dogano, or customhouse. It was thence carried
into the piazza, where the head being severed, it remained the whole day
exposed to the gaze of the people. Baldaccio was married, and had only
one child, a boy, who survived him but a short time; and his wife,
Annalena, thus deprived of both husband and offspring, rejected every
proposal for a second union. She converted her house into a monastery,
to which she withdrew, and, being joined by many noble ladies, lived
in holy seclusion to the end of her days. The convent she founded, and
which is named from her, preserves her story in perpetual remembrance.

This circumstance served to weaken Neri's power, and made him lose both
influence and friends. Nor did this satisfy the citizens who held the
reins of government; for it being ten years since their acquisition of
power, and the authority of the Balia expired, many began to exhibit
more boldness, both in words and deeds, than seemed consistent with
their safety; and the leaders of the party judged, that if they wished
to preserve their influence, some means must be adopted to increase it.
To this end, in 1444 the councils created a new Balia, which reformed
the government, gave authority to a limited number to create the
Signory, re-established the Chancery of Reformations, depriving Filippo
Peruzzi of his office of president in it, and appointing another wholly
under their influence. They prolonged the term of exile to those who
were banished; put Giovanni di Simone Vespucci in prison; deprived the
Accoppiatori of their enemies of the honors of government, and with
them the sons of Piero Baroncelli, the whole of the Seragli, Bartolommeo
Fortini, Francesco Castellani, and many others. By these means they
strengthened their authority and influence, and humbled their enemies,
or those whom they suspected of being so.

Having thus recovered and confirmed their government, they then
turned their attention to external affairs. As observed above, Niccolo
Piccinino was abandoned by King Alfonso, and the count having been
aggrandized by the assistance of the Florentines, attacked and routed
him near Fermo, where, after losing nearly the whole of his troops,
Niccolo fled to Montecchio, which he fortified in such a manner that in
a short time he had again assembled so large an army as enabled him to
make head against the count; particularly as the season was now come for
them to withdraw into quarters. His principal endeavor during the winter
was to collect troops, and in this he was assisted both by the pope and
Alfonso; so that, upon the approach of spring, both leaders took the
field, and Niccolo, being the strongest, reduced the count to extreme
necessity, and would have conquered him if the duke had not contrived to
frustrate his designs. Filippo sent to beg he would come to him with
all speed, for he wished to have a personal interview, that he might
communicate matters of the highest importance. Niccolo, anxious to hear
them, abandoned a certain victory for a very doubtful advantage; and
leaving his son Francesco to command the army, hastened to Milan.
The count being informed of the circumstance, would not let slip the
opportunity of fighting in the absence of Niccolo; and, coming to an
engagement near the castle of Monte Loro, routed the father's forces and
took the son prisoner. Niccolo having arrived at Milan saw that the duke
had duped him, and learning the defeat of his army and the capture of
his son, he died of grief in 1445, at the age of sixty-four, having been
a brave rather than a fortunate leader. He left two sons, Francesco and
Jacopo, who, possessing less talent than their father, were still more
unfortunate; so that the arms of the family became almost annihilated,
while those of Sforza, being favored by fortune, attained augmented
glory. The pope, seeing Niccolo's army defeated and himself dead, having
little hope of assistance from Aragon, sought peace with the count, and,
by the intervention of the Florentines, succeeded. Of La Marca, the pope
only retained Osimo, Fabriano, and Recanati; all the rest remained in
the count's possession.

Peace being restored to La Marca, the whole of Italy would have obtained
repose had it not been disturbed by the Bolognese. There were in Bologna
two very powerful families, the Canneschi and the Bentivogli. Of the
latter, Annibale was the head; of the former, Battista, who, as a means
of confirming their mutual confidence, had contracted family alliances;
but among men who have the same objects of ambition in view, it is
easy to form connections, but difficult to establish friendship. The
Bolognese were in a league with the Venetians and Florentines, which had
been effected by the influence of Annibale, after they had driven
out Francesco Piccinino; and Battista, knowing how earnestly the duke
desired to have the city favorable to him, proposed to assassinate
Annibale, and put Bologna into his power. This being agreed upon, on the
twenty-fifth of June, 1445, he attacked Annibale with his men, and slew
him: and then, with shouts of "the duke, the duke," rode through the
city. The Venetian and Florentine commissaries were in Bologna at the
time, and at first kept themselves within doors; but finding that the
people, instead of favoring the murderers, assembled in the piazza,
armed in great numbers, mourning the death of Annibale, they joined
them; and, assembling what forces they could, attacked the Canneschi,
soon overpowered them, slew part, and drove the remainder out of the
city. Battista, unable to effect his escape, or his enemies his capture,
took refuge in a vault of his house, used for storing grain. The friends
of the Bentivogli, having sought him all day, and knowing he had not
left the city, so terrified his servants, that one of them, a groom,
disclosed the place of his concealment, and being drawn forth in
complete armor he was slain, his body dragged about the streets, and
afterward burned. Thus the duke's authority was sufficient to prompt the
enterprise, but his force was not at hand to support it.

The tumults being settled by the death of Battista, and the flight of
the Canneschi, Bologna still remained in the greatest confusion. There
not being one of the house of Bentivogli of age to govern, Annibale
having left but one son whose name was Giovanni, only six years old,
it was apprehended that disunion would ensue among the Bentivogli,
and cause the return of the Cannecshi, and the ruin both of their own
country and party. While in this state of apprehension, Francesco,
sometime Count di Poppi, being at Bologna, informed the rulers of
the city, that if they wished to be governed by one of the blood of
Annibale, he could tell them of one; and related that about twenty years
ago, Ercole, cousin of Annibale, being at Poppi, became acquainted with
a girl of the castle, of whom was born a son named Santi, whom Ercole,
on many occasions acknowledged to be his own, nor could he deny it,
for whoever knew him and saw the boy, could not fail to observe the
strongest resemblance. The citizens gave credit to the tale, and
immediately sent to Florence to see the young man, and procure of Cosmo
and Neri permission to return with him to Bologna. The reputed father
of Santi was dead, and he lived under the protection of his uncle, whose
name was Antonio da Cascese. Antonio was rich, childless, and a friend
of Neri, to whom the matter becoming known, he thought it ought neither
to be despised nor too hastily accepted; and that it would be best
for Santi and those who had been sent from Bologna, to confer in the
presence of Cosmo. They were accordingly introduced, and Santi was not
merely honored but adored by them, so greatly were they influenced by
the spirit of party. However, nothing was done at the time, except that
Cosmo, taking Santi apart, spoke to him thus: "No one can better advise
you in this matter than yourself; for you have to take that course
to which your own mind prompts you. If you be the son of Ercole
Bentivoglio, you will naturally aspire to those pursuits which are
proper to your family and worthy of your father; but if you be the son
of Agnolo da Cascese, you will remain in Florence, and basely spend the
remainder of your days in some branch of the woolen trade." These words
greatly influenced the youth, who, though he had at first almost refused
to adopt such a course, said, he would submit himself wholly to what
Cosmo and Neri should determine. They, assenting to the request of the
Bolognese, provided suitable apparel, horses, and servants; and in a
few days he was escorted by a numerous cavalcade to Bologna, where the
guardianship of Annibale's son and of the city were placed in his hands.
He conducted himself so prudently, that although all his ancestors had
been slain by their enemies, he lived in peace and died respected by
everyone.

After the death of Niccolo Piccinino and the peace of La Marca, Filippo
wishing to procure a leader of his forces, secretly negotiated with
Ciarpellone, one of the principal captains of Count Francesco, and
arrangements having been made, Ciarpellone asked permission to go to
Milan to take possession of certain castles which had been given him by
Filippo during the late wars. The count suspecting what was in progress,
in order to prevent the duke from accommodating himself at his expense,
caused Ciarpellone to be arrested, and soon afterward put to death;
alleging that he had been detected plotting against him. Filippo was
highly annoyed and indignant, which the Venetians and the Florentines
were glad to observe, for their greatest fear was, that the duke and the
count should become friends.

The duke's anger caused the renewal of war in La Marca. Gismondo
Malatesti, lord of Rimino, being son-in-law of the count, expected to
obtain Pesaro; but the count, having obtained possession, gave it to
his brother, Alessandro. Gismondo, offended at this, was still further
exasperated at finding that Federigo di Montefeltro, his enemy, by the
count's assistance, gained possession of Urbino. He therefore joined the
duke, and solicited the pope and the king to make war against the count,
who, to give Gismondo a taste of the war he so much desired, resolved to
take the initiative, and attacked him immediately. Thus Romagna and La
Marca were again in complete confusion, for Filippo, the king, and the
pope, sent powerful assistance to Gismondo, while the Florentines and
Venetians supplied the count with money, though not with men. Nor was
Filippo satisfied with the war in Romagna, but also desired to take
Cremona and Pontremoli from the count; but Pontremoli was defended by
the Florentines, and Cremona by the Venetians. Thus the war was renewed
in Lombardy, and after several engagements in the Cremonese, Francesco
Piccinino, the leader of the duke's forces, was routed at Casale, by
Micheletto and the Venetian troops. This victory gave the Venetians hope
of obtaining the duke's dominions. They sent a commissary to Cremona,
attacked the Ghiaradadda, and took the whole of it, except Crema. Then
crossing the Adda, they overran the country as far as Milan. Upon this
the duke had recourse to Alfonso, and entreated his assistance, pointing
out the danger his kingdom would incur if Lombardy were to fall into
the hands of the Venetians. Alfonso promised to send him troops, but
apprised him of the difficulties which would attend their passage,
without the permission of the count.

Filippo, driven to extremity, then had recourse to Francesco, and begged
he would not abandon his father-in-law, now that he had become old and
blind. The count was offended with the duke for making war against him;
but he was jealous of the increasing greatness of the Venetians, and
he himself began to be in want of money, for the League supplied him
sparingly. The Florentines, being no longer in fear of the duke, ceased
to stand in need of the count, and the Venetians desired his ruin; for
they thought Lombardy could not be taken from him except by this means;
yet while Filippo sought to gain him over, and offered him the entire
command of his forces, on condition that he should restore La Marca to
the pope and quit the Venetian alliance, ambassadors were sent to him by
that republic, promising him Milan, if they took it, and the perpetual
command of their forces, if he would push the war in La Marca, and
prevent Alfonso from sending troops into Lombardy. The offers of the
Venetians were great, as also were their claims upon him, having begun
the war in order to save him from losing Cremona; while the injuries
received from the duke were fresh in his memory, and his promises had
lost all influence, still the count hesitated; for on the one hand, were
to be considered his obligations to the League, his pledged faith,
their recent services, and his hopes of the future, all which had
their influence on him; on the other, were the entreaties of his
father-in-law, and above all, the bane which he feared would be
concealed under the specious offers of the Venetians, for he doubted
not, that both with regard to Milan and their other promises, if they
were victorious, he would be at their mercy, to which no prudent men
would ever submit if he could avoid it. These difficulties in the way
of his forming a determination, were obviated by the ambition of the
Venetians, who, seeing a chance of occupying Cremona, from secret
intelligence with that city, under a different pretext, sent troops into
its neighborhood; but the affair was discovered by those who commanded
Cremona for the count, and measures were adopted which prevented
its success. Thus without obtaining Cremona, they lost the count's
friendship, who, now being free from all other considerations, joined
the duke.



CHAPTER III

Death of Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan--The Milanese appoint Sforza
their captain--Milan becomes a republic--The pope endeavors to restore
peace to Italy--The Venetians oppose this design--Alfonso attacks the
Florentines--The neighborhood of Piombino becomes the principal
theater of war--Scarcity in the Florentine camp--Disorders occur in
the Neapolitan and Florentine armies--Alfonso sues for peace and is
compelled to retreat--Pavia surrenders to the count--Displeasure of
the Milanese--The count besieges Caravaggio--The Venetians endeavor to
relieve the place--They are routed by the count before Caravaggio.

Pope Eugenius being dead, was succeeded by Nicholas V. The count had his
whole army at Cotignola, ready to pass into Lombardy, when intelligence
was brought him of the death of Filippo, which happened on the last
day of August, 1447. This event greatly afflicted him, for he doubted
whether his troops were in readiness, on account of their arrears of
pay; he feared the Venetians, who were his armed enemies, he having
recently forsaken them and taken part with the duke; he was in
apprehension from Alfonso, his inveterate foe; he had no hope from the
pontiff or the Florentines; for the latter were allies of the Venetians,
and he had seized the territories of the former. However, he resolved to
face his fortune and be guided by circumstances; for it often happens,
that when engaged in business valuable ideas are suggested, which in a
state of inaction would never have occurred. He had great hopes, that if
the Milanese were disposed to defend themselves against the ambition of
the Venetians, they could make use of no other power but his. Therefore,
he proceeded confidently into the Bolognese territory, thence to Modena
and Reggio, halted with his forces upon the Lenza, and sent to offer his
services at Milan. On the death of the duke, part of the Milanese were
inclined to establish a republic; others wished to choose a prince, and
of these, one part favored the count, and another Alfonso. However, the
majority being in favor of freedom, they prevailed over the rest,
and organized a republic, to which many cities of the Duchy refused
obedience; for they, too, desired to live in the enjoyment of their
liberty, and even those who did not embrace such views, refused to
submit to the sovereignty of the Milanese. Lodi and Piacenza surrendered
themselves to the Venetians; Pavia and Parma became free. This confused
state of things being known to the count, he proceeded to Cremona, where
his ambassadors and those of the Milanese arranged for him to command
the forces of the new republic, with the same remuneration he had
received from the duke at the time of his decease. To this they added
the possession of Brescia, until Verona was recovered, when he should
have that city and restore Brescia to the Milanese.

Before the duke's death, Pope Nicholas, after his assumption of the
pontificate, sought to restore peace among the princes of Italy, and
with this object endeavored, in conjunction with the ambassadors sent by
the Florentines to congratulate him on his accession, to appoint a diet
at Ferrara to attempt either the arrangement of a long truce, or the
establishment of peace. A congress was accordingly held in that city,
of the pope's legate and the Venetian, ducal, and Florentine
representatives. King Alfonso had no envoy there. He was at Tivoli with
a great body of horse and foot, and favorable to the duke; both having
resolved, that having gained the count over to their side, they would
openly attack the Florentines and Venetians, and till the arrival of
the count in Lombardy, take part in the treaty for peace at Ferrara, at
which, though the king did not appear, he engaged to concur in whatever
course the duke should adopt. The conference lasted several days, and
after many debates, resolved on either a truce for five years, or a
permanent peace, whichsoever the duke should approve; and the ducal
ambassadors, having returned to Milan to learn his decision, found him
dead. Notwithstanding this, the Milanese were disposed to adopt the
resolutions of the assembly, but the Venetians refused, indulging
great hopes of becoming masters of Lombardy, particularly as Lodi and
Piacenza, immediately after the duke's death, had submitted to them.
They trusted that either by force or by treaty they could strip Milan
of her power; and then so press her, as to compel her also to surrender
before any assistance could arrive; and they were the more confident of
this from seeing the Florentines involved in war with King Alfonso.

The king being at Tivoli, and designing to pursue his enterprise against
Tuscany, as had been arranged between himself and Filippo, judging
that the war now commenced in Lombardy would give him both time and
opportunity, and wishing to have a footing in the Florentine state
before he openly commenced hostilities, opened a secret understanding
with the fortress of Cennina, in the Val d'Arno Superiore, and took
possession of it. The Florentines, surprised with this unexpected event,
perceiving the king already in action, and resolved to do them all
the injury in his power, hired forces, created a council of ten for
management of the war, and prepared for the conflict in their usual
manner. The king was already in the Siennese, and used his utmost
endeavors to reduce the city, but the inhabitants of Sienna were firm in
their attachment to the Florentines, and refused to receive him within
their walls or into any of their territories. They furnished him with
provisions, alleging in excuse, the enemy's power and their inability
to resist. The king, finding he could not enter by the Val d'Arno, as he
had first intended, both because Cennina had been already retaken, and
because the Florentines were now in some measure prepared for their
defense, turned toward Volterra, and occupied many fortresses in that
territory. Thence he proceeded toward Pisa, and with the assistance of
Fazio and Arrigo de' Conti, of the Gherardesca, took some castles, and
issuing from them, assailed Campiglia, but could not take it, the place
being defended by the Florentines, and it being now in the depth of
winter. Upon this the king, leaving garrisons in the places he had taken
to harass the surrounding country, withdrew with the remainder of his
army to quarters in the Siennese. The Florentines, aided by the season,
used the most active exertions to provide themselves troops, whose
captains were Federigo, lord of Urbino, and Gismondo Malatesti da
Rimino, who, though mutual foes, were kept so united by the prudence
of the commissaries, Neri di Gino and Bernardetto de' Medici, that they
broke up their quarters while the weather was still very severe and
recovered not only the places that had been taken in the territory of
Pisa, but also the Pomerancie in the neighborhood of Volterra, and so
checked the king's troops, which at first had overrun the Maremma, that
they could scarcely retain the places they had been left to garrison.

Upon the return of the spring the commissaries halted with their whole
force, consisting of five thousand horse and two thousand foot, at the
Spedaletto. The king approached with his army, amounting to fifteen
thousand men, within three miles of Campiglia, but when it was expected
he would attack the place he fell upon Piombino, hoping, as it was
insufficiently provided, to take it with very little trouble, and thus
acquire a very important position, the loss of which would be severely
felt by the Florentines; for from it he would be able to exhaust them
with a long war, obtain his own provision by sea, and harass the whole
territory of Pisa. They were greatly alarmed at this attack, and,
considering that if they could remain with their army among the woods
of Campiglia, the king would be compelled to retire either in defeat
or disgrace. With this view they equipped four galleys at Livorno, and
having succeeded in throwing three hundred infantry into Piombino,
took up their own position at the Caldane, a place where it would be
difficult to attack them; and they thought it would be dangerous to
encamp among the thickets of the plain.

The Florentine army depended for provisions on the surrounding places,
which, being poor and thinly inhabited, had difficulty in supplying
them. Consequently the troops suffered, particularly from want of wine,
for none being produced in that vicinity, and unable to procure it from
more distant places, it was impossible to obtain a sufficient quantity.
But the king, though closely pressed by the Florentines, was well
provided except in forage, for he obtained everything else by sea. The
Florentines, desirous to supply themselves in the same manner, loaded
four vessels with provisions, but, upon their approach, they were
attacked by seven of the king's galleys, which took two of them and
put the rest to flight. This disaster made them despair of procuring
provisions, so that two hundred men of a foraging party, principally for
want of wine, deserted to the king, and the rest complained that
they could not live without it, in a situation where the heat was so
excessive and the water bad. The commissaries therefore determined
to quit the place, and endeavor to recover those castles which still
remained in the enemy's power; who, on his part, though not suffering
from want of provisions, and greatly superior in numbers, found his
enterprise a failure, from the ravages made in his army by those
diseases which the hot season produces in marshy localities; and which
prevailed to such an extent that many died daily, and nearly all were
affected. These circumstances occasioned overtures of peace. The king
demanded fifty thousand florins, and the possession of Piombino. When
the terms were under consideration, many citizens, desirous of peace,
would have accepted them, declaring there was no hope of bringing to a
favorable conclusion a war which required so much money to carry it on.
But Neri Capponi going to Florence, placed the matter in a more correct
light, and it was then unanimously determined to reject the proposal,
and take the lord of Piombino under their protection, with an alliance
offensive and defensive, provided he did not abandon them, but assist in
their defense as hitherto. The king being informed of this resolution,
saw that, with his reduced army, he could not gain the place, and
withdrew in the same condition as if completely routed, leaving behind
him two thousand dead. With the remainder of his sick troops he retired
to the Siennese territory, and thence to his kingdom, incensed against
the Florentines, and threatening them with new wars upon the return of
spring.

While these events were proceeding in Tuscany the Count Sforza, having
become leader of the Milanese forces, strenuously endeavored to secure
the friendship of Francesco Piccinino, who was also in their service,
that he might support him in his enterprises, or be less disposed to do
him injury. He then took the field with his army, upon which the people
of Pavia, conscious of their inability to resist him, and unwilling to
obey the Milanese, offered to submit themselves to his authority, on
condition that he should not subject them to the power of Milan. The
count desired the possession of Pavia, and considered the circumstance
a happy omen, as it would enable him to give a color to his designs. He
was not restrained from treachery either by fear or shame; for great men
consider failure disgraceful,--a fraudulent success the contrary. But
he was apprehensive that his possession of the city would excite the
animosity of the Milanese, and perhaps induce them to throw themselves
under the power of the Venetians. If he refused to accept the offer,
he would have occasion to fear the duke of Savoy, to whom many citizens
were inclined to submit themselves; and either alternative would deprive
him of the sovereignty of Lombardy. Concluding there was less danger in
taking possession of the city than in allowing another to have it, he
determined to accept the proposal of the people of Pavia, trusting he
would be able to satisfy the Milanese, to whom he pointed out the danger
they must have incurred had he not complied with it; for her citizens
would have surrendered themselves to the Venetians or to the duke of
Savoy; so that in either case they would have been deprived of the
government, and therefore they ought to be more willing to have himself
as their neighbor and friend, than a hostile power such as either of the
others, and their enemy. The Milanese were upon this occasion greatly
perplexed, imagining they had discovered the count's ambition, and
the end he had in view; but they thought it desirable to conceal their
fears, for they did not know, if the count were to desert them, to whom
they could have recourse except the Venetians, whose pride and tyranny
they naturally dreaded. They therefore resolved not to break with the
count, but by his assistance remedy the evils with which they were
threatened, hoping that when freed from them they might rescue
themselves from him also; for at that time they were assailed not only
by the Venetians but by the Genoese and the duke of Savoy, in the name
of Charles of Orleans, the son of a sister of Filippo, but whom the
count easily vanquished. Thus their only remaining enemies were the
Venetians, who, with a powerful army, determined to occupy their
territories, and had already taken possession of Lodi and Piacenza,
before which latter place the count encamped; and, after a long siege,
took and pillaged the city. Winter being set in, he led his forces into
quarters, and then withdrew to Cremona, where, during the cold season,
he remained in repose with his wife.

In the spring, the Venetian and Milanese armies again took the field. It
was the design of the Milanese, first to recover Lodi and then to come
to terms with the Venetians; for the expenses of the war had become very
great, and they were doubtful of their general's sincerity, so that they
were anxious alike for the repose of peace, and for security against the
count. They therefore resolved that the army should march to the siege
of Carravaggio, hoping that Lodi would surrender, on that fortress being
wrested from the enemy's hands. The count obeyed, though he would have
preferred crossing the Adda and attacking the Brescian territory. Having
encamped before Caravaggio, he so strongly entrenched himself, that if
the enemy attempted to relieve the place, they would have to attack
him at a great disadvantage. The Venetian army, led by Micheletto,
approached within two bowshots of the enemy's camp, and many skirmishes
ensued. The count continued to press the fortress, and reduced it to the
very last extremity, which greatly distressed the Venetians, since they
knew the loss of it would involve the total failure of their expedition.
Very different views were entertained by their military officers
respecting the best mode of relieving the place, but they saw no
course open except to attack the enemy in his trenches, in spite of
all obstacles. The castle was, however, considered of such paramount
importance, that the Venetian senate, though naturally timid, and averse
to all hazardous undertakings, chose rather to risk everything than
allow it to fall into the hands of the enemy.

They therefore resolved to attack the count at all events, and early
the next morning commenced their assault upon a point which was least
defended. At the first charge, as commonly happens in a surprise,
Francesco's whole army was thrown into dismay. Order, however, was
soon so completely restored by the count, that the enemy, after various
efforts to gain the outworks, were repulsed and put to flight; and so
entirely routed, that of twelve thousand horse only one thousand escaped
the hands of the Milanese, who took possession of all the carriages
and military stores; nor had the Venetians ever before suffered such a
thorough rout and overthrow. Among the plunder and prisoners, crouching
down, as if to escape observation, was found a Venetian commissary, who,
in the course of the war and before the fight, had spoken contemptuously
of the count, calling him "bastard," and "base-born." Being made
prisoner, he remembered his faults, and fearing punishment, being taken
before the count, was agonized with terror; and, as is usual with
mean minds (in prosperity insolent, in adversity abject and cringing),
prostrated himself, weeping and begging pardon for the offenses he
had committed. The count, taking him by the arm, raised him up, and
encouraged him to hope for the best. He then said he wondered how a
man so prudent and respectable as himself, could so far err as to
speak disparagingly of those who did not merit it; and as regarded the
insinuations which he had made against him, he really did not know how
Sforza his father, and Madonna Lucia his mother, had proceeded together,
not having been there, and having no opportunity of interfering in the
matter, so that he was not liable either to blame or praise. However,
he knew very well, that in regard to his own actions he had conducted
himself so that no one could blame him; and in proof of this he would
refer both the Venetian senate and himself to what had happened that
day. He then advised him in future to be more respectful in speaking of
others, and more cautious in regard to his own proceedings.



CHAPTER IV

The count's successes--The Venetians come to terms with him--Views of
the Venetians--Indignation of the Milanese against the count--Their
ambassador's address to him--The count's moderation and reply--The count
and the Milanese prepare for war--Milanese ambassadors at Venice--League
of the Venetians and Milanese--The count dupes the Venetians and
Milanese--He applies for assistance to the Florentines--Diversity of
opinions in Florence on the subject--Neri di Gino Capponi averse to
assisting the count--Cosmo de' Medici disposed to do so--The Florentines
sent ambassadors to the count.

After this victory, the count marched into the Brescian territory,
occupied the whole country, and then pitched his camp within two miles
of the city. The Venetians, having well-grounded fears that Brescia
would be next attacked, provided the best defense in their power. They
then collected the relics of their army, and, by virtue of the treaty,
demanded assistance of the Florentines; who, being relieved from the
war with Alfonso, sent them one thousand foot and two thousand horse, by
whose aid the Venetians were in a condition to treat for peace. At one
time it seemed the fate of their republic to lose by war and win by
negotiation; for what was taken from them in battle was frequently
restored twofold on the restoration of peace. They knew the Milanese
were jealous of the count, and that he wished to be not their captain
merely, but their sovereign; and as it was in their power to make peace
with either of the two (the one desiring it from ambition, the other
from fear), they determined to make choice of the count, and offer him
assistance to effect his design; persuading themselves, that as the
Milanese would perceive they had been duped by him, they would in
revenge place themselves in the power of any one rather than in his; and
that, becoming unable either to defend themselves or trust the count,
they would be compelled, having no other resource, to fall into their
hands. Having taken this resolution, they sounded the count, and found
him quite disposed for peace, evidently desirous that the honor and
advantage of the victory at Caravaggio should be his own, and not accrue
to the Milanese. The parties therefore entered into an agreement, in
which the Venetians undertook to pay the count thirteen thousand florins
per month, till he should obtain Milan, and to furnish him, during the
continuance of the war, four thousand horse and two thousand foot. The
count engaged to restore to the Venetians the towns, prisoners, and
whatever else had been taken by him during the late campaigns, and
content himself with those territories which the duke possessed at the
time of his death.

When this treaty became known at Milan, it grieved the citizens more
than the victory at Caravaggio had exhilarated them. The rulers of the
city mourned, the people complained, women and children wept, and all
exclaimed against the count as false and perfidious. Although they
could not hope that either prayers or promises would divert him from his
ungrateful design, they sent ambassadors to see with what kind of color
he would invest his unprincipled proceedings, and being admitted to his
presence, one of them spoke to the following effect;--"It is customary
with those who wish to obtain a favor, to make use either of prayers,
presents, or threats, that pity, convenience, or fear, may induce a
compliance with their requests. But as with cruel, avaricious, or, in
their own conceit, powerful men, these arguments have no weight, it is
vain to hope, either to soften them by prayers, win them by presents, or
alarm them by menaces. We, therefore, being now, though late, aware of
thy pride, cruelty, and ambition, come hither, not to ask aught, nor
with the hope, even if we were so disposed, of obtaining it, but to
remind thee of the benefits thou hast received from the people of Milan,
and to prove with what heartless ingratitude thou hast repaid them,
that at least, under the many evils oppressing us, we may derive some
gratification from telling thee how and by whom they have been produced.
Thou canst not have forgotten thy wretched condition at the death of the
duke Filippo; the king and the pope were both thine enemies; thou hadst
abandoned the Florentines and the Venetians, who, on account of their
just indignation, and because they stood in no further need of thee,
were almost become thy declared enemies. Thou wert exhausted by thy
wars against the church; with few followers, no friends, or any money;
hopeless of being able to preserve either thy territories or thy
reputation. From these circumstances thy ruin must have ensued, but for
our simplicity; we received thee to our home, actuated by reverence for
the happy memory of our duke, with whom, being connected by marriage and
renewed alliance, we believed thy affection would descend to those
who had inherited his authority, and that, if to the benefits he had
conferred on thee, our own were added, the friendship we sought to
establish would not only be firm, but inseparable; with this impression,
we added Verona or Brescia to thy previous appointments. What more could
we either give or promise thee? What else couldst thou, not from
us merely, but from any others, have either had or expected? Thou
receivedst from us an unhoped-for benefit, and we, in return, an
unmerited wrong. Neither hast thou deferred until now the manifestation
of thy base designs; for no sooner wert thou appointed to command our
armies, than, contrary to every dictate of propriety, thou didst accept
Pavia, which plainly showed what was to be the result of thy friendship;
but we bore with the injury, in hope that the greatness of the advantage
would satisfy thy ambition. Alas! those who grasp at all cannot be
satisfied with a part. Thou didst promise that we should possess the
conquests which thou might afterward make; for thou wert well aware that
what was given at many times might be withdrawn at once, as was the case
after the victory at Caravaggio, purchased by our money and blood, and
followed by our ruin. Oh! unhappy states, which have to guard against
their oppressor; but much more wretched those who have to trust to
mercenary and faithless arms like thine! May our example instruct
posterity, since that of Thebes and Philip of Macedon, who, after
victory over her enemies, from being her captain became her foe and her
prince, could not avail us.

"The only fault of which we are conscious is our over-weening confidence
in one whom we ought not to have trusted; for thy past life, thy
restless mind, incapable of repose, ought to have put us on our guard;
neither ought we to have confided in one who betrayed the lord of Lucca,
set a fine upon the Florentines and the Venetians, defied the duke,
despised the king, and besides all this, persecuted the church of God,
and the Divinity himself with innumerable atrocities. We ought not to
have fancied that so many potentates possessed less influence over the
mind of Francesco Sforza, than the Milanese; or that he would preserve
unblemished that faith towards us which he had on so many occasions
broken with them. Still this want of caution in us does not excuse the
perfidy in thee; nor can it obliterate the infamy with which our just
complaints will blacken thy character throughout the world, or prevent
the remorse of thy conscience, when our arms are used for our own
destruction; for thou wilt see that the sufferings due to parricides are
fully deserved by thee. And though ambition should blind thine eyes, the
whole world, witness to thine iniquity, will compel thee to open them;
God himself will unclose them, if perjuries, if violated faith, if
treacheries displease him, and if, as ever, he is still the enemy of the
wicked. Do not, therefore, promise thyself any certainty of victory; for
the just wrath of the Almighty will weigh heavily upon thee; and we are
resolved to lose our liberty only with our lives; but if we found we
could not ultimately defend it, we would submit ourselves to anyone
rather than to thee. And if our sins be so great that in spite of
our utmost resolution, we should still fall into thy hands, be quite
assured, that the sovereignty which is commenced in deceit and villainy,
will terminate either in thyself or thy children with ignominy and
blood."

The count, though not insensible to the just reproaches of the Milanese,
did not exhibit either by words or gestures any unusual excitement, and
replied, that "He willingly attributed to their angry feelings all the
serious charges of their indiscreet harangue; and he would reply to
them in detail, were he in the presence of anyone who could decide
their differences; for it would be evident that he had not injured the
Milanese, but only taken care that they should not injure him. They
well knew how they had proceeded after the victory of Caravaggio; for,
instead of rewarding him with either Verona or Brescia, they sought
peace with the Venetians, that all the blame of the quarrel might rest
on him, themselves obtaining the fruit of victory, the credit of peace,
and all the advantages that could be derived from the war. It would
thus be manifest they had no right to complain, when he had effected
the arrangements which they first attempted to make; and that if he had
deferred to do so a little longer, he would have had reason to accuse
them of the ingratitude with which they were now charging him. Whether
the charge were true or false, that God, whom they had invoked to avenge
their injuries, would show at the conclusion of the war, and would
demonstrate which was most his friend, and who had most justice on their
side."

Upon the departure of the ambassadors, the count determined to attack
the Milanese, who prepared for their defense, and appointed Francesco
and Jacopo Piccinino (attached to their cause, on account of the ancient
feud of the families of Braccio and Sforza) to conduct their forces in
support of liberty; at least till they could deprive the count of
the aid of the Venetians, who they did not think would long be either
friendly or faithful to him. On the other hand, the count, perfectly
aware of this, thought it not imprudent, supposing the obligation of
the treaty insufficient, to bind them by the ties of interest; and,
therefore, in assigning to each their portion of the enterprise, he
consented that the Venetians should attack Crema, and himself, with the
other forces, assail the remainder of the territory. The advantage of
this arrangement kept the Venetians so long in alliance with the count,
that he was enabled to conquer the whole of the Milanese territory, and
to press the city so closely, that the inhabitants could not provide
themselves with necessaries; despairing of success, they sent envoys to
the Venetians to beg they would compassionate their distress, and, as
ought to be the case between republics, assist them in defense of their
liberty against a tyrant, whom, if once master of their city, they would
be unable to restrain; neither did they think he would be content with
the boundaries assigned him by the treaty, but would expect all the
dependencies of Milan.

The Venetians had not yet taken Crema, and wishing before they changed
sides, to effect this point, they PUBLICLY answered the envoys, that
their engagements with the count prevented them from defending the
Milanese; but SECRETLY, gave them every assurance of their wish to do
so.

The count had approached so near Milan with his forces, that he was
disputing the suburbs with the inhabitants, when the Venetians having
taken Crema, thought they need no longer hesitate to declare in favor of
the Milanese, with whom they made peace and entered into alliance; among
the terms of which was the defense of their liberty unimpaired. Having
come to this agreement, they ordered their forces to withdraw from the
count's camp and to return to the Venetian territory. They informed
him of the peace made with the Milanese, and gave him twenty days to
consider what course he would adopt. He was not surprised at the step
taken by the Venetians, for he had long foreseen it, and expected its
occurrence daily; but when it actually took place, he could not
avoid feeling regret and displeasure similar to what the Milanese had
experienced when he abandoned them. He took two days to consider the
reply he would make to the ambassadors whom the Venetians had sent to
inform him of the treaty, and during this time he determined to dupe the
Venetians, and not abandon his enterprise; therefore, appearing openly
to accept the proposal for peace, he sent his ambassadors to Venice with
full credentials to effect the ratification, but gave them secret orders
not to do so, and with pretexts or caviling to put it off. To give the
Venetians greater assurance of his sincerity, he made a truce with the
Milanese for a month, withdrew from Milan and divided his forces among
the places he had taken. This course was the occasion of his victory and
the ruin of the Milanese; for the Venetians, confident of peace, were
slow in preparing for war, and the Milanese finding the truce concluded,
the enemy withdrawn, and the Venetians their friends, felt assured that
the count had determined to abandon his design. This idea injured them
in two ways: one, by neglecting to provide for their defense; the next,
that, being seed-time, they sowed a large quantity of grain in the
country which the enemy had evacuated, and thus brought famine upon
themselves. On the other hand, all that was injurious to his enemies
favored the count, and the time gave him opportunity to take breath and
provide himself with assistance.

The Florentines during the war of Lombardy had not declared in favor of
either party, or assisted the count either in defense of the Milanese or
since; for he never having been in need had not pressingly requested
it; and they only sent assistance to the Venetians after the rout at
Caravaggio, in pursuance of the treaty. Count Francesco, standing now
alone, and not knowing to whom else he could apply, was compelled to
request immediate aid of the Florentines, publicly from the state, and
privately from friends, particularly from Cosmo de' Medici, with whom he
had always maintained a steady friendship, and by whom he had constantly
been faithfully advised and liberally supported. Nor did Cosmo abandon
him in his extreme necessity, but supplied him generously from his own
resources, and encouraged him to prosecute his design. He also wished
the city publicly to assist him, but there were difficulties in the way.
Neri di Gino Capponi, one of the most powerful citizens of Florence,
thought it not to the advantage of the city, that the count should
obtain Milan; and was of opinion that it would be more to the safety
of Italy for him to ratify the peace than pursue the war. In the first
place, he apprehended that the Milanese, through their anger against the
count, would surrender themselves entirely to the Venetians, which would
occasion the ruin of all. Supposing he should occupy Milan, it appeared
to him that so great military superiority, combined with such an extent
of territory, would be dangerous to themselves, and that if as count
he was intolerable, he would become doubly so as duke. He therefore
considered it better for the republic of Florence and for Italy, that
the count should be content with his military reputation, and that
Lombardy should be divided into two republics, which could never be
united to injure others, and separately are unable to do so. To attain
this he saw no better means than to refrain from aiding the count, and
continuing in the former league with the Venetians. These reasonings
were not satisfactory to Cosmo's friends, for they imagined that Neri
had argued thus, not from a conviction of its advantage to the republic,
but to prevent the count, as a friend of Cosmo, from becoming duke,
apprehending that Cosmo would, in consequence of this, become too
powerful.

Cosmo, in reply, pointed out, that to lend assistance to the count would
be highly beneficial both to Italy and the republic; for it was unwise
to imagine the Milanese could preserve their own liberty; for the nature
of their community, their mode of life, and their hereditary feuds were
opposed to every kind of civil government, so that it was necessary,
either that the count should become duke of Milan, or the Venetians her
lords. And surely under such circumstances, no one could doubt which
would be most to their advantage, to have for their neighbor a powerful
friend or a far more powerful foe. Neither need it be apprehended
that the Milanese, while at war with the count, would submit to the
Venetians; for the count had a stronger party in the city, and
the Venetians had not, so that whenever they were unable to defend
themselves as freemen, they would be more inclined to obey the count
than the Venetians.

These diverse views kept the city long in suspense; but at length it
was resolved to send ambassadors to the count to settle the terms of
agreement, with instructions, that if they found him in such a condition
as to give hopes of his ultimate success, they were to close with him,
but, if otherwise, they were to draw out the time in diplomacy.



CHAPTER V

Prosecution of the war between the count and the Milanese--The Milanese
reduced to extremity--The people rise against the magistrates--Milan
surrenders to the count--League between the new duke of Milan and the
Florentines, and between the king of Naples and the Venetians--Venetian
and Neapolitan ambassadors at Florence--Answer of Cosmo de' Medici to
the Venetian ambassador--Preparations of the Venetians and the king
of Naples for the war--The Venetians excite disturbances in
Bologna--Florence prepares for war--The emperor, Frederick III.
at Florence--War in Lombardy between the duke of Milan and the
Venetians--Ferrando, son of the king of Naples, marches into Tuscany
against the Florentines.

The ambassadors were at Reggio when they heard that the count had become
lord of Milan; for as soon as the truce had expired, he approached the
city with his forces, hoping quickly to get possession of it in spite
of the Venetians, who could bring no relief except from the side of
the Adda, which route he could easily obstruct, and therefore had no
apprehension (being then winter) of their arrival, and he trusted that,
before the return of spring, he would be victorious, particularly, as
by the death of Francesco Piccinino, there remained only Jacopo his
brother, to command the Milanese. The Venetians had sent an ambassador
to Milan to confirm the citizens in their resolution of defense,
promising them powerful and immediate aid. During the winter a few
slight skirmishes had taken place between the count and the Venetians;
but on the approach of milder weather, the latter, under Pandolfo
Malatesti, halted with their army upon the Adda, and considering
whether, in order to succor the Milanese, they ought to risk a battle,
Pardolfo, their general, aware of the count's abilities, and the courage
of his army, said it would be unadvisable to do so, and that, under the
circumstances, it was needless, for the count, being in great want of
forage, could not keep the field, and must soon retire. He therefore
advised them to remain encamped, to keep the Milanese in hope, and
prevent them from surrendering. This advice was approved by the
Venetians, both as being safe, and because, by keeping the Milanese in
this necessity, they might be the sooner compelled to submit to their
dominion; for they felt quite sure that the injuries they had received
would always prevent their submission to the count.

In the meantime, the Milanese were reduced to the utmost misery; and as
the city usually abounded with poor, many died of hunger in the streets;
hence arose complaints and disturbances in several parts, which alarmed
the magistrates, and compelled them to use their utmost exertions to
prevent popular meetings. The multitude are always slow to resolve on
commotion; but the resolution once formed, any trivial circumstance
excites it to action. Two men in humble life, talking together near the
Porta Nuova of the calamities of the city, their own misery, and the
means that might be adopted for their relief, others beginning to
congregate, there was soon collected a large crowd; in consequence of
it a report was spread that the neighborhood of Porta Nuova had risen
against the government. Upon this, all the lower orders, who only waited
for an example, assembled in arms, and chose Gasparre da Vicomercato to
be their leader. They then proceeded to the place where the magistrates
were assembled, and attacked them so impetuously that all who did not
escape by flight were slain: among the number, as being considered a
principal cause of the famine, and gratified at their distress, fell
Lionardo Veniero, the Venetian ambassador. Having thus almost become
masters of the city, they considered what course was next to be adopted
to escape from the horrors surrounding them, and to procure peace. A
feeling universally prevailed, that as they could not preserve their own
liberty, they ought to submit to a prince who could defend them. Some
proposed King Alfonso, some the duke of Savoy, and others the king
of France, but none mentioned the count, so great was the general
indignation against him. However, disagreeing with the rest, Gasparre da
Vicomercato proposed him, and explained in detail that if they desired
relief from war, no other plan was open, since the people of Milan
required a certain and immediate peace, and not a distant hope
of succor. He apologized for the count's proceedings, accused the
Venetians, and all the powers of Italy, of which some from ambition and
others from avarice were averse to their possessing freedom. Having to
dispose of their liberty, it would be preferable, he said, to obey one
who knew and could defend them; so that, by their servitude they might
obtain peace, and not bring upon themselves greater evils and more
dangerous wars. He was listened to with the most profound attention;
and, having concluded his harangue, it was unanimously resolved by the
assembly, that the count should be called in, and Gasparre was appointed
to wait upon him and signify their desire. By the people's command he
conveyed the pleasing and happy intelligence to the count, who heard
it with the utmost satisfaction, and entered Milan as prince on the
twenty-sixth of February, 1450, where he was received with the greatest
possible joy by those who, only a short time previously had heaped on
him all the slanders that hatred could inspire.

The news of this event reaching Florence, orders were immediately sent
to the envoys who were upon the way to Milan, that instead of treating
for his alliance with the count, they should congratulate the duke
upon his victory; they, arranging accordingly, had a most honorable
reception, and were treated with all possible respect; for the duke
well knew that in all Italy he could not find braver or more faithful
friends, to defend him against the power of the Venetians, than the
Florentines, who, being no longer in fear of the house of Visconti,
found themselves opposed by the Aragonese and Venetians; for the
Aragonese princes of Naples were jealous of the friendship which
the Florentines had always evinced for the family of France; and the
Venetians seeing the ancient enmity of the Florentines against the
Visconti transferred to themselves, resolved to injure them as much
as possible; for they knew how pertinaciously and invariably they had
persecuted the Lombard princes. These considerations caused the new duke
willingly to join the Florentines, and united the Venetians and King
Alfonso against their common enemies; impelling them at the same time to
hostilities, the king against the Florentines, and the Venetians against
the duke, who, being fresh in the government, would, they imagined, be
unable to resist them, even with all the aid he could obtain.

But as the league between the Florentines and the Venetians still
continued, and as the king, after the war of Piombino, had made peace
with the former, it seemed indecent to commence an open rupture until
some plausible reason could be assigned in justification of offensive
measures. On this account each sent ambassadors to Florence, who, on the
part of their sovereigns, signified that the league formed between them
was made not for injury to any, but solely for the mutual defense
of their states. The Venetian ambassador then complained that the
Florentines had allowed Alessandro, the duke's brother, to pass into
Lombardy with his forces; and besides this, had assisted and advised
in the treaty made between the duke and the marquis of Mantua, matters
which he declared to be injurious to the Venetians, and inconsistent
with the friendship hitherto subsisting between the two governments;
amicably reminding them, that one who inflicts unmerited injury, gives
others just ground of hostility, and that those who break a peace may
expect war. The Signory appointed Cosmo de' Medici to reply to what had
been said by the Venetian ambassador, and in a long and excellent
speech he recounted the numerous advantages conferred by the city on the
Venetian republic; showed what an extent of dominion they had acquired
by the money, forces, and counsel of the Florentines, and reminded him
that, although the friendship had originated with the Florentines, they
had never given occasion of enmity; and as they desired peace, they
greatly rejoiced when the treaty was made, if it had been entered into
for the sake of peace, and not of war. True it was, he wondered much
at the remarks which had been made, seeing that such light and trivial
matters should give offense to so great a republic; but if they were
worthy of notice he must have it universally understood, that the
Florentines wished their country to be free and open to all; and that
the duke's character was such, that if he desired the friendship of
the marquis of Mantua, he had no need of anyone's favor or advice. He
therefore feared that these cavils were produced by some latent motive,
which it was not thought proper to disclose. Be this as it might,
they would freely declare to all, that in the same proportion as the
friendship of the Florentines was beneficial their enmity could be
destructive.

The matter was hushed up; and the ambassadors, on their departure,
appeared perfectly satisfied. But the league between the king and the
Venetians made the Florentines and the duke rather apprehend war than
hope for a long continuance of peace. They therefore entered into an
alliance, and at the same time the enmity of the Venetians transpired by
a treaty with the Siennese, and the expulsion of all Florentine subjects
from their cities and territories. Shortly after this, Alfonso did the
same, without any consideration of the peace made the year previous, and
not having even the shadow of an excuse. The Venetians attempted to
take Bologna, and having armed the emigrants, and united to them a
considerable force, introduced them into the city by night through one
of the common sewers. No sooner had they entered, than they raised a
cry, by which Santi Bentivogli, being awakened, was told that the whole
city was in possession of the rebels. But though many advised him
to escape, saying that he could not save the city by his stay, he
determined to confront the danger, and taking arms encouraged his
followers, assembled a few friends, attacked and routed part of the
rebels, slew many more, and drove the remainder out of the city. By this
act of bravery all agreed he had fully proved himself a genuine scion of
the house of the Bentivogli.

These events and demonstrations gave the Florentines an earnest of
approaching war; they consequently followed their usual practice on
similar occasions, and created the Council of Ten. They engaged new
condottieri, sent ambassadors to Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, and
Sienna, to demand assistance from their friends, gain information about
those they suspected, decide such as were wavering, and discover the
designs of the foe. From the pope they obtained only general expressions
of an amicable disposition and admonitions to peace; from the king,
empty excuses for having expelled the Florentines, and offers of safe
conduct for whoever should demand it; and although he endeavored, as
much as possible, to conceal every indication of his hostile designs,
the ambassadors felt convinced of his unfriendly disposition, and
observed many preparations tending to the injury of the republic. The
League with the duke was strengthened by mutual obligations, and through
his means they became friends with the Genoese, the old differences with
them respecting reprisals, and other small matters of dispute, being
composed, although the Venetians used every possible means to prevent
it, and entreated the emperor of Constantinople to expel all Florentines
from his dominions; so fierce was the animosity with which they entered
on this war, and so powerful their lust of dominion, that without the
least hesitation they sought the destruction of those who had been the
occasion of their own power. The emperor, however, refused to listen to
them. The Venetian senate forbade the Florentine ambassadors to enter
their territories, alleging, that being in league with the king, they
could not entertain them without his concurrence. The Siennese received
the ambassadors with fair words, fearing their own ruin before the
League could assist them, and therefore endeavored to appease the powers
whose attack they were unable to resist. The Venetians and the king (as
was then conjectured) were disposed to send ambassadors to Florence to
justify the war. But the Venetian envoy was not allowed to enter the
Florentine dominions, and the king's ambassador, being unwilling to
perform his office alone, the embassy was not completed; and thus
the Venetians learned, that however little they might esteem the
Florentines, the latter had still less respect for them.

In the midst of these fears, the emperor, Frederick III., came into
Italy to be crowned. On the thirtieth of January, 1451, he entered
Florence with fifteen hundred horse, and was most honorably received
by the Signory. He remained in the city till the sixth of February, and
then proceeded to Rome for his coronation, where, having been solemnly
consecrated, and his marriage celebrated with the empress, who had
come to Rome by sea, he returned to Germany, and again passed through
Florence in May, with the same honors as upon his arrival. On his
return, having derived some benefits from the marquis of Mantua, he
conceded to him Modena and Reggio. In the meantime, the Florentines did
not fail to prepare themselves for immediate war; and to augment their
influence, and strike the enemy with terror, they, in conjunction with
the duke, entered into alliance with the king of France for the mutual
defense of their states. This treaty was published with great pomp
throughout all Italy.

The month of May, 1452, having arrived, the Venetians thought it not
desirable to defer any longer their attack upon the duke, and with
sixteen thousand horse and six thousand foot assailed his territories
in the direction of Lodi, while the marquis of Montferrat, instigated
either by his own ambition or the entreaties of the Venetians, did the
same on the side of Alexandria. The duke assembled a force of eighteen
thousand cavalry and three thousand infantry, garrisoned Alexandria and
Lodi, and all the other places where the enemy might annoy them. He then
attacked the Brescian territory, and greatly harassed the Venetians;
while both parties alike plundered the country and ravaged the smaller
towns. Having defeated the marquis of Montferrat at Alexandria, the duke
was able to unite his whole force against the Venetians and invade their
territory.

While the war in Lombardy proceeded thus, giving rise to various
trifling incidents unworthy of recital, King Alfonso and the Florentines
carried on hostilities in Tuscany, but in a similarly inefficient
manner, evincing no greater talent, and incurring no greater danger.
Ferrando, the illegitimate son of Alfonso, entered the country with
twelve thousand troops, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino.
Their first attempt was to attack Fojano, in the Val di Chiane;
for, having the Siennese in their favor, they entered the Florentine
territory in that direction. The walls of the castle were weak, and it
was small, and consequently poorly manned, but the garrison were, among
the soldiers of that period, considered brave and faithful. Two hundred
infantry were also sent by the Signory for its defense. Before this
castle, thus provided, Ferrando sat down, and either from the valor of
its defenders or his own deficiencies, thirty-six days elapsed before
he took it. This interval enabled the city to make better provision
for places of greater importance, to collect forces and conclude more
effective arrangements than had hitherto been made. The enemy next
proceeded into the district of Chiane, where they attacked two small
towns, the property of private citizens, but could not capture them.
They then encamped before the Castellina, a fortress upon the borders
of the Chianti, within ten miles of Sienna, weak from its defective
construction, and still more so by its situation; but, notwithstanding
these defects, the assailants were compelled to retire in disgrace,
after having lain before it forty-four days. So formidable were those
armies, and so perilous those wars, that places now abandoned as
untenable were then defended as impregnable.

While Ferrando was encamped in the Chianti he made many incursions, and
took considerable booty from the Florentine territories, extending his
depredations within six miles of the city, to the great alarm and injury
of the people, who at this time, having sent their forces to the
number of eight thousand soldiers under Astorre da Faenza and Gismondo
Malatesti toward Castel di Colle, kept them at a distance from the
enemy, lest they should be compelled to an engagement; for they
considered that so long as they were not beaten in a pitched battle,
they could not be vanquished in the war generally; for small castles,
when lost, were recovered at the peace, and larger places were in no
danger, because the enemy would not venture to attack them. The king
had also a fleet of about twenty vessels, comprising galleys and smaller
craft, which lay off Pisa, and during the siege of Castellina were
moored near the Rocca di Vada, which, from the negligence of the
governor, he took, and then harassed the surrounding country. However,
this annoyance was easily removed by a few soldiers sent by the
Florentines to Campiglia, and who confined the enemy to the coast.



CHAPTER VI

Conspiracy of Stefano Porcari against the papal government--The
conspirators discovered and punished--The Florentines recover the places
they had lost--Gherardo Gambacorti, lord of Val di Bagno, endeavors
to transfer his territories to the king of Naples--Gallant conduct of
Antonio Gualandi, who counteracts the design of Gambacorti--René
of Anjou is called into Italy by the Florentines--René returns to
France--The pope endeavors to restore peace--Peace proclaimed--Jacopo
Piccinino attacks the Siennese.

The pontiff did not interfere in these affairs further than to endeavor
to bring the parties to a mutual accommodation; but while he refrained
from external wars he incurred the danger of more serious troubles at
home. Stefano Porcari was a Roman citizen, equally distinguished
for nobility of birth and extent of learning, but still more by the
excellence of his character. Like all who are in pursuit of glory, he
resolved either to perform or to attempt something worthy of memory, and
thought he could not do better than deliver his country from the hands
of the prelates, and restore the ancient form of government; hoping, in
the event of success, to be considered a new founder or second father of
the city. The dissolute manners of the priesthood, and the discontent
of the Roman barons and people, encouraged him to look for a happy
termination of his enterprise; but he derived his greatest confidence
from those verses of Petrarch in the canzone which begins, "Spirto
gentil che quelle membra reggi," where he says,--

"Sopra il Monte Tarpejo canzon vedra, Un cavalier, ch' Italia tutta
onora, Pensoso piu d'altrui, che di se stesso."

Stefano, believing poets are sometimes endowed with a divine and
prophetic spirit, thought the event must take place which Petrarch in
this canzone seemed to foretell, and that he was destined to effect the
glorious task; considering himself in learning, eloquence, friends, and
influence, superior to any other citizen of Rome. Having taken these
impressions, he had not sufficient prudence to avoid discovering his
design by his discourse, demeanor, and mode of living; so that the pope
becoming acquainted with it, in order to prevent the commission of some
rash act, banished him to Bologna and charged the governor of the city
to compel his appearance before him once every day. Stefano was
not daunted by this first check, but with even greater earnestness
prosecuted his undertaking, and, by such means as were available, more
cautiously corresponded with his friends, and often went and returned
from Rome with such celerity as to be in time to present himself
before the governor within the limit allowed for his appearance. Having
acquired a sufficient number of partisans, he determined to make the
attempt without further delay, and arranged with his friends at Rome to
provide an evening banquet, to which all the conspirators were invited,
with orders that each should bring with him his most trust-worthy
friends, and himself promised to be with him before the entertainment
was served. Everything was done according to this orders, and Stefano
Porcari arrived at the place appointed. Supper being brought in, he
entered the apartment dressed in cloth of gold, with rich ornaments
about his neck, to give him a dignified appearance and commanding
aspect. Having embraced the company, he delivered a long oration to
dispose their minds to the glorious undertaking. He then arranged the
measures to be adopted, ordering that one part of them should, on the
following morning, take possession of the pontiff's palace, and that
the other should call the people of Rome to arms. The affair came to the
knowledge of the pope the same night, some say by treachery among the
conspirators, and others that he knew of Porcari's presence at Rome. Be
this as it may, on the night of the supper Stefano, and the greater part
of his associates, were arrested, and afterward expiated their crime
by death. Thus ended his enterprise; and though some may applaud his
intentions, he must stand charged with deficiency of understanding; for
such undertakings, though possessing some slight appearance of glory,
are almost always attended with ruin.

Gherardo Gambacorti was lord of Val di Bagno, and his ancestors as well
as himself had always been in the pay or under the protection of the
Florentines. Alfonso endeavored to induce him to exchange his territory
for another in the kingdom of Naples. This became known to the
Signory, who, in order to ascertain his designs, sent an ambassador
to Gambacorti, to remind him of the obligations of his ancestors and
himself to their republic, and induce him to continue faithful to them.
Gherardo affected the greatest astonishment, assured the ambassador with
solemn oaths that no such treacherous thought had ever entered his mind,
and that he would gladly go to Florence and pledge himself for the truth
of his assertions; but being unable, from indisposition, he would send
his son as an hostage. These assurances, and the proposal with which
they were accompanied, induced the Florentines to think Gherardo had
been slandered, and that his accuser must be alike weak and treacherous.
Gherardo, however, hastened his negotiation with redoubled zeal, and
having arranged the terms, Alfonso sent Frate Puccio, a knight of
Jerusalem, with a strong body of men to the Val di Bagno, to take
possession of the fortresses and towns, the people of which, being
attached to the Florentine republic, submitted unwillingly.

Frate Puccio had already taken possession of nearly the whole territory,
except the fortress of Corzano. Gambacorti was accompanied, while
transferring his dominions, by a young Pisan of great courage and
address, named Antonio Gualandi, who, considering the whole affair, the
strength of the place, the well known bravery of the garrison, their
evident reluctance to give it up, and the baseness of Gambacorti,
at once resolved to make an effort to prevent the fulfillment of
his design; and Gherardo being at the entrance, for the purpose of
introducing the Aragonese, he pushed him out with both his hands, and
commanded the guards to shut the gate upon such a scoundrel, and hold
the fortress for the Florentine republic. When this circumstance became
known in Bagno and the neighboring places, the inhabitants took up arms
against the king's forces, and, raising the Florentine standard, drove
them out. The Florentines learning these events, imprisoned Gherardo's
son, and sent troops to Bagno for the defense of the territory, which
having hitherto been governed by its own prince, now became a vicariate.
The traitor Gherardo escaped with difficulty, leaving his wife, family,
and all his property, in the hands of those whom he had endeavored
to betray. This affair was considered by the Florentines of great
importance; for had the king succeeded in securing the territory, he
might have overrun the Val di Tavere and the Casentino at his pleasure,
and would have caused so much annoyance, that they could no longer have
allowed their whole force to act against the army of the Aragonese at
Sienna.

In addition to the preparations made by the Florentines in Italy to
resist the hostile League, they sent as ambassador, Agnolo Acciajuoli,
to request that the king of France would allow René of Anjou to enter
Italy in favor of the duke and themselves, and also, that by his
presence in the country, he might defend his friends and attempt the
recovery of the kingdom of Naples; for which purpose they offered him
assistance in men and money. While the war was proceeding in Lombardy
and Tuscany, the ambassador effected an arrangement with King René,
who promised to come into Italy during the month of June, the League
engaging to pay him thirty thousand florins upon his arrival at
Alexandria, and ten thousand per month during the continuance of the
war. In pursuance of this treaty, King René commenced his march
into Italy, but was stopped by the duke of Savoy and the marquis of
Montferrat, who, being in alliance with the Venetians, would not allow
him to pass. The Florentine ambassador advised, that in order to uphold
the influence of his friends, he should return to Provence, and conduct
part of his forces into Italy by sea, and, in the meantime, endeavor,
by the authority of the king of France, to obtain a passage for the
remainder through the territories of the duke. This plan was completely
successful; for René came into Italy by sea, and his forces, by the
mediation of the king of France, were allowed a passage through Savoy.
King René was most honorably received by Duke Francesco, and joining his
French with the Italian forces, they attacked the Venetians with so much
impetuosity, that they shortly recovered all the places which had been
taken in the Cremonese. Not content with this, they occupied nearly
the whole Brescian territory; so that the Venetians, unable to keep the
field, withdrew close to the walls of Brescia.

Winter coming on, the duke deemed it advisable to retire into quarters,
and appointed Piacenza for the forces of René, where, having passed the
whole of the cold season of 1453, without attempting anything, the duke
thought of taking the field, on the approach of spring, and stripping
the Venetians of the remainder of their possessions by land, but was
informed by the king that he was obliged of necessity to return to
France. This determination was quite new and unexpected to the duke,
and caused him the utmost concern; but though he immediately went to
dissuade René from carrying it into effect, he was unable either by
promises or entreaties to divert him from his purpose. He engaged,
however, to leave part of his forces, and send his son for the service
of the League. The Florentines were not displeased at this; for having
recovered their territories and castles, they were no longer in fear of
Alfonso, and on the other hand, they did not wish the duke to obtain any
part of Lombardy but what belonged to him. René took his departure,
and send his son John into Italy, according to his promise, who did not
remain in Lombardy, but came direct to Florence, where he was received
with the highest respect.

The king's departure made the duke desirous of peace. The Venetians,
Alfonso, and the Florentines, being all weary of the war, were similarly
disposed; and the pope continued to wish it as much as ever; for during
this year the Turkish emperor, Mohammed, had taken Constantinople and
subdued the whole of Greece. This conquest alarmed the Christians, more
especially the Venetians and the pope, who already began to fancy
the Mohammedans at their doors. The pope therefore begged the Italian
potentates to send ambassadors to himself, with authority to negotiate
a general peace, with which all complied; but when the particular
circumstances of each case came to be considered, many difficulties were
found in the war of effecting it. King Alfonso required the Florentines
to reimburse the expenses he had incurred in the war, and the
Florentines demanded some compensation from him. The Venetians thought
themselves entitled to Cremona from the duke; while he insisted upon the
restoration of Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema; so that it seemed impossible
to reconcile such conflicting claims. But what could not be effected
by a number at Rome was easily managed at Milan and Venice by two;
for while the matter was under discussion at Rome, the duke and the
Venetians came to an arrangement on the ninth of April, 1454, by virtue
of which, each party resumed what they possessed before the war, the
duke being allowed to recover from the princes of Montferrat and Savoy
the places they had taken. To the other Italian powers a month was
allowed to ratify the treaty. The pope and the Florentines, and with
them the Siennese and other minor powers, acceded to it within the time.
Besides this, the Florentines, the Venetians, and the duke concluded
a treaty of peace for twenty-five years. King Alfonso alone exhibited
dissatisfaction at what had taken place, thinking he had not been
sufficiently considered, that he stood, not on the footing of a
principal, but only ranked as an auxiliary, and therefore kept aloof,
and would not disclose his intentions. However, after receiving a legate
from the pope, and many solemn embassies from other powers, he allowed
himself to be persuaded, principally by means of the pontiff, and with
his son joined the League for thirty years. The duke and the king also
contracted a twofold relationship and double marriage, each giving a
daughter to a son of the other. Notwithstanding this, that Italy might
still retain the seeds of war, Alfonso would not consent to the peace,
unless the League would allow him, without injury to themselves, to make
war upon the Genoese, Gismondo Malatesti, and Astorre, prince of Faenza.
This being conceded, his son Ferrando, who was at Sienna, returned to
the kingdom, having by his coming into Tuscany acquired no dominion and
lost a great number of his men.

Upon the establishment of a general peace, the only apprehension
entertained was, that it would be disturbed by the animosity of Alfonso
against the Genoese; yet it happened otherwise. The king, indeed, did
not openly infringe the peace, but it was frequently broken by the
ambition of the mercenary troops. The Venetians, as usual on the
conclusion of a war, had discharged Jacopo Piccinino, who with some
other unemployed condottieri, marched into Romagna, thence into the
Siennese, and halting in the country, took possession of many places.
At the commencement of these disturbances, and the beginning of the year
1455, Pope Nicholas died, and was succeeded by Calixtus III., who, to
put a stop to the war newly broken out so near home, immediately sent
Giovanni Ventimiglia, his general, with what forces he could furnish.
These being joined by the troops of the Florentines and the duke of
Milan, both of whom furnished assistance, attacked Jacopo, near Bolsena,
and though Ventimiglia was taken prisoner, yet Jacopo was worsted, and
retreated in disorder to Castiglione della Pescaia, where, had he
not been assisted by Alfonso, his force would have been completely
annihilated. This made it evident that Jacopo's movement had been
made by order of Alfonso, and the latter, as if palpably detected, to
conciliate his allies, after having almost alienated them with this
unimportant war, ordered Jacopo to restore to the Siennese the places he
had taken, and they gave him twenty thousand florins by way of ransom,
after which he and his forces were received into the kingdom of Naples.



CHAPTER VII

Christendom alarmed by the progress of the Turks--The Turks routed
before Belgrade--Description of a remarkable hurricane--War against
the Genoese and Gismondo Malatesti--Genoa submits to the king
of France--Death of Alfonso king of Naples--Succeeded by his son
Ferrando--The pope designs to give the kingdom of Naples to his nephew
Piero Lodovico Borgia--Eulogy of Pius II.--Disturbances in Genoa between
John of Anjou and the Fregosi--The Fregosi subdued--John attacks
the kingdom of Naples--Ferrando king of Naples routed--Ferrando
reinstated--The Genoese cast off the French yoke--John of Anjou routed
in the kingdom of Naples.

The pope, though anxious to restrain Jacopo Piccinino, did not neglect
to make provision for the defense of Christendom, which seemed in danger
from the Turks. He sent ambassadors and preachers into every Christian
country, to exhort princes and people to arm in defense of their
religion, and with their persons and property to contribute to the
enterprise against the common enemy. In Florence, large sums were
raised, and many citizens bore the mark of a red cross upon their dress
to intimate their readiness to become soldiers of the faith. Solemn
processions were made, and nothing was neglected either in public or
private, to show their willingness to be among the most forward to
assist the enterprise with money, counsel, or men. But the eagerness
for this crusade was somewhat abated, by learning that the Turkish army,
being at the siege of Belgrade, a strong city and fortress in Hungary,
upon the banks of the Danube, had been routed and the emperor wounded;
so that the alarm felt by the pope and all Christendom, on the loss
of Constantinople, having ceased to operate, they proceeded with
deliberately with their preparations for war; and in Hungary their
zeal was cooled through the death of Giovanni Corvini the Waiwode, who
commanded the Hungarian forces on that memorable occasion, and fell in
the battle.

To return to the affairs of Italy. In the year 1456, the disturbances
occasioned by Jacopo Piccinino having subsided, and human weapons
laid aside, the heavens seemed to make war against the earth; dreadful
tempestuous winds then occurring, which produced effects unprecedented
in Tuscany, and which to posterity will appear marvelous and
unaccountable. On the twenty-fourth of August, about an hour before
daybreak, there arose from the Adriatic near Ancona, a whirlwind, which
crossing from east to west, again reached the sea near Pisa, accompanied
by thick clouds, and the most intense and impenetrable darkness,
covering a breadth of about two miles in the direction of its course.
Under some natural or supernatural influence, this vast and overcharged
volume of condensed vapor burst; its fragments contended with
indescribable fury, and huge bodies sometimes ascending toward heaven,
and sometimes precipitated upon the earth, struggled, as it were,
in mutual conflict, whirling in circles with intense velocity, and
accompanied by winds, impetuous beyond all conception; while flashes of
awful brilliancy, and murky, lurid flames incessantly broke forth.
From these confused clouds, furious winds, and momentary fires, sounds
issued, of which no earthquake or thunder ever heard could afford the
least idea; striking such awe into all, that it was thought the end
of the world had arrived, that the earth, waters, heavens, and entire
universe, mingling together, were being resolved into their ancient
chaos. Wherever this awful tempest passed, it produced unprecedented and
marvelous effects; but these were more especially experienced near the
castle of St. Casciano, about eight miles from Florence, upon the hill
which separates the valleys of Pisa and Grieve. Between this castle and
the Borgo St. Andrea, upon the same hill, the tempest passed without
touching the latter, and in the former, only threw down some of the
battlements and the chimneys of a few houses; but in the space between
them, it leveled many buildings quite to the ground. The roofs of the
churches of St. Martin, at Bagnolo, and Santa Maria della Pace, were
carried more than a mile, unbroken as when upon their respective
edifices. A muleteer and his beasts were driven from the road into the
adjoining valley, and found dead. All the large oaks and lofty trees
which could not bend beneath its influence, were not only stripped of
their branches but borne to a great distance from the places where
they grew, and when the tempest had passed over and daylight made the
desolation visible, the inhabitants were transfixed with dismay. The
country had lost all its habitable character; churches and dwellings
were laid in heaps; nothing was heard but the lamentations of those
whose possessions had perished, or whose cattle or friends were buried
beneath the ruins; and all who witnessed the scene were filled with
anguish or compassion. It was doubtless the design of the Omnipotent,
rather to threaten Tuscany than to chastise her; for had the hurricane
been directed over the city, filled with houses and inhabitants,
instead of proceeding among oaks and elms, or small and thinly scattered
dwellings, it would have been such a scourge as the mind, with all its
ideas of horror, could not have conceived. But the Almighty desired
that this slight example should suffice to recall the minds of men to a
knowledge of himself and of his power.

To return to our history. King Alfonso was dissatisfied with the peace,
and as the war which he had unnecessarily caused Jacopo Piccinino to
make against the Siennese, had produced no important result, he resolved
to try what could be done against those whom the conditions of the
League permitted him to attack. He therefore, in the year 1456, assailed
the Genoese, both by sea and by land, designing to deprive the Fregosi
of the government and restore the Adorni. At the same time, he ordered
Jacopo Piccinino to cross the Tronto, and attack Gismondo Malatesti,
who, having fortified his territories, did not concern himself, and this
part of the king's enterprise produced no effect; but his proceedings
against Genoa occasioned more wars against himself and his kingdom than
he could have wished. Piero Fregoso was then doge of Genoa, and doubting
his ability to sustain the attack of the king, he determined to give
what he could not hold, to some one who might defend it against his
enemies, in hope, that at a future period, he should obtain a return for
the benefit conferred. He therefore sent ambassadors to Charles VII. of
France, and offered him the government of Genoa. Charles accepted the
offer, and sent John of Anjou, the son of King René, who had a short
time previously left Florence and returned to France, to take possession
with the idea, that he, having learned the manners and customs of Italy,
would be able to govern the city; and also that this might give him an
opportunity of undertaking the conquest of Naples, of which René, John's
father, had been deprived by Alfonso. John, therefore, proceeded to
Genoa, where he was received as prince, and the fortresses, both of the
city and the government, given up to him. This annoyed Alfonso, with the
fear that he had brought upon himself too powerful an enemy. He was not,
however, dismayed; but pursued his enterprise vigorously, and had led
his fleet to Porto, below Villamarina, when he died after a sudden
illness, and thus John and the Genoese were relieved from the war.
Ferrando, who succeeded to the kingdom of his father Alfonso, became
alarmed at having so powerful an enemy in Italy, and was doubtful of
the disposition of many of his barons, who being desirous of change, he
feared would take part with the French. He was also apprehensive of
the pope, whose ambition he well knew, and who seeing him new in the
government, might design to take it from him. He had no hope except
from the duke of Milan, who entertained no less anxiety concerning the
affairs of the kingdom than Ferrando; for he feared that if the French
were to obtain it, they would endeavor to annex his own dominions; which
he knew they considered to be rightfully their own. He, therefore, soon
after the death of Alfonso, sent letters and forces to Ferrando; the
latter to give him aid and influence, the former to encourage him with
an intimation that he would not, under any circumstances, forsake him.
The pontiff intended, after the death of Alfonso, to give the kingdom
of Naples to his nephew Piero Lodovico Borgia, and, to furnish a decent
pretext for his design and obtain the concurrence of the powers of Italy
in its favor he signified a wish to restore that realm to the dominion
of the church of Rome; and therefore persuaded the duke not to assist
Ferrando. But in the midst of these views and opening enterprises,
Calixtus died, and Pius II. of Siennese origin, of the family of the
Piccolomini, and by name Æneas, succeeded to the pontificate. This
pontiff, free from the ties of private interest, having no object but to
benefit Christendom and honor the church, at the duke's entreaty crowned
Ferrando king of Naples; judging it easier to establish peace if the
kingdom remained in the hands which at present held it, than if he were
to favor the views of the French, or, as Calixtus purposed, take it for
himself. Ferrando, in acknowledgment of the benefit, created Antonio,
one of the pope's nephews, prince of Malfi, gave him an illegitimate
daughter of his own in marriage, and restored Benevento and Terracina to
the church.

It thus appeared that the internal dissensions of Italy might be
quelled, and the pontiff prepared to induce the powers of Christendom
to unite in an enterprise against the Turks (as Calixtus had previously
designed) when differences arose between the Fregosi and John of Anjou,
the lord of Genoa, which occasioned greater and more important wars than
those recently concluded. Pietrino Fregoso was at his castle of Riviera,
and thought he had not been rewarded by John in proportion to his
family's merits; for it was by their means the latter had become prince
of the city. This impression drove the parties into open enmity; a
circumstance gratifying to Ferrando, who saw in it relief from his
troubles, and the sole means of procuring his safety: he therefore
assisted Pietrino with money and men, trusting to drive John out of the
Genoese territory. The latter being aware of his design, sent for aid
to France; and, on obtaining it, attacked Pietrino, who, through his
numerous friends, entertained the strongest assurance of success; so
that John was compelled to keep within the city, into which Pietrino
having entered by night, took possession of some parts of it; but upon
the return of day, his people were all either slain or made prisoners by
John's troops, and he himself was found among the dead.

This victory gave John hopes of recovering the kingdom; and in October,
1459, he sailed thither from Genoa, with a powerful fleet, and landed
at Baia; whence he proceeded to Sessa, by the duke of which place he was
favorably received. The prince of Taranto, the Aquilani, with several
cities and other princes, also joined him; so that a great part of the
kingdom fell into his hands. On this Ferrando applied for assistance
to the pope and the duke of Milan; and, to diminish the number of his
enemies, made peace with Gismondo Malatesti, which gave so much offense
to Jacopo Piccinino, the hereditary enemy of Gismondo, that he resigned
his command under Ferrando, and joined his rival. Ferrando also sent
money to Federigo, lord of Urbino, and collected with all possible speed
what was in those times considered a tolerable army; which, meeting the
enemy upon the river Sarni, an engagement ensued in which Ferrando was
routed, and many of his principal officers taken. After this defeat, the
city of Naples alone, with a few smaller places and princes of inferior
note, adhered to Ferrando, the greater part having submitted to John.
Jacopo Piccinino, after the victory, advised an immediate march upon
Naples; but John declined this, saying, he would first reduce the
remainder of the kingdom, and then attack the seat of government. This
resolution occasioned the failure of his enterprise; for he did not
consider how much more easily the members follow the head than the head
the members.

After his defeat, Ferrando took refuge in Naples, whither the scattered
remnants of his people followed him; and by soliciting his friends, he
obtained money and a small force. He sent again for assistance to the
pope and the duke, by both of whom he was supplied more liberally
and speedily than before; for they began to entertain most serious
apprehensions of his losing the kingdom. His hopes were thus revived;
and, marching from Naples, he regained his reputation in his dominions,
and soon obtained the places of which he had been deprived. While the
war was proceeding in the kingdom, a circumstance occurred by which
John of Anjou lost his influence, and all chance of success in
the enterprise. The Genoese had become so weary of the haughty and
avaricious dominion of the French, that they took arms against the
viceroy, and compelled him to seek refuge in the castelletto; the
Fregosi and the Adorni united in the enterprise against him, and were
assisted with money and troops by the duke of Milan, both for the
recovery and preservation of the government. At the same time, King René
coming with a fleet to the assistance of his son, and hoping to recover
Genoa by means of the castelletto, upon landing his forces was so
completely routed, that he was compelled to return in disgrace to
Provence. When the news of his father's defeat reached Naples, John was
greatly alarmed, but continued the war for a time by the assistance of
those barons who, being rebels, knew they would obtain no terms from
Ferrando. At length, after various trifling occurrences, the two royal
armies came to an engagement, in which John was routed near Troia, in
the year 1463. He was, however, less injured by his defeat than by the
desertion of Jacopo Piccinino, who joined Ferrando; and, being abandoned
by his troops, he was compelled to take refuge in Istria, and thence
withdrew to France. This war continued four years. John's failure was
attributable to negligence; for victory was often within his grasp,
but he did not take proper means to secure it. The Florentines took no
decisive part in this war. John, king of Aragon, who succeeded upon the
death of Alfonso, sent ambassadors to request their assistance for his
nephew Ferrando, in compliance with the terms of the treaty recently
made with his father Alfonso. The Florentines replied, that they were
under no obligation; that they did not think proper to assist the son
in a war commenced by the father with his own forces; and that as it was
begun without either their counsel or knowledge, it must be continued
and concluded without their help. The ambassadors affirmed the
engagement to be binding on the Florentines, and themselves to be
answerable for the event of the war; and then in great anger left the
city.

Thus with regard to external affairs, the Florentines continued
tranquil during this war; but the case was otherwise with their domestic
concerns, as will be particularly shown in the following book.

prudence--Sayings of Cosmo.

It will perhaps appear to the readers of the preceding book that,
professing only to write of the affairs of Florence, I have dilated too
much in speaking of those which occurred in Lombardy and Naples. But
as I have not already avoided, so it is not my intention in future to
forbear, similar digressions. For although we have not engaged to
give an account of the affairs of Italy, still it would be improper
to neglect noticing the most remarkable of them. If they were wholly
omitted, our history would not be so well understood, neither would it
be so instructive or agreeable; since from the proceedings of the other
princes and states of Italy, have most commonly arisen those wars in
which the Florentines were compelled to take part. Thus, from the
war between John of Anjou and King Ferrando, originated those serious
enmities and hatreds which ensued between Ferrando and the Florentines,
particularly the house of Medici. The king complained of a want of
assistance during the war, and of the aid afforded to his enemy; and
from his anger originated the greatest evils, as will be hereafter seen.
Having, in speaking of external affairs, come down to the year 1463, it
will be necessary in order to make our narrative of the contemporaneous
domestic transactions clearly understood, to revert to a period several
years back. But first, according to custom, I would offer a few remarks
referring to the events about to be narrated, and observe, that those
who think a republic may be kept in perfect unity of purpose are greatly
deceived. True it is, that some divisions injure republics, while others
are beneficial to them. When accompanied by factions and parties they
are injurious; but when maintained without them they contribute to their
prosperity. The legislator of a republic, since it is impossible to
prevent the existence of dissensions, must at least take care to prevent
the growth of faction. It may therefore be observed, that citizens
acquire reputation and power in two ways; the one public, the other
private. Influence is acquired publicly by winning a battle, taking
possession of a territory, fulfilling the duties of an embassy with
care and prudence, or by giving wise counsel attended by a happy result.
Private methods are conferring benefits upon individuals, defending them
against the magistrates, supporting them with money, and raising them to
undeserved honors; or with public games and entertainments gaining the
affection of the populace. This mode of procedure produces parties and
cliques; and in proportion as influence thus acquired is injurious, so
is the former beneficial, if quite free from party spirit; because it is
founded upon the public good, and not upon private advantage. And though
it is impossible to prevent the existence of inveterate feuds, still
if they be without partisans to support them for their own individual
benefit, they do not injure a republic, but contribute to its welfare;
since none can attain distinction, but as he contributes to her good,
and each party prevents the other from infringing her liberties. The
dissensions of Florence were always accompanied by factions, and were
therefore always pernicious; and the dominant party only remained united
so long as its enemies held it in check. As soon as the strength of the
opposition was annihilated, the government, deprived of the restraining
influence of its adversaries, and being subject to no law, fell to
pieces. The party of Cosmo de' Medici gained the ascendant in 1434; but
the depressed party being very numerous, and composed of several very
influential persons, fear kept the former united, and restrained their
proceedings within the bounds of moderation, so that no violence was
committed by them, nor anything done calculated to excite popular
dislike. Consequently, whenever this government required the citizens'
aid to recover or strengthen its influence, the latter were always
willing to gratify its wishes; so that from 1434 to 1455, during a
period of twenty-one years, the authority of a balia was granted to it
six times.

There were in Florence, as we have frequently observed, two principally
powerful citizens, Cosmo de' Medici and Neri Capponi. Neri acquired
his influence by public services; so that he had many friends but few
partisans. Cosmo, being able to avail himself both of public and private
means, had many partisans as well as friends. While both lived,
having always been united, they obtained from the people whatever they
required; for in them popularity and power were united. But in the year
1455, Neri being dead, and the opposition party extinct, the government
found a difficulty in resuming its authority; and this was occasioned,
remarkably enough, by Cosmo's private friends, and the most influential
men in the state; for, not fearing the opposite party, they became
anxious to abate his power. This inconsistency was the beginning of
the evils which took place in 1456; so that those in power were openly
advised in the deliberative councils not to renew the power of the
balia, but to close the balloting purses, and appoint the magistrates by
drawing from the pollings or squittini previously made. To restrain this
disposition, Cosmo had the choice of two alternatives, either forcibly
to assume the government, with the partisans he possessed, and drive
out the others, or to allow the matter to take its course, and let his
friends see they were not depriving him of power, but rather themselves.
He chose the latter; for he well knew that at all events the purses
being filled with the names of his own friends, he incurred no risk, and
could take the government into his own hands whenever he found occasion.
The chief offices of state being again filled by lot, the mass of the
people began to think they had recovered their liberty, and that the
decisions of the magistrates were according to their own judgments,
unbiased by the influence of the Great. At the same time, the friends
of different grandees were humbled; and many who had commonly seen their
houses filled with suitors and presents, found themselves destitute of
both. Those who had previously been very powerful were reduced to an
equality with men whom they had been accustomed to consider inferior;
and those formerly far beneath them were now become their equals. No
respect or deference was paid to them; they were often ridiculed and
derided, and frequently heard themselves and the republic mentioned in
the open streets without the least deference; thus they found it was not
Cosmo but themselves that had lost the government. Cosmo appeared not to
notice these matters; and whenever any subject was proposed in favor
of the people he was the first to support it. But the greatest cause
of alarm to the higher classes, and his most favorable opportunity of
retaliation, was the revival of the catasto, or property-tax of 1427, so
that individual contributions were determined by statute, and not by a
set of persons appointed for its regulation.

This law being re-established, and a magistracy created to carry it into
effect, the nobility assembled, and went to Cosmo to beg he would rescue
them and himself from the power of the plebeians, and restore to the
government the reputation which had made himself powerful and them
respected. He replied, he was willing to comply with their request, but
wished the law to be obtained in the regular manner, by consent of the
people, and not by force, of which he would not hear on any account.
They then endeavored in the councils to establish a new balia, but did
not succeed. On this the grandees again came to Cosmo, and most humbly
begged he would assemble the people in a general council or parliament,
but this he refused, for he wished to make them sensible of their great
mistake; and when Donato Cocchi, being Gonfalonier of Justice, proposed
to assemble them without his consent, the Signors who were of Cosmo's
party ridiculed the idea so unmercifully, that the man's mind actually
became deranged, and he had to retire from office in consequence.
However, since it is undesirable to allow matters to proceed beyond
recovery, the Gonfalon of Justice being in the hands of Luca Pitti,
a bold-spirited man, Cosmo determined to let him adopt what course he
thought proper, that if any trouble should arise it might be imputed
to Luca and not to himself. Luca, therefore, in the beginning of his
magistracy, several times proposed to the people the appointment of
a new balia; and, not succeeding, he threatened the members of the
councils with injurious and arrogant expressions, which were shortly
followed by corresponding conduct; for in the month of August, 1458, on
the eve of Saint Lorenzo, having filled the piazza, and compelled
them to assent to a measure to which he knew them to be averse. Having
recovered power, created a new balia, and filled the principal offices
according to the pleasure of a few individuals, in order to commence
that government with terror which they had obtained by force, they
banished Girolamo Machiavelli, with some others, and deprived many of
the honors of government. Girolamo, having transgressed the confines to
which he was limited, was declared a rebel. Traveling about Italy, with
the design of exciting the princes against his country, he was betrayed
while at Lunigiana, and, being brought to Florence, was put to death in
prison.

This government, during the eight years it continued, was violent and
insupportable; for Cosmo, being now old, and through ill health unable
to attend to public affairs as formerly, Florence became a prey to a
small number of her own citizens. Luca Pitti, in return for the services
he had performed for the republic, as made a knight, and to be no less
grateful than those who had conferred the dignity upon him, he ordered
that the priors, who had hitherto been called priors of the trades,
should also have a name to which they had no kind of claim, and
therefore called them priors of liberty. He also ordered, that as it
had been customary for the gonfalonier to sit upon the right hand of
the rectors, he should in future take his seat in the midst of them. And
that the Deity might appear to participate in what had been done, public
processions were made and solemn services performed, to thank him for
the recovery of the government. The Signory and Cosmo made Luca Pitti
rich presents, and all the citizens were emulous in imitation of them;
so that the money given amounted to no less a sum than twenty thousand
ducats. He thus attained such influence, that not Cosmo but himself now
governed the city; and his pride so increased, that he commenced two
superb buildings, one in Florence, the other at Ruciano, about a mile
distant, both in a style of royal magnificence; that in the city, being
larger than any hitherto built by a private person. To complete them, he
had recourse to the most extraordinary means; for not only citizens and
private individuals made him presents and supplied materials, but the
mass of people, of every grade, also contributed. Besides this, any
exiles who had committed murders, thefts, or other crimes which made
them amenable to the laws, found a safe refuge within their walls, if
they were able to contribute toward their decoration or completion. The
other citizens, though they did not build like him, were no less violent
or rapacious, so that if Florence were not harassed by external wars,
she was ruined by the wickedness of her own children. During this period
the wars of Naples took place. The pope also commenced hostilities in
Romagna against the Malatesti, from whom he wished to take Rimino and
Cesena, held by them. In these designs, and his intentions of a crusade
against the Turks, was passed the pontificate of Pius II.

Florence continued in disunion and disturbance. The dissensions
continued among the party of Cosmo, in 1455, from the causes already
related, which by his prudence, as we have also before remarked, he was
enabled to tranquilize; but in the year 1464, his illness increased,
and he died. Friends and enemies alike grieved for his loss; for his
political opponents, perceiving the rapacity of the citizens, even
during the life of him who alone restrained them and made their tyranny
supportable, were afraid, lest after his decease, nothing but ruin would
ensue. Nor had they much hope of his son Piero, who though a very good
man, was of infirm health, and new in the government, and they thought
he would be compelled to give way; so that, being unrestrained, their
rapacity would pass all bounds. On these accounts, the regret was
universal. Of all who have left memorials behind them, and who were not
of the military profession, Cosmo was the most illustrious and the most
renowned. He not only surpassed all his contemporaries in wealth and
authority, but also in generosity and prudence; and among the qualities
which contributed to make him prince in his own country, was his
surpassing all others in magnificence and generosity. His liberality
became more obvious after his death, when Piero, his son, wishing
to know what he possessed, it appeared there was no citizen of any
consequence to whom Cosmo had not lent a large sum of money; and often,
when informed of some nobleman being in distress, he relieved him
unasked. His magnificence is evident from the number of public edifices
he erected; for in Florence are the convents and churches of St. Marco
and St. Lorenzo, and the monastery of Santa Verdiana; in the mountains
of Fiesole, the church and abbey of St. Girolamo; and in the Mugello, he
not only restored, but rebuilt from its foundation, a monastery of the
Frati Minori, or Minims. Besides these, in the church of Santa Croce,
the Servi, the Agnoli, and in San Miniato, he erected splendid chapels
and altars; and besides building the churches and chapels we have
mentioned, he provided them with all the ornaments, furniture, and
utensils suitable for the performance of divine service. To these sacred
edifices are to be added his private dwellings, one in Florence, of
extent and elegance adapted to so great a citizen, and four others,
situated at Careggi, Fiesole, Craggiulo, and Trebbio, each, for size and
grandeur, equal to royal palaces. And, as if it were not sufficient
to be distinguished for magnificence of buildings in Italy alone, he
erected an hospital at Jerusalem, for the reception of poor and infirm
pilgrims. Although his habitations, like all his other works and
actions, were quite of a regal character, and he alone was prince in
Florence, still everything was so tempered with his prudence, that
he never transgressed the decent moderation of civil life; in his
conversation, his servants, his traveling, his mode of living, and the
relationships he formed, the modest demeanor of the citizen was always
evident; for he was aware that a constant exhibition of pomp brings
more envy upon its possessor than greater realities borne without
ostentation. Thus in selecting consorts for his sons, he did not
seek the alliance of princes, but for Giovanni chose Corneglia degli
Allesandri, and for Piero, Lucrezia de' Tornabuoni. He gave his
granddaughters, the children of Piero, Bianca to Guglielmo de' Pazzi,
and Nannina to Bernardo Ruccellai. No one of his time possessed such an
intimate knowledge of government and state affairs as himself; and hence
amid such a variety of fortune, in a city so given to change, and among
a people of such extreme inconstancy, he retained possession of the
government thirty-one years; for being endowed with the utmost prudence,
he foresaw evils at a distance, and therefore had an opportunity either
of averting them, or preventing their injurious results. He thus not
only vanquished domestic and civil ambition, but humbled the pride of
many princes with so much fidelity and address, that whatever powers
were in league with himself and his country, either overcame their
adversaries, or remained uninjured by his alliance; and whoever were
opposed to him, lost either their time, money, or territory. Of this
the Venetians afford a sufficient proof, who, while in league with him
against Duke Filippo were always victorious, but apart from him were
always conquered; first by Filippo and then by Francesco. When they
joined Alfonso against the Florentine republic, Cosmo, by his commercial
credit, so drained Naples and Venice of money, that they were glad to
obtain peace upon any terms it was thought proper to grant. Whatever
difficulties he had to contend with, whether within the city or without,
he brought to a happy issue, at once glorious to himself and destructive
to his enemies; so that civil discord strengthened his government in
Florence, and war increased his power and reputation abroad. He added
to the Florentine dominions, the Borgo of St. Sepolcro, Montedoglio, the
Casentino and Val di Bagno. His virtue and good fortune overcame all his
enemies and exalted his friends. He was born in the year 1389, on the
day of the saints Cosmo and Damiano. His earlier years were full of
trouble, as his exile, captivity, and personal danger fully testify;
and having gone to the council of Constance, with Pope John, in order to
save his life, after the ruin of the latter, he was obliged to escape in
disguise. But after the age of forty, he enjoyed the greatest felicity;
and not only those who assisted him in public business, but his
agents who conducted his commercial speculations throughout Europe,
participated in his prosperity. Hence many enormous fortunes took their
origin in different families of Florence, as in that of the Tornabuoni,
the Benci, the Portinari, and the Sassetti. Besides these, all who
depended upon his advice and patronage became rich; and, though he
was constantly expending money in building churches, and in charitable
purposes, he sometimes complained to his friends that he had never been
able to lay out so much in the service of God as to find the balance in
his own favor, intimating that all he had done or could do, was still
unequal to what the Almighty had done for him. He was of middle stature,
olive complexion, and venerable aspect; not learned but exceedingly
eloquent, endowed with great natural capacity, generous to his friends,
kind to the poor, comprehensive in discourse, cautious in advising,
and in his speeches and replies, grave and witty. When Rinaldo degli
Albizzi, at the beginning of his exile, sent to him to say, "the hen had
laid," he replied, "she did ill to lay so far from the nest." Some other
of the rebels gave him to understand they were "not dreaming." He said,
"he believed it, for he had robbed them of their sleep." When Pope
Pius was endeavoring to induce the different governments to join in
an expedition against the Turks, he said, "he was an old man, and had
undertaken the enterprise of a young one." To the Venetians ambassadors,
who came to Florence with those of King Alfonso to complain of the
republic, he uncovered his head, and asked them what color it was; they
said, "white;" he replied, "it is so; and it will not be long before
your senators have heads as white as mine." A few hours before his
death, his wife asked him why he kept his eyes shut, and he said, "to
get them in the way of it." Some citizens saying to him, after his
return from exile, that he injured the city, and that it was offensive
to God to drive so many religious persons out of it; he replied that,
"it was better to injure the city, than to ruin it; that two yards
of rose-colored cloth would make a gentleman, and that it required
something more to direct a government than to play with a string of
beads." These words gave occasion to his enemies to slander him, as a
man who loved himself more than his country, and was more attached
to this world than to the next. Many others of his sayings might be
adduced, but we shall omit them as unnecessary. Cosmo was a friend and
patron of learned men. He brought Argiripolo, a Greek by birth, and one
of the most erudite of his time, to Florence, to instruct the youth in
Hellenic literature. He entertained Marsilio Ficino, the reviver of the
Platonic philosophy, in his own house; and being much attached to him,
have him a residence near his palace at Careggi, that he might pursue
the study of letters with greater convenience, and himself have an
opportunity of enjoying his company. His prudence, his great wealth, the
uses to which he applied it, and his splendid style of living, caused
him to be beloved and respected in Florence, and obtained for him the
highest consideration, not only among the princes and governments of
Italy, but throughout all Europe. He thus laid a foundation for his
descendants, which enabled them to equal him in virtue, and greatly
surpass him in fortune; while the authority they possessed in Florence
and throughout Christendom was not obtained without being merited.
Toward the close of his life he suffered great affliction; for, of his
two sons, Piero and Giovanni, the latter, of whom he entertained the
greatest hopes, died; and the former was so sickly as to be unable to
attend either to public or private business. On being carried from
one apartment to another, after Giovanni's death, he remarked to his
attendants, with a sigh, "This is too large a house for so small a
family." His great mind also felt distressed at the idea that he had not
extended the Florentine dominions by any valuable acquisition; and he
regretted it the more, from imagining he had been deceived by Francesco
Sforza, who, while count, had promised, that if he became lord of Milan,
he would undertake the conquest of Lucca for the Florentines, a design,
however, that was never realized; for the count's ideas changed upon his
becoming duke; he resolved to enjoy in peace, the power he had acquired
by war, and would not again encounter its fatigues and dangers, unless
the welfare of his own dominions required it. This was a source of much
annoyance to Cosmo, who felt he had incurred great expense and trouble
for an ungrateful and perfidious friend. His bodily infirmities
prevented him from attending either to public or private affairs, as he
had been accustomed, and he consequently witnessed both going to decay;
for Florence was ruined by her own citizens, and his fortune by his
agents and children. He died, however, at the zenith of his glory and
in the enjoyment of the highest renown. The city, and all the Christian
princes, condoled with his son Piero for his loss. His funeral was
conducted with the utmost pomp and solemnity, the whole city following
his corpse to the tomb in the church of St. Lorenzo, on which, by public
decree, he was inscribed, "FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY." If, in speaking of
Cosmo's actions, I have rather imitated the biographies of princes than
general history, it need not occasion wonder; for of so extraordinary an
individual I was compelled to speak with unusual praise.



CHAPTER II

The duke of Milan becomes lord of Genoa--The king of Naples and the
duke of Milan endeavor to secure their dominions to their heirs--Jacopo
Piccinino honorably received at Milan, and shortly afterward murdered
at Naples--Fruitless endeavors of Pius II. to excite Christendom against
the Turks--Death of Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan--Perfidious counsel
given to Piero de' Medici by Diotisalvi Neroni--Conspiracy of
Diotisalvi and others against Piero--Futile attempts to appease the
disorders--Public spectacles--Projects of the conspirators against Piero
de' Medici--Niccolo Fedini discloses to Piero the plots of his enemies.

While Florence and Italy were in this condition, Louis XI. of France
was involved in very serious troubles with his barons, who, with the
assistance of Francis, duke of Brittany, and Charles, duke of Burgundy,
were in arms against him. This attack was so serious, that he was unable
to render further assistance to John of Anjou in his enterprise against
Genoa and Naples; and, standing in need of all the forces he could
raise, he gave over Savona (which still remained in the power of the
French) to the duke of Milan, and also intimated, that if he wished,
he had his permission to undertake the conquest of Genoa. Francesco
accepted the proposal, and with the influence afforded by the king's
friendship, and the assistance of the Adorni, he became lord of Genoa.
In acknowledgment of this benefit, he sent fifteen hundred horse into
France for the king's service, under the command of Galeazzo, his eldest
son. Thus Ferrando of Aragon and Francesco Sforza became, the latter,
duke of Lombardy and prince of Genoa, and the former, sovereign of the
whole kingdom of Naples. Their families being allied by marriage, they
thought they might so confirm their power as to secure to themselves its
enjoyment during life, and at their deaths, its unencumbered reversion
to their heirs. To attain this end, they considered it necessary that
the king should remove all ground of apprehension from those barons who
had offended him in the war of John of Anjou, and that the duke should
extirpate the adherents of the Bracceschi, the natural enemies of
his family, who, under Jacopo Piccinino, had attained the highest
reputation. The latter was now the first general in Italy, and
possessing no territory, he naturally excited the apprehension of all
who had dominions, and especially of the duke, who, conscious of what
he had himself done, thought he could neither enjoy his own estate in
safety, nor leave them with any degree of security to his son during
Jacopo's lifetime. The king, therefore, strenuously endeavored to come
to terms with his barons, and using his utmost ingenuity to secure them,
succeeded in his object; for they perceived their ruin to be inevitable
if they continued in war with their sovereign, though from submission
and confidence in him, they would still have reason for apprehension.
Mankind are always most eager to avoid a certain evil; and hence
inferior powers are easily deceived by princes. The barons, conscious
of the danger of continuing the war, trusted the king's promises, and
having placed themselves in his hands, they were soon after destroyed
in various ways, and under a variety of pretexts. This alarmed Jacopo
Piccinino, who was with his forces at Sulmona; and to deprive the king
of the opportunity of treating him similarly, he endeavored, by the
mediation of his friends, to be reconciled with the duke, who, by the
most liberal offers, induced Jacopo to visit him at Milan, accompanied
by only a hundred horse.

Jacopo had served many years with his father and brother, first under
Duke Filippo, and afterward under the Milanese republic, so that by
frequent intercourse with the citizens he had acquired many friends and
universal popularity, which present circumstances tended to increase;
for the prosperity and newly acquired power of the Sforzeschi had
occasioned envy, while Jacopo's misfortunes and long absence had given
rise to compassion and a great desire to see him. These various feelings
were displayed upon his arrival; for nearly all the nobility went to
meet him; the streets through which he passed were filled with citizens,
anxious to catch a glimpse of him, while shouts of "The Bracceschi! the
Bracceschi!" resounded on all sides. These honors accelerated his ruin;
for the duke's apprehensions increased his desire of destroying him; and
to effect this with the least possible suspicion, Jacopo's marriage with
Drusiana, the duke's natural daughter, was now celebrated. The duke then
arranged with Ferrando to take him into pay, with the title of captain
of his forces, and give him 100,000 florins for his maintenance. After
this agreement, Jacopo, accompanied by a ducal ambassador and his wife
Drusiana, proceeded to Naples, where he was honorably and joyfully
received, and for many days entertained with every kind of festivity;
but having asked permission to go to Sulmona, where his forces were, the
king invited him to a banquet in the castle, at the conclusion of which
he and his son Francesco were imprisoned, and shortly afterward put to
death. It was thus our Italian princes, fearing those virtues in others
which they themselves did not possess, extirpated them; and hence the
country became a prey to the efforts of those by whom it was not long
afterward oppressed and ruined.

At this time, Pope Pius II. having settled the affairs of Romagna, and
witnessing a universal peace, thought it a suitable opportunity to lead
the Christians against the Turks, and adopted measures similar to those
which his predecessors had used. All the princes promised assistance
either in men or money; while Matthias, king of Hungary, and Charles,
duke of Burgundy, intimated their intention of joining the enterprise
in person, and were by the pope appointed leaders of the expedition. The
pontiff was so full of expectation, that he left Rome and proceeded
to Ancona, where it had been arranged that the whole army should be
assembled, and the Venetians engaged to send ships thither to convey the
forces to Sclavonia. Upon the arrival of the pope in that city,
there was soon such a concourse of people, that in a few days all
the provisions it contained, or that could be procured from the
neighborhood, were consumed, and famine began to impend. Besides this,
there was no money to provide those who were in want of it, nor arms
to furnish such as were without them. Neither Matthias nor Charles made
their appearance. The Venetians sent a captain with some galleys, but
rather for ostentation and the sake of keeping their word, than for the
purpose of conveying troops. During this position of affairs, the pope,
being old and infirm, died, and the assembled troops returned to their
homes. The death of the pontiff occurred in 1465, and Paul II. of
Venetian origin, was chosen to succeed him; and that nearly all the
principalities of Italy might change their rulers about the same period,
in the following year Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, also died, having
occupied the dukedom sixteen years, and Galleazzo, his son, succeeded
him.

The death of this prince infused redoubled energy into the Florentine
dissensions, and caused them to produce more prompt effects than they
would otherwise have done. Upon the demise of Cosmo, his son Piero,
being heir to the wealth and government of his father, called to his
assistance Diotisalvi Neroni, a man of great influence and the highest
reputation, in whom Cosmo reposed so much confidence that just before
his death he recommended Piero to be wholly guided by him, both with
regard to the government of the city and the management of his fortune.
Piero acquired Diotisalvi with the opinion Cosmo entertained of him,
and said that as he wished to obey his father, though now no more, as
he always had while alive, he should consult him concerning both his
patrimony and the city. Beginning with his private affairs, he caused
an account of all his property, liabilities, and assets, to be placed in
Diotisalvi's hands, that, with an entire acquaintance with the state of
his affairs, he might be able to afford suitable advice, and the latter
promised to use the utmost care. Upon examination of these accounts the
affairs were found to be in great disorder, and Diotisalvi, instigated
rather by his own ambition than by attachment to Piero or gratitude
to Cosmo, thought he might without difficulty deprive him of both
the reputation and the splendor which his father had left him as his
inheritance. In order to realize his views, he waited upon Piero, and
advised him to adopt a measure which, while it appeared quite correct in
itself, and suitable to existing circumstances, involved a consequence
destructive to his authority. He explained the disorder of his affairs,
and the large amount of money it would be necessary to provide, if he
wished to preserve his influence in the state and his reputation of
wealth; and said there was no other means of remedying these disorders
so just and available as to call in the sums which his father had lent
to an infinite number of persons, both foreigners and citizens;
for Cosmo, to acquire partisans in Florence and friends abroad, was
extremely liberal of his money, and the amount of loans due to him was
enormous. Piero thought the advice good, because he was only desirous to
repossess his own property to meet the demands to which he was liable;
but as soon as he had ordered those amounts to be recalled, the
citizens, as if he had asked for something to which he had no kind of
claim, took great offense, loaded him with opprobrious expressions, and
accused him of being avaricious and ungrateful.

Diotisalvi, noticing the popular excitement against Piero, occasioned
by his own advice, obtained an interview with Luca Pitti, Agnolo
Acciajuoli, and Niccolo Soderini, and they resolved to unite their
efforts to deprive him both of the government and his influence. Each
was actuated by a different motive; Luca Pitti wished to take the
position Cosmo had occupied, for he was now become so great, that he
disdained to submit to Piero; Diotisalvi Neroni, who knew Luca unfit
to be at the head of a government, thought that of necessity on Piero's
removal, the whole authority of the state would devolve upon himself;
Niccolo Soderini desired the city to enjoy greater liberty, and for
the laws to be equally binding upon all. Agnolo Acciajuoli was greatly
incensed against the Medici, for the following reasons: his son,
Raffaello, had some time before married Alessandra de' Bardi, and
received with her a large dowry. She, either by her own fault or
the misconduct of others, suffered much ill-treatment both from her
father-in-law and her husband, and in consequence Lorenzo d' Ilarione,
her kinsman, out of pity for the girl, being accompanied by several
armed men, took her away from Agnolo's house. The Acciajuoli complained
of the injury done them by the Bardi, and the matter was referred to
Cosmo, who decided that the Acciajuoli should restore to Alessandra her
fortune, and then leave it to her choice either to return to her husband
or not. Agnolo thought Cosmo had not, in this instance, treated him as
a friend; and having been unable to avenge himself on the father, he now
resolved to do his utmost to ruin the son. These conspirators, though
each was influenced by a different motive from the rest, affected to
have only one object in view, which was that the city should be governed
by the magistrates, and not be subjected to the counsels of a few
individuals. The odium against Piero, and opportunities of injuring him,
were increased by the number of merchants who failed about this time;
for it was reported that he, in having, quite unexpectedly to all,
resolved to call in his debts, had, to the disgrace and ruin of the
city, caused them to become insolvent. To this was added his endeavor
to obtain Clarice degli Orsini as wife of Lorenzo, his eldest son; and
hence his enemies took occasion to say, it was quite clear, that as he
despised a Florentine alliance, he no longer considered himself one of
the people, and was preparing to make himself prince; for he who refuses
his fellow-citizens as relatives, desires to make them slaves, and
therefore cannot expect to have them as friends. The leaders of the
sedition thought they had the victory in their power; for the greater
part of the citizens followed them, deceived by the name of liberty
which they, to give their purpose a graceful covering, adopted upon
their ensigns.

In this agitated state of the city, some, to whom civil discord was
extremely offensive, thought it would be well to endeavor to engage
men's minds with some new occupation, because when unemployed they
are commonly led by whoever chooses to excite them. To divert their
attention from matters of government, it being now a year since the
death of Cosmo, it was resolved to celebrate two festivals, similar to
the most solemn observed in the city. At one of them was represented
the arrival of the three kings from the east, led by the star which
announced the nativity of Christ; which was conducted with such pomp and
magnificence, that the preparations for it kept the whole city occupied
many months. The other was a tournament (for so they call the exhibition
of equestrian combats), in which the sons of the first families in the
city took part with the most celebrated cavaliers of Italy. Among the
most distinguished of the Florentine youth was Lorenzo, eldest son of
Piero, who, not by favor, but by his own personal valor, obtained the
principal prize. When these festivals were over, the citizens reverted
to the same thoughts which had previously occupied them, and each
pursued his ideas with more earnestness than ever. Serious differences
and troubles were the result; and these were greatly increased by two
circumstances: one of which was, that the authority of the balia had
expired; the other, that upon the death of Duke Francesco, Galeazzo the
new duke sent ambassadors to Florence, to renew the engagements of his
father with the city, which, among other things, provided that every
year a certain sum of money should be paid to the duke. The principal
opponents of the Medici took occasion, from this demand, to make public
resistance in the councils, on pretense that the alliance was made with
Francesco and not Galeazzo; so that Francesco being dead, the obligation
had ceased; nor was there any necessity to revive it, because Galeazzo
did not possess his father's talents, and consequently they neither
could nor ought to expect the same benefits from him; that if they had
derived little advantage from Francesco, they would obtain still less
from Galeazzo; and that if any citizen wished to hire him for his own
purposes, it was contrary to civil rule, and inconsistent with the
public liberty. Piero, on the contrary, argued that it would be very
impolitic to lose such an alliance from mere avarice, and that there
was nothing so important to the republic, and to the whole of Italy,
as their alliance with the duke; that the Venetians, while they were
united, could not hope either by feigned friendship or open war
to injure the duchy; but as soon as they perceived the Florentines
alienated from him they would prepare for hostilities, and, finding him
young, new in the government, and without friends, they would, either
by force or fraud, compel him to join them; in which case ruin of the
republic would be inevitable.

The arguments of Piero were without effect, and the animosity of the
parties began to be openly manifested in their nocturnal assemblies; the
friends of the Medici meeting in the Crocetta, and their adversaries in
the Pieta. The latter being anxious for Piero's ruin, had induced many
citizens to subscribe their names as favorable to the undertaking. Upon
one occasion, particularly when considering the course to be adopted,
although all agreed that the power of the Medici ought to be reduced,
different opinions were given concerning the means by which it should be
effected; one party, the most temperate and reasonable, held that as the
authority of the balia had ceased, they must take care to prevent
its renewal; it would then be found to be the universal wish that the
magistrates and councils should govern the city, and in a short time
Piero's power would be visibly diminished, and, as a consequence of his
loss of influence in the government, his commercial credit would also
fail; for his affairs were in such a state, that if they could prevent
him from using the public money his ruin must ensue. They would thus
be in no further danger from him, and would succeed in the recovery of
their liberty, without the death or exile of any individual; but if
they attempted violence they would incur great dangers; for mankind
are willing to allow one who falls of himself to meet his fate, but if
pushed down they would hasten to his relief; so that if they adopted no
extraordinary measures against him, he will have no reason for defense
or aid; and if he were to seek them it would be greatly to his own
injury, by creating such a general suspicion as would accelerate his
ruin, and justify whatever course they might think proper to adopt. Many
of the assembly were dissatisfied with this tardy method of proceeding;
they thought delay would be favorable to him and injurious to
themselves; for if they allowed matters to take their ordinary course,
Piero would be in no danger whatever, while they themselves would incur
many; for the magistrates who were opposed to him would allow him to
rule the city, and his friends would make him a prince, and their own
ruin would be inevitable, as happened in 1458; and though the advice
they had just heard might be most consistent with good feeling, the
present would be found to be the safest. That it would therefore be
best, while the minds of men were yet excited against him, to effect
his destruction. It must be their plan to arm themselves, and engage the
assistance of the marquis of Ferrara, that they might not be destitute
of troops; and if a favorable Signory were drawn, they would be in
condition to make use of them. They therefore determined to wait the
formation of the new Signory, and be governed by circumstances.

Among the conspirators was Niccolo Fedini, who had acted as president of
their assemblies. He, being induced by most certain hopes, disclosed the
whole affair to Piero, and gave him a list of those who had subscribed
their names, and also of the conspirators. Piero was alarmed on
discovering the number and quality of those who were opposed to him; and
by the advice of his friends he resolved to take the signatures of those
who were inclined to favor him. Having employed one of his most
trusty confidants to carry his design into effect, he found so great a
disposition to change and instability, that many who had previously set
down their names among the number of his enemies, now subscribed them in
his favor.

Niccolo Soderini drawn Gonfalonier of Justice--Great hopes excited in
consequence--The two parties take arms--The fears of the Signory--Their
conduct with regard to Piero--Piero's reply to the Signory--Reform of
government in favor of Piero de' Medici--Dispersion of his enemies--Fall

make war on Florence.

In the midst of these events, the time arrived for the renewal of
the supreme magistracy; and Niccolo Soderini was drawn Gonfalonier
of Justice. It was surprising to see by what a concourse, not only of
distinguished citizens, but also of the populace, he was accompanied to
the palace; and while on the way thither an olive wreath was placed upon
his head, to signify that upon him depended the safety and liberty
of the city. This, among many similar instances, serves to prove how
undesirable it is to enter upon office or power exciting inordinate
expectations; for, being unable to fulfil them (many looking for more
than it is possible to perform), shame and disappointment are the
ordinary results. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini were brothers. Niccolo
was the more ardent and spirited, Tommaso the wiser man; who, being very
much the friend of Piero, and knowing that his brother desired nothing
but the liberty of the city, and the stability of the republic, without
injury to any, advised him to make new Squittini, by which means the
election purses might be filled with the names of those favorable to his
design. Niccolo took his brother's advice, and thus wasted the period
of his magistracy in vain hopes, which his friends, the leading
conspirators, allowed him to do from motives of envy; for they were
unwilling that the government should be reformed by the authority
of Niccolo, and thought they would be in time enough to effect their
purpose under another gonfalonier. Thus the magistracy of Niccolo
expired; and having commenced many things without completing aught, he
retired from office with much less credit than when he had entered upon
it.

This circumstance caused the aggrandizement of Piero's party, whose
friends entertained stronger hopes, while those who had been neutral or
wavering became his adherents; so that both sides being balanced,
many months elapsed without any open demonstration of their particular
designs. Piero's party continuing to gather strength, his enemies'
indignation increased in proportion; and they now determined to effect
by force what they either could not accomplish, or were unwilling to
attempt by the medium of the magistrates, which was assassination of
Piero, who lay sick at Careggi, and to this end order the marquis of
Ferrara nearer to the city with his forces, that after Piero's death he
might lead them into the piazza, and thus compel the Signory to form a
government according to their own wishes; for though all might not be
friendly, they trusted they would be able to induce those to submit by
fear who might be opposed to them from principle.

Diotisalvi, the better to conceal his design, frequently visited Piero,
conversed with him respecting the union of the city, and advised him to
effect it. The conspirators' designs had already been fully disclosed to
Piero; besides this, Domenico Martelli had informed him, that Francesco
Neroni, the brother of Diotisalvi, had endeavored to induce him to join
them, assuring him the victory was certain, and their object all but
attained. Upon this, Piero resolved to take advantage of his enemies'
tampering with the marquis of Ferrara, and be first in arms. He
therefore intimated that he had received a letter from Giovanni
Bentivogli, prince of Bologna, which informed him that the marquis of
Ferrara was upon the river Albo, at the head of a considerable force,
with the avowed intention of leading it to Florence; that upon this
advice he had taken up arms; after which, in the midst of a strong
force, he came to the city, when all who were disposed to support him,
armed themselves also. The adverse party did the same, but not in such
good order, being unprepared. The residence of Diotisalvi being near
that of Piero, he did not think himself safe in it, but first went to
the palace and begged the Signory would endeavor to induce Piero to lay
down his arms, and thence to Luca Pitti, to keep him faithful in their
cause. Niccolo Soderini displayed the most activity; for taking arms,
and being followed by nearly all the plebeians in his vicinity, he
proceeded to the house of Luca, and begged that he would mount his
horse, and come to the piazza in support of the Signory, who were, he
said, favorable, and that the victory would, undoubtedly, be on their
side; that he should not stay in the house to be basely slain by their
armed enemies, or ignominiously deceived by those who were unarmed; for,
in that case, he would soon repent of having neglected an opportunity
irrecoverably lost; that if he desired the forcible ruin of Piero, he
might easily effect it; and that if he were anxious for peace, it would
be far better to be in a condition to propose terms than to be compelled
to accept any that might be offered. These words produced no effect upon
Luca, whose mind was now quite made up; he had been induced to desert
his party by new conditions and promises of alliance from Piero; for one
of his nieces had been married to Giovanni Tornabuoni. He, therefore,
advised Niccolo to dismiss his followers and return home, telling him
he ought to be satisfied, if the city were governed by the magistrates,
which would certainly be the case, and that all ought to lay aside their
weapons; for the Signory, most of whom were friendly, would decide their
differences. Niccolo, finding him impracticable, returned home; but
before he left, he said, "I can do the city no good alone, but I can
easily foresee the evils that will befall her. This resolution of yours
will rob our country of her liberty; you will lose the government, I
shall lose my property, and the rest will be exiled."

During this disturbance the Signory closed the palace and kept their
magistrates about them, without showing favor to either party. The
citizens, especially those who had followed Luca Pitti, finding Piero
fully prepared and his adversaries unarmed, began to consider, not how
they might injure him, but how, with least observation, glide into
the ranks of his friends. The principal citizens, the leaders of both
factions, assembled in the palace in the presence of the Signory,
and spoke respecting the state of the city and the reconciliation
of parties; and as the infirmities of Piero prevented him from being
present, they, with one exception, unanimously determined to wait upon
him at his house. Niccolo Soderini having first placed his children
and his effects under the care of his brother Tommaso, withdrew to his
villa, there to await the event, but apprehended misfortune to himself
and ruin to his country. The other citizens coming into Piero's
presence, one of them who had been appointed spokesman, complained of
the disturbances that had arisen in the city, and endeavored to show,
that those must be most to blame who had been first to take up arms; and
not knowing what Piero (who was evidently the first to do so) intended,
they had come in order to be informed of his design, and if it had in
view the welfare of the city, they were desirous of supporting it. Piero
replied, that not those who first take arms are the most to blame, but
those who give the first occasion for it, and if they would reflect a
little on their mode of proceeding toward himself, they would cease to
wonder at what he had done; for they could not fail to perceive, that
nocturnal assemblies, the enrollment of partisans, and attempts to
deprive him both of his authority and his life, had caused him to take
arms; and they might further observe, that as his forces had not quitted
his own house, his design was evidently only to defend himself and not
to injure others. He neither sought nor desired anything but safety and
repose; neither had his conduct ever manifested a desire for ought else;
for when the authority of the Balia expired, he never made any attempt
to renew it, and was very glad the magistrates had governed the city and
had been content. They might also remember that Cosmo and his sons could
live respected in Florence, either with the Balia or without it, and
that in 1458, it was not his family, but themselves, who had renewed it.
That if they did not wish for it at present, neither did he; but this
did not satisfy them; for he perceived that they thought it impossible
to remain in Florence while he was there. It was entirely beyond all
his anticipations that his own or his father's friends should think
themselves unsafe with him in Florence, having always shown himself
quiet and peaceable. He then addressed himself to Diotisalvi and his
brothers, who were present, reminding them with grave indignation, of
the benefits they had received from Cosmo, the confidence he had reposed
in them and their subsequent ingratitude; and his words so strongly
excited some present, that had he not interfered, they would certainly
have torn the Neroni to pieces on the spot. He concluded by saying, that
he should approve of any determination of themselves and the Signory;
and that for his own part, he only desired peace and safety. After this,
many things were discussed, but nothing determined, excepting generally,
that it was necessary to reform the administration of the city and
government.

The Gonfalon of Justice was then in the hands of Bernardo Lotti, a man
not in the confidence of Piero, who was therefore disinclined to attempt
aught while he was in office; but no inconvenience would result from the
delay, as his magistracy was on the point of expiring. Upon the election
of Signors for the months of September and October, 1466, Roberto Lioni
was appointed to the supreme magistracy, and as soon as he assumed its
duties, every requisite arrangement having been previously made, the
people were called to the piazza, and a new Balia created, wholly in
favor of Piero, who soon afterward filled all the offices of government
according to his own pleasure. These transactions alarmed the leaders of
the opposite faction, and Agnolo Acciajuoli fled to Naples, Diotisalvi
Neroni and Niccolo Soderini to Venice. Luca Pitti remained in Florence,
trusting to his new relationship and the promises of Piero. The refugees
were declared rebels, and all the family of the Neroni were dispersed.
Giovanni di Neroni, then archbishop of Florence, to avoid a greater
evil, became a voluntary exile at Rome, and to many other citizens
who fled, various places of banishment were appointed. Nor was this
considered sufficient; for it was ordered that the citizens should go
in solemn procession to thank God for the preservation of the government
and the reunion of the city, during the performance of which, some were
taken and tortured, and part of them afterward put to death and exiled.
In this great vicissitude of affairs, there was not a more remarkable
instance of the uncertainty of fortune than Luca Pitti, who soon found
the difference between victory and defeat, honor and disgrace. His house
now presented only a vast solitude, where previously crowds of citizens
had assembled. In the streets, his friends and relatives, instead of
accompanying, were afraid even to salute him. Some of them were deprived
of the honors of government, others of their property, and all alike
threatened. The superb edifices he had commenced were abandoned by
the builders; the benefits that had been conferred upon him, where now
exchanged for injuries, the honors for disgrace. Hence many of those who
had presented him with articles of value now demanded them back again,
as being only lent; and those who had been in the habit of extolling
him as a man of surpassing excellence, now termed him violent and
ungrateful. So that, when too late, he regretted not having taken the
advice of Niccolo Soderini, and preferred an honorable death in battle,
than to a life of ignominy among his victorious enemies.

The exiles now began to consider various means of recovering that
citizenship which they had not been able to preserve. However, Agnolo
Acciajuoli being at Naples, before he attempted anything else, resolved
to sound Piero, and try if he could effect a reconciliation. For this
purpose, he wrote to him in the following terms: "I cannot help laughing
at the freaks of fortune, perceiving how, at her pleasure, she converts
friends into enemies, and enemies into friends. You may remember that
during your father's exile, regarding more the injury done to him than
my own misfortunes, I was banished, and in danger of death, and never
during Cosmo's life failed to honor and support your family; neither
have I since his death ever entertained a wish to injure you. True,
it is, that your own sickness, and the tender years of your sons,
so alarmed me, that I judged it desirable to give such a form to the
government, that after your death our country might not be ruined; and
hence, the proceedings, which not against you, but for the safety of
the state, have been adopted, which, if mistaken, will surely obtain
forgiveness, both for the good design in view, and on account of my
former services. Neither can I apprehend, that your house, having found
me so long faithful, should now prove unmerciful, or that you could
cancel the impression of so much merit for so small a fault." Piero
replied: "Your laughing in your present abode is the cause why I do
not weep, for were you to laugh in Florence, I should have to weep at
Naples. I confess you were well disposed toward my father, and you ought
to confess you were well paid for it; and the obligation is so much the
greater on your part than on ours, as deeds are of greater value than
words. Having been recompensed for your good wishes, it ought not to
surprise you that you now receive the due reward of your bad ones.
Neither will a pretense of your patriotism excuse you, for none will
think the city less beloved or benefited by the Medici, than by the
Acciajuoli. It, therefore, seems but just, that you should remain in
dishonor at Naples, since you knew not how to live with honor at home."

Agnolo, hopeless of obtaining pardon, went to Rome, where, joining the
archbishop and other refugees, they used every available means to injure
the commercial credit of the Medici in that city. Their attempts greatly
annoyed Piero; but by his friends' assistance, he was enabled to render
them abortive. Diotisalvi Neroni and Niccolo Soderini strenuously urged
the Venetian senate to make war upon their country, calculating, that
in case of an attack, the government being new and unpopular, would
be unable to resist. At this time there resided at Ferrara, Giovanni
Francesco, son of Palla Strozzi, who, with his father, was banished from
Florence in the changes of 1434. He possessed great influence, and was
considered one of the richest merchants. The newly banished pointed out
to Giovanni Francesco how easily they might return to their country,
if the Venetians were to undertake the enterprise, and that it was most
probable they would do so, if they had pecuniary assistance, but that
otherwise it would be doubtful. Giovanni Francesco, wishing to avenge
his own injuries, at once fell in with their ideas, and promised to
contribute to the success of the attempt all the means in his power.
On this they went to the Doge, and complained of the exile they were
compelled to endure, for no other reason, they said, than for having
wished their country should be subject to equal laws, and that the
magistrates should govern, not a few private individuals; that Piero de'
Medici, with his adherents, who were accustomed to act tyrannically, had
secretly taken up arms, deceitfully induced them to lay their own aside,
and thus, by fraud, expelled them from their country; that, not content
with this, they made the Almighty himself a means of oppression to
several, who, trusting to their promises, had remained in the city
and were there betrayed; for, during public worship and solemn
supplications, that the Deity might seem to participate in their
treachery, many citizens had been seized, imprisoned, tortured, and put
to death; thus affording to the world a horrible and impious precedent.
To avenge themselves for these injuries, they knew not where to turn
with so much hope of success as to the senate, which, having always
enjoyed their liberty, ought to compassionate those who had lost it.
They therefore called upon them as free men to assist them against
tyrants; as pious, against the wicked; and would remind the Venetians,
that it was the family of the Medici who had robbed them of their
dominions in Lombardy, contrary to the wish of the other citizens,
and who, in opposition to the interests of the senate, had favored and
supported Francesco, so, that if the exiles' distresses could not induce
them to undertake the war, the just indignation of the people of Venice,
and their desire of vengeance ought to prevail.



CHAPTER IV

War between the Venetians and the Florentines--Peace
re-established--Death of Niccolo Soderini--His character--Excesses in
Florence--Various external events from 1468 to 1471--Accession of Sixtus
IV.--His character--Grief of Piero de' Medici for the violence committed

Medici for the restoration of order--His death and character--Tommaso
Soderini, a citizen of great reputation, declares himself in favor of
the Medici--Disturbances at Prato occasioned by Bernardo Nardi.

The concluding words of the Florentine exiles produced the utmost
excitement among the Venetian senators, and they resolved to send
Bernardo Coglione, their general, to attack the Florentine territory.
The troops were assembled, and joined by Ercole da Esti, who had been
sent by Borgo, marquis of Ferrara. At the commencement of hostilities,
the Florentines not being prepared, their enemies burned the Borgo of
Dovadola, and plundered the surrounding country. But having expelled the
enemies of Piero, renewed their league with Galeazzo, duke of Milan, and
Ferrando, king of Naples, they appointed to the command of their forces
Federigo, count of Urbino; and being thus on good terms with their
friends, their enemies occasioned them less anxiety. Ferrando sent
Alfonso, his eldest son, to their aid, and Galeazzo came in person,
each at the head of a suitable force, and all assembled at Castrocaro,
a fortress belonging to the Florentines, and situated among the roots of
the Appennines which descend from Tuscany to Romagna. In the meantime,
the enemy withdrew toward Imola. A few slight skirmishes took place
between the armies; yet, in accordance with the custom of the times,
neither of them acted on the offensive, besieged any town, or gave the
other an opportunity of coming to a general engagement; but each kept
within their tents, and conducted themselves with most remarkable
cowardice. This occasioned general dissatisfaction among the
Florentines; for they found themselves involved in an expensive war,
from which no advantage could be derived. The magistrates complained
of these spiritless proceedings to those who had been appointed
commissaries to the expedition; but they replied, that the entire evil
was chargeable upon the Duke Galeazzo, who possessing great authority
and little experience, was unable to suggest useful measures, and
unwilling to take the advice of those who were more capable; and
therefore any demonstration of courage or energy would be impracticable
so long as he remained with the army. Hereupon the Florentines
intimated to the duke, that his presence with the force was in many
ways advantageous and beneficial, and of itself sufficient to alarm the
enemy; but they considered his own safety and that of his dominions,
much more important than their own immediate convenience; because so
long as the former were safe, the Florentines had nothing to fear, and
all would go well; but if his dominions were to suffer, they might then
apprehend all kinds of misfortune. They assured him they did not think
it prudent for him to be absent so long from Milan, having recently
succeeded to the government, and being surrounded by many powerful
enemies and suspected neighbors; while any who were desirous of plotting
against him, had an opportunity of doing so with impunity. They would,
therefore, advise him to return to his territories, leaving part of
his troops with them for the use of the expedition. This advice pleased
Galeazzo, who, in consequence, immediately withdrew to Milan. The
Florentine generals being now left without any hindrance, to show that
the cause assigned for their inaction was the true one, pressed the
enemy more closely, so that they came to a regular engagement, which
continued half a day, without either party yielding. Some horses were
wounded and prisoners taken, but no death occurred. Winter having
arrived, and with it the usual time for armies to retire into quarters,
Bartolommeo Coglione withdrew to Ravenna, the Florentine forces into
Tuscany, and those of the king and duke, each to the territories of
their sovereign. As this attempt had not occasioned any tumult in
Florence, contrary to the rebels' expectation, and the troops they had
hired were in want of pay, terms of peace were proposed, and easily
arranged. The revolted Florentines, thus deprived of hope, dispersed
themselves in various places. Diotisalvi Neroni withdrew to Ferrara,
where he was received and entertained by the Marquis Borso. Niccolo
Soderini went to Ravenna, where, upon a small pension allowed by the
Venetians, he grew old and died. He was considered a just and brave man,
but over-cautious and slow to determine, a circumstance which occasioned
him, when Gonfalonier of Justice, to lose the opportunity of victory
which he would have gladly recovered when too late.

Upon the restoration of peace, those who remained victorious in
Florence, as if unable to convince themselves they had conquered, unless
they oppressed not merely their enemies, but all whom they suspected,
prevailed upon Bardo Altoviti, then Gonfalonier of Justice, to deprive
many of the honors of government, and to banish several more. They
exercised their power so inconsiderately, and conducted themselves in
such an arbitrary manner, that it seemed as if fortune and the Almighty
had given the city up to them for a prey. Piero knew little of these
things, and was unable to remedy even the little he knew, on account
of his infirmities; his body being so contracted that he could use no
faculty but that of speech. All he could do was to admonish the leading
men, and beg they would conduct themselves with greater moderation, and
not by their violence effect their country's ruin. In order to divert
the city, he resolved to celebrate the marriage of his son Lorenzo
with Clarice degli Orsini with great splendor; and it was accordingly
solemnized with all the display suitable to the exalted rank of the
parties. Feasts, dancing, and antique representations occupied many
days; at the conclusion of which, to exhibit the grandeur of the house
of Medici and of the government, two military spectacles were presented,
one performed by men on horseback, who went through the evolutions of
a field engagement, and the other representing the storming of a
town; everything being conducted with admirable order and the greatest
imaginable brilliancy.

During these transactions in Florence, the rest of Italy, though at
peace, was filled with apprehension of the power of the Turks, who
continued to attack the Christians, and had taken Negropont, to the
great disgrace and injury of the Christian name. About this time died
Borso, marquis of Ferrara, who was succeeded by his brother Ercole.
Gismondo da Rimini, the inveterate enemy of the church also expired, and
his natural brother Roberto, who was afterward one of the best generals
of Italy, succeeded him. Pope Paul died, and was succeeded by Sixtus IV.
previously called Francesco da Savona, a man of the very lowest origin,
who by his talents had become general of the order of St. Francis, and
afterward cardinal. He was the first who began to show how far a pope
might go, and how much that which was previously regarded as sinful lost
its iniquity when committed by a pontiff. Among others of his family
were Piero and Girolamo, who, according to universal belief, were his
sons, though he designated them by terms reflecting less scandal on
his character. Piero being a priest, was advanced to the dignity of a
cardinal, with the title of St. Sixtus. To Girolamo he gave the city
of Furli, taken from Antonio Ordelaffi, whose ancestors had held that
territory for many generations. This ambitious method of procedure made
him more regarded by the princes of Italy, and all sought to obtain
his friendship. The duke of Milan gave his natural daughter Caterina to
Girolamo, with the city of Imola, which he had taken from Taddeo degli
Alidossi, as her portion. New matrimonial alliances were formed between
the duke and king Ferrando; Elisabetta, daughter of Alfonso, the king's
eldest son, being united to Giovan Galeazzo, the eldest son of the duke.

Italy being at peace, the principal employment of her princes was to
watch each other, and strengthen their own influence by new alliances,
leagues, or friendships. But in the midst of this repose, Florence
endured great oppression from her principal citizens, and the
infirmities of Piero incapacitated him from restraining their ambition.
However, to relieve his conscience, and, if possible, to make them
ashamed of their conduct, he sent for them to his house, and addressed
them in the following words: "I never thought a time would come when the
behavior of my friends would compel me to esteem and desire the society
of my enemies, and wish that I had been defeated rather than victorious;
for I believed myself to be associated with those who would set some
bounds to their avarice, and who, after having avenged themselves on
their enemies, and lived in their country with security and honor, would
be satisfied. But now I find myself greatly deceived, unacquainted with
the ambition of mankind, and least of all with yours; for, not satisfied
with being masters of so great a city, and possessing among yourselves
those honors, dignities, and emoluments which used to be divided among
many citizens; not contented with having shared among a few the property
of your enemies, or with being able to oppress all others with public
burdens, while you yourselves are exempt from them, and enjoy all the
public offices of profit you must still further load everyone with ill
usage. You plunder your neighbors of their wealth; you sell justice;
you evade the law; you oppress the timid and exalt the insolent. Nor
is there, throughout all Italy, so many and such shocking examples of
violence and avarice as in this city. Has our country fostered us only
to be her destroyer? Have we been victorious only to effect her ruin?
Has she honored us that we may overwhelm her with disgrace? Now, by that
faith which is binding upon all good men, I promise you, that if you
still conduct yourselves so as to make me regret my victory, I will
adopt such measures as shall cause you bitterly to repent of having
misused it." The reply of the citizens accorded with the time and
circumstances, but they did not forego their evil practices; so that,
in consequence, Piero sent for Agnolo Acciajuoli to come secretly to
Cafaggiolo, and discussed with him at great length the condition of the
city; and doubtless, had he not been prevented by death, he would have
called home the exiles as a check upon the rapine of the opposite party.
But these honorable designs were frustrated; for, sinking under bodily
infirmities and mental anguish, he expired in the fifty-third year
of his age. His goodness and virtue were not duly appreciated by his
country, principally from his having, until almost the close of his
life, been associated with Cosmo, and the few years he survived being
spent in civil discord and constant debility. Piero was buried in the
church of St. Lorenzo, near his father, and his obsequies were performed
with all the pomp and solemnity due to his exalted station. He left two
sons, Lorenzo and Guiliano, whose extreme youth excited alarm in the
minds of thinking men, though each gave hopes of future usefulness to
the republic.

Among the principal citizens in the government of Florence, and very
superior to the rest, was Tommaso Soderini, whose prudence and authority
were well known not only at home, but throughout Italy. After Piero's
death, the whole city looked up to him; many citizens waited upon him
at his own house, as the head of the government, and several princes
addressed him by letter; but he, impartially estimating his own
fortune and that of the house of Medici, made no reply to the princes'
communications, and told the citizens, it was not his house, but that
of the Medici they ought to visit. To demonstrate by his actions the
sincerity and integrity of his advice he assembled all the heads of
noble families in the convent of St. Antonio, whither he also brought
Lorenzo and Guiliano de' Medici, and in a long and serious speech upon
the state of the city, the condition of Italy, and the views of her
princes, he assured them, that if they wished to live in peace and unity
in Florence, free both from internal dissensions and foreign wars,
it would be necessary to respect the sons of Piero and support the
reputation of their house; for men never regret their continuance in a
course sanctioned by custom while new methods are soon adopted and as
speedily set aside; and it has always been found easier to maintain a
power which by its continuance has outlived envy, than to raise a new
one, which innumerable unforeseen causes may overthrow. When Tommaso
had concluded, Lorenzo spoke, and, though young, with such modesty and
discretion that all present felt a presentiment of his becoming what he
afterward proved to be; and before the citizens departed they swore to
regard the youths as their sons, and the brothers promised to look upon
them as their parents. After this, Lorenzo and Guiliano were honored as
princes, and resolved to be guided by the advice of Tommaso Soderini.

While profound tranquillity prevailed both at home and abroad, no wars
disturbing the general repose, there arose an unexpected disturbance,
which came like a presage of future evils. Among the ruined families of
the party of Luca Pitti, was that of the Nardi; for Salvestro and his
brothers, the heads of the house, were banished and afterward declared
rebels for having taken part in the war under Bartolommeo Coglione.
Bernardo, the brother of Salvestro, was young, prompt, and bold, and on
account of his poverty being unable to alleviate the sorrows of exile,
while the peace extinguished all hopes of his return to the city, he
determined to attempt some means of rekindling the war; for a trifling
commencement often produces great results, and men more readily
prosecute what is already begun than originate new enterprises. Bernardo
had many acquaintances at Prato, and still more in the district of
Pistoia, particularly among the Palandra, a family which, though rustic,
was very numerous, and, like the rest of the Pistolesi, brought up to
slaughter and war. These he knew to be discontented, on account of the
Florentine magistrates having endeavored, perhaps too severely, to check
their partiality for inveterate feuds and consequence bloodshed. He was
also aware that the people of Prato considered themselves injured by the
pride and avarice of their governors, and that some were ill disposed
toward Florence; therefore all things considered, he hoped to be able to
kindle a fire in Tuscany (should Prato rebel) which would be fostered
by so many, that those who might wish to extinguish it would fail in the
attempt. He communicated his ideas to Diotisalvi Neroni, and asked
him, in case they should succeed in taking possession of Prato, what
assistance might be expected from the princes of Italy, by his means?
Diotisalvi considered the enterprise as imminently dangerous, and almost
impracticable; but since it presented a fresh chance of attaining his
object, at the risk of others, he advised him to proceed, and promised
certain assistance from Bologna and Ferrara, if he could retain Prato
not less than fifteen days. Bernardo, whom this promise inspired with
a lively hope of success, proceeded secretly to Prato, and communicated
with those most disposed to favor him, among whom were the Palandra; and
having arranged the time and plan, informed Diotisalvi of what had been
done.



CHAPTER V

Bernardo takes possession of Prato, but is not assisted by the
inhabitants--He is taken, and the tumult appeased--Corruption of
Florence--The duke of Milan in Florence--The church of Santo Spirito
destroyed by fire--The rebellion of Volterra, and the cause of
it--Volterra reduced to obedience by force, in accordance with the
advice of Lorenzo de' Medici--Volterra pillaged.

Cesare Petrucci held the office of Provost of Prato for the Florentine
people, at this period. It is customary with governors of towns,
similarly situated, to keep the keys of the gates near their persons;
and whenever, in peaceful times, they are required by any of the
inhabitants, for entrance or exit, they are usually allowed to be taken.
Bernardo was aware of this custom, and about daybreak, presented himself
at the gate which looks toward Pistoia, accompanied by the Palandra and
about one hundred persons, all armed. Their confederates within the town
also armed themselves, and one of them asked the governor for the keys,
alleging, as a pretext, that some one from the country wished to enter.
The governor not entertaining the slightest suspicion, sent a servant
with them. When at a convenient distance, they were taken by the
conspirators, who, opening the gates, introduced Bernardo and his
followers. They divided themselves into two parties, one of which, led
by Salvestro, an inhabitant of Prato, took possession of the citadel;
the other following Bernardo, seized the palace, and placed Cesare with
all his family in the custody of some of their number. They then raised
the cry of liberty, and proceeded through the town. It was now day,
and many of the inhabitants hearing the disturbance, ran to the piazza
where, learning that the fortress and the palace were taken and
the governor with all his people made prisoners, they were utterly
astonished, and could not imagine how it had occurred. The eight
citizens, possessing the supreme authority, assembled in their palace
to consider what was best to be done. In the meantime, Bernardo and his
followers, on going round the town, found no encouragement, and being
told that the Eight had assembled, went and declared the nature of
their enterprise, which he said was to deliver the country from slavery,
reminding them how glorious it would be for those who took arms to
effect such an honorable object, for they would thus obtain permanent
repose and everlasting fame. He called to recollection their ancient
liberty and present condition, and assured them of certain assistance,
if they would only, for a few days, aid in resisting the forces the
Florentines might send against them. He said he had friends in Florence
who would join them as soon as they found the inhabitants resolved to
support him. His speech did not produce the desired effect upon the
Eight, who replied that they knew not whether Florence was free or
enslaved, for that was a matter which they were not called upon to
decide; but this they knew very well, that for their own part, they
desired no other liberty than to obey the magistrates who governed
Florence, from whom they had never received any injury sufficient
to make them desire a change. They therefore advised him to set the
governor at liberty, clear the place of his people, and, as quickly as
possible, withdraw from the danger he had so rashly incurred. Bernardo
was not daunted by these words, but determined to try whether fear
could influence the people of Prato, since entreaties produced so little
effect. In order to terrify them, he determined to put Cesare to death,
and having brought him out of prison, ordered him to be hanged at the
windows of the palace. He was already led to the spot with a halter
around his neck, when seeing Bernardo giving directions to hasten
his end, he turned to him, and said: "Bernardo, you put me to death,
thinking that the people of Prato will follow you; but the direct
contrary will result; for the respect they have for the rectors which
the Florentine people send here is so great, that as soon as they
witness the injury inflicted upon me, they will conceive such a disgust
against you as will inevitably effect your ruin. Therefore, it is not
by my death, but by the preservation of my life, that you can attain the
object you have in view; for if I deliver your commands, they will be
much more readily obeyed, and following your directions, we shall soon
attain the completion of your design." Bernardo, whose mind was not
fertile in expedients, thought the advice good, and commanded Cesare, on
being conducted to a veranda which looked upon the piazza, to order the
people of Prato to obey him, and having done which, Cesare was led back
to prison.

The weakness of the conspirators was obvious; and many Florentines
residing in the town, assembled together, among whom, Giorgio Ginori, a
knight of Rhodes, took arms first against them, and attacked Bernardo,
who traversed the piazza, alternately entreating and threatening those
who refused to obey him, and being surrounded by Giorgio's followers, he
was wounded and made prisoner. This being done, it was easy to set the
governor at liberty and subdue the rest, who being few, and divided into
several parties, were nearly all either secured or slain. An exaggerated
report of these transactions reached Florence, it being told there that
Prato was taken, the governor and his friends put to death, and the
place filled with the enemy; and that Pistoia was also in arms, and
most of the citizens in the conspiracy. In consequence of this alarming
account, the palace as quickly filled with citizens, who consulted with
the Signory what course ought to be adopted. At this time, Roberto da
San Severino, one of the most distinguished generals of this period,
was at Florence, and it was therefore determined to send him, with what
forces could be collected, to Prato, with orders that he should approach
the place, particularly observe what was going on, and provide such
remedies as the necessity of the case and his own prudence should
suggest. Roberto had scarcely passed the fortress of Campi, when he was
met by a messenger from the governor, who informed him that Bernardo was
taken, his followers either dispersed or slain, and everything restored
to order. He consequently returned to Florence, whither Bernardo was
shortly after conveyed, and when questioned by the magistracy concerning
the real motives of such a weak conspiracy, he said, he had undertaken
it, because, having resolved to die in Florence rather than live in
exile, he wished his death to be accompanied by some memorable action.

This disturbance having been raised and quelled almost at the same time,
the citizens returned to their accustomed mode of life, hoping to enjoy,
without anxiety, the state they had now established and confirmed. Hence
arose many of those evils which usually result from peace; for the youth
having become more dissolute than before, more extravagant in dress,
feasting, and other licentiousness, and being without employment, wasted
their time and means on gaming and women; their principal study being
how to appear splendid in apparel, and attain a crafty shrewdness in
discourse; he who could make the most poignant remark being considered
the wisest, and being most respected. These manners derived additional
encouragement from the followers of the duke of Milan, who, with his
duchess and the whole ducal court, as it was said, to fulfill a vow,
came to Florence, where he was received with all the pomp and respect
due to so great a prince, and one so intimately connected with
the Florentine people. Upon this occasion the city witnessed an
unprecedented exhibition; for, during Lent, when the church commands us
to abstain from animal food, the Milanese, without respect for either
God or his church, ate of it daily. Many spectacles were exhibited in
honor of the duke, and among others, in the temple of Santo Spirito,
was represented the descent of the Holy Ghost among the apostles; and
in consequence of the numerous fires used upon the occasion, some of the
woodwork became ignited, and the church was completely destroyed by the
flames. Many thought that the Almighty being offended at our misconduct,
took this method of signifying his displeasure. If, therefore, the duke
found the city full of courtly delicacies, and customs unsuitable to
well-regulated conduct, he left it in a much worse state. Hence the good
citizens thought it necessary to restrain these improprieties, and made
a law to put a stop to extravagance in dress, feasts, and funerals.

In the midst of this universal peace, a new and unexpected disturbance
arose in Tuscany. Certain citizens of Volterra had discovered an
alum-mine in their district, and being aware of the profit derivable
from it, in order to obtain the means of working and securing it, they
applied to some Florentines, and allowed them to share in the profits.
This, as is frequently the case with new undertakings, at first excited
little attention from the people of Volterra; but in time, finding
the profits derived from it had become considerable, they fruitlessly
endeavored to effect what at first might have been easily accomplished.
They began by agitating the question in their councils, declaring it
grossly improper that a source of wealth discovered in the public lands
should be converted to the emolument of private individuals. They
next sent advocates to Florence, and the question was referred to the
consideration of certain citizens, who, either through being bribed by
the party in possession, or from a sincere conviction, declared the
aim of the people of Volterra to be unjust in desiring to deprive their
citizens of the fruit of their labor; and decided that the alum-pit was
the rightful property of those who had hitherto wrought it; but, at
the same time, recommended them to pay an annual sum by way of
acknowledgment to the city. This answer instead of abating, served only
to increase the animosities and tumult in Volterra, and absorbed entire
attention both in the councils and throughout the city; the people
demanding the restitution of what they considered their due, and
the proprietors insisting upon their right to retain what they had
originally acquired, and what had been subsequently been confirmed
to them by the decision of the Florentines. In the midst of these
disturbances, a respectable citizen, named Il Pecorino, was killed,
together with several others, who had embraced the same side, whose
houses were also plundered and burned; and the fury of the mob rose to
such a height, that they were with difficulty restrained from putting
the Florentine rectors to death.

After the first outrage, the Volterrani immediately determined to send
ambassadors to Florence, who intimated, that if the Signory would allow
them their ancient privileges, the city would remain subject to them as
formerly. Many and various were the opinions concerning the reply to be
made. Tommaso Soderini advised that they should accept the submission
of the people of Volterra, upon any conditions with which they were
disposed to make it; for he considered it unreasonable and unwise to
kindle a flame so near home that it might burn their own dwelling; he
suspected the pope's ambition, and was apprehensive of the power of the
king; nor could he confide in the friendship either of the duke or the
Venetians, having no assurance of the sincerity of the latter, or the
valor of the former. He concluded by quoting that trite proverb, "Meglio
un magro accordo che una grassa vittoria."[*] On the other hand, Lorenzo
de' Medici, thinking this an opportunity for exhibiting his prudence
and wisdom, and being strenuously supported by those who envied the
influence of Tommaso Soderini, resolved to march against them, and
punish the arrogance of the people of Volterra with arms; declaring
that if they were not made a striking example, others would, without
the least fear or respect, upon every slight occasion, adopt a similar
course. The enterprise being resolved on, the Volterrani were told that
they could not demand the observance of conditions which they themselves
had broken, and therefore must either submit to the direction of the
Signory or expect war. With this answer they returned to their city, and
prepared for its defense; fortifying the place, and sending to all the
princes of Italy to request assistance, none of whom listened to them,
except the Siennese and the lord of Piombino, who gave them some hope
of aid. The Florentines on the other hand, thinking success dependent
principally upon celerity, assembled ten thousand foot and two thousand
horse, who, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino, marched into
the country of Volterra and quickly took entire possession of it. They
then encamped before the city, which, being in a lofty situation, and
precipitous on all sides, could only be approached by a narrow pass
near the church of St. Alessandro. The Volterrani had engaged for
their defense about one thousand mercenaries, who, perceiving the great
superiority of the Florentines, found the place untenable, and were
tardy in their defensive operations, but indefatigable in the constant
injuries they committed upon the people of the place. Thus these poor
citizens were harassed by the enemy without, and by their own soldiery
within; so, despairing of their safety, they began to think of a
capitulation; and, being unable to obtain better terms, submitted to the
discretion of the Florentine commissaries, who ordered the gates to
be opened, and introduced the greater part of their forces. They then
proceeded to the palace, and commanded the priors to retire to their
homes; and, on the way thither, one of them was in derision stripped
by the soldiers. From this beginning (so much more easily are men
predisposed to evil than to good) originated the pillage and destruction
of the city; which for a whole day suffered the greatest horrors,
neither women nor sacred places being spared; and the soldiery, those
engaged for its defense as well as its assailants, plundered all that
came within their reach. The news of this victory was received with
great joy at Florence, and as the expedition had been undertaken wholly
by the advice of Lorenzo, he acquired great reputation. Upon which one
of the intimate friends of Tommaso Soderini, reminding him of the advice
he had given, asked him what he thought of the taking of Volterra; to
which he replied, "To me the place seems rather lost than won; for had
it been received on equitable terms, advantage and security would have
been the result; but having to retain it by force it will in critical
junctures, occasion weakness and anxiety, and in times of peace, injury
and expense."

     [*] A lean peace is better than a fat victory.



CHAPTER VI

Origin of the animosity between Sixtus IV. and Lorenzo de' Medici--Carlo
di Braccio da Perugia attacks the Siennese--Carlo retires by desire
of the Florentines--Conspiracy against Galeazzo, duke of Milan--His
vices--He is slain by the conspirators--Their deaths.

The pope, anxious to retain the territories of the church in obedience,
had caused Spoleto to be sacked for having, through internal factions,
fallen into rebellion. Citta di Castello being in the same state of
contumacy, he besieged that place; and Niccolo Vitelli its prince, being
on intimate terms with Lorenzo de' Medici, obtained assistance from
him, which, though inadequate, was quite enough to originate that enmity
between Sixtus IV. and the Medici afterward productive of such unhappy
results. Nor would this have been so long in development had not the
death of Frate Piero, cardinal of St. Sixtus, taken place; who, after
having traveled over Italy and visited Venice and Milan (under the
pretense of doing honor to the marriage of Ercole, marquis of Ferrara),
went about sounding the minds of the princes, to learn how they were
disposed toward the Florentines. But upon his return he died, not
without suspicion of having been poisoned by the Venetians, who found
they would have reason to fear Sixtus if he were allowed to avail
himself of the talents and exertions of Frate Piero. Although of very
low extraction, and meanly brought up within the walls of a convent,
he had no sooner attained the distinction of the scarlet hat, than
he exhibited such inordinate pride and ambition, that the pontificate
seemed too little for him, and he gave a feast in Rome which would
have seemed extraordinary even for a king, the expense exceeding twenty
thousand florins. Deprived of this minister, the designs of Sixtus
proceeded with less promptitude. The Florentines, the duke, and the
Venetians having renewed their league, and allowed the pope and the king
to join them if they thought proper, the two latter also entered into
a league, reserving an opening for the others if they were desirous
to become parties to it. Italy was thus divided in two factions; for
circumstances daily arose which occasioned ill feeling between the two
leagues; as occurred with respect to the island of Cyprus, to which
Ferrando laid claim, and the Venetians occupied. Thus the pope and the
king became more closely united. Federigo, prince of Urbino, was at
this time one of the first generals of Italy; and had long served the
Florentines. In order, if possible, to deprive the hostile league of
their captain, the pope advised, and the king requested him to pay
a visit to them. To the surprise and displeasure of the Florentines,
Federigo complied; for they thought the same fate awaited him as had
befallen Niccolo Piccinino. However, the result was quite different;
for he returned from Naples and Rome greatly honored, and with the
appointment of general to their forces. They also endeavored to gain
over to their interest the lords of Romagna and the Siennese, that they
might more easily injure the Florentines, who, becoming aware of these
things, used their utmost endeavors to defend themselves against the
ambition of their enemies; and having lost Federigo d'Urbino, they
engaged Roberto da Rimino in his place, renewed the league with the
Perugini and formed one with the prince of Faenza. The pope and the king
assigned, as the reasons of their animosity against the Florentines,
that they wished to withdraw them from the Venetian alliance, and
associate them with their own league; for the pope did not think the
church could maintain her reputation, nor the Count Girolamo retain
the states of Romagna, while the Florentines and the Venetians remained
united. The Florentines conjectured their design was to set them at
enmity with the Venetians, not so much for the sake of gaining their
friendship as to be able the more easily to injure them. Two years
passed away in these jealousies and discontents before any disturbance
broke out; but the first which occurred, and that but trivial, took
place in Tuscany.

Braccio of Perugia, whom we have frequently mentioned as one of the
most distinguished warriors of Italy, left two sons, Oddo and Carlo; the
latter was of tender years; the former, as above related, was slain by
the people of Val di Lamona; but Carlo, when he came to mature age, was
by the Venetians, out of respect for the memory of his father, and the
hopes they entertained from himself, received among the condottieri of
their republic. The term of his engagement having expired, he did not
design to renew it immediately, but resolved to try if, by his own
influence and his father's reputation, he could recover possession of
Perugia. To this the Venetians willingly consented, for they usually
extended their dominion by any changes that occurred in the neighboring
states. Carlo consequently came into Tuscany, but found more
difficulties in his attempt upon Perugia than he had anticipated, on
account of its being allied with the Florentines; and desirous of doing
something worthy of memory, he made war upon the Siennese, alleging
them to be indebted to him for services performed by his father in the
affairs of that republic, and attacked them with such impetuosity as to
threaten the total overthrow of their dominion. The Siennese, ever ready
to suspect the Florentines, persuaded themselves that this outrage had
been committed with their cognizance, and made heavy complaints to the
pope and the king against them. They also sent ambassadors to Florence
to complain of the injuries they had suffered, and adroitly intimated,
that if Carlo had not been secretly supported he could not have made
war upon them with such perfect security. The Florentines denied all
participation in the proceedings of Carlo, expressed their most earnest
wish to do everything in their power to put a stop to them, and allowed
the ambassadors to use whatever terms they pleased in the name of
the Signory, to command him to desist. Carlo complained that the
Florentines, by their unwillingness to support him, had deprived
themselves of a most valuable acquisition and him of great glory; for he
could have insured them the possession of the whole territory in a
short time, from the want of courage in the people and the ineffectual
provision they had made for their defense. He then withdrew to his
engagement under the Venetians; but the Siennese, although delivered
from such imminent peril by the Florentines, were still very indignant
against them; considering themselves under no obligation to those who
had delivered them from an evil to which they had first exposed them.

While the transactions between the king and the pope were in progress,
and those in Tuscany in the manner we have related, an event of greater
importance occurred in Lombardy. Cola Montano, a learned and ambitious
man, taught the Latin language to the youth of the principal families in
Milan. Either out of hatred to the character and manners of the duke, or
from some other cause, he constantly deprecated the condition of those
who live under a bad prince; calling those glorious and happy who had
the good fortune to be born and live in a republic. He endeavored to
show that the most celebrated men had been produced in republics, and
not reared under princes; that the former cherish virtue, while the
latter destroy it; the one deriving advantage from virtuous men,
while the latter naturally fear them. The youths with whom he was most
intimate were Giovanni Andrea Lampognano, Carlo Visconti, and Girolamo
Ogliato. He frequently discussed with them the faults of their prince,
and the wretched condition of those who were subject to him; and by
constantly inculcating his principles, acquired such an ascendancy over
their minds as to induce them to bind themselves by oath to effect the
duke's destruction, as soon as they became old enough to attempt it.
Their minds being fully occupied with this design, which grew with
their years, the duke's conduct and their own private injuries served to
hasten its execution. Galeazzo was licentious and cruel, of both which
vices he had given such repeated proofs, that he became odious to all.
Not content with corrupting the wives of the nobility, he also took
pleasure in making it notorious; nor was he satisfied with murdering
individuals unless he effected their deaths by some unusual cruelty. He
was suspected of having destroyed his own mother; for, not considering
himself prince while she was present, he conducted himself in such a
manner as induced her to withdraw from his court, and, travelling toward
Cremona, which she obtained as part of her marriage portion, she was
seized with a sudden illness, and died upon the road; which made many
think her son had caused her death. The duke had dishonored both Carlo
and Girolamo in respect to their wives or other female relatives, and
had refused to concede to Giovanandrea possession of the monastery of
Miramondo, of which he had obtained a grant from the pope for a near
relative. These private injuries increased the young men's desire for
vengeance, and the deliverance of their country from so many evils;
trusting that whenever they should succeed in destroying the duke, many
of the nobility and all the people would rise in their defense. Being
resolved upon their undertaking, they were often together, which, on
account of their long intimacy, did not excite any suspicion. They
frequently discussed the subject; and in order to familiarize their
minds with the deed itself, they practiced striking each other in the
breast and in the side with the sheathed daggers intended to be used for
the purpose. On considering the most suitable time and place, the castle
seemed insecure; during the chase, uncertain and dangerous; while going
about the city for his own amusement, difficult if not impracticable;
and, at a banquet, of doubtful result. They, therefore, determined to
kill him upon the occasion of some procession or public festivity when
there would be no doubt of his presence, and where they might, under
various pretexts, assemble their friends. It was also resolved that
if one of their number were prevented from attending, on any account
whatever, the rest should put him to death in the midst of their armed
enemies.

It was now the close of the year 1476, near Christmas, and as it was
customary for the duke to go upon St. Stephen's day, in great solemnity,
to the church of that martyr, they considered this the most suitable
opportunity for the execution of their design. Upon the morning of that
day they ordered some of their most trusty friends and servants to arm,
telling them they wished to go to the assistance of Giovanandrea,
who, contrary to the wish of some of his neighbors, intended to turn a
watercourse into his estate; but that before they went they wished to
take leave of the prince. They also assembled, under various
pretenses, other friends and relatives, trusting that when the deed
was accomplished, everyone would join them in the completion of their
enterprise. It was their intention, after the duke's death, to collect
their followers together and proceed to those parts of the city where
they imagined the plebeians would be most disposed to take arms against
the duchess and the principal ministers of state, and they thought the
people, on account of the famine which then prevailed, would easily be
induced to follow them; for it was their design to give up the houses of
Cecco Simonetta, Giovanni Botti, and Francesco Lucani, all leading men
in the government, to be plundered, and by this means gain over the
populace and restore liberty to the community. With these ideas, and
with minds resolved upon their execution, Giovanandrea, together with
the rest, were early at the church, and heard mass together; after
which, Giovanandrea, turning to a statue of St. Ambrose, said, "O patron
of our city! thou knowest our intention, and the end we would attain,
by so many dangers; favor our enterprise, and prove, by protecting the
oppressed, that tyranny is offensive to thee." To the duke, on the other
hand, when intending to go to the church, many omens occurred of his
approaching death; for in the morning, having put on a cuirass, as was
his frequent custom, he immediately took it off again, either because
it inconvenienced him, or that he did not like its appearance. He
then wished to hear mass in the castle, and found that the priest who
officiated in the chapel had gone to St. Stephen's, and had taken with
him the sacred utensils. On this he desired the service to be performed
by the bishop of Como, who acquainted him with preventing circumstances.
Thus, almost compelled, he determined to go to the church; but before
his departure, caused his sons, Giovan Galeazzo and Ermes, to be brought
to him, whom he embraced and kissed several times, seeming reluctant to
part with them. He then left the castle, and, with the ambassadors
of Ferrara and Mantua on either hand, proceeded to St. Stephen's. The
conspirators, to avoid exciting suspicion, and to escape the cold, which
was very severe, had withdrawn to an apartment of the archpriest, who
was a friend of theirs, but hearing the duke's approach, they came into
the church, Giovanandrea and Girolamo placing themselves upon the
right hand of the entrance, and Carlo on the left. Those who led
the procession had already entered, and were followed by the duke,
surrounded by such a multitude as is usual on similar occasions. The
first attack was made by Lampognano and Girolamo, who, pretending to
clear the way for the prince, came close to him, and grasping their
daggers, which, being short and sharp, were concealed in the sleeves of
their vests, struck at him. Lampognano gave him two wounds, one in the
belly, the other in the throat. Girolamo struck him in the throat and
breast. Carlo Visconti, being nearer the door, and the duke having
passed, could not wound him in front: but with two strokes,
transpierced his shoulder and spine. These six wounds were inflicted
so instantaneously, that the duke had fallen before anyone was aware of
what had happened, and he expired, having only once ejaculated the
name of the Virgin, as if imploring her assistance. A great tumult
immediately ensued, several swords were drawn, and as often happens in
sudden emergencies, some fled from the church, and others ran toward the
scene of tumult, both without any definite motive or knowledge of what
had occurred. Those, however, who were nearest the duke and had seen
him slain, recognizing the murderers, pursued them. Giovanandrea,
endeavoring to make his way out of the church, proceeded among the
women, who being numerous, and according to their custom, seated upon
the ground, was prevented in his progress by their apparel, and being
overtaken, he was killed by a Moor, one of the duke's footmen. Carlo was
slain by those immediately around him. Girolamo Olgiato passed through
the crowd, and got out of the church; but seeing his companions dead,
and not knowing where else to go, he proceeded home, where his father
and brothers refused to receive him; his mother only, having compassion
on her son recommended him to a priest, an old friend of the family,
who, disguising him in his own apparel, led him to his house. Here he
remained two days, not without hope that some disturbance might arise
in Milan which would contribute to his safety. This not occurring, and
apprehensive that his hiding place would be discovered, he endeavored
to escape in disguise, but being observed, he was given over to justice,
and disclosed all the particulars of the conspiracy. Girolamo was
twenty-three years of age, and exhibited no less composure at his death
than resolution in his previous conduct, for being stripped of his
apparel, and in the hands of the executioner, who stood by with
the sword unsheathed, ready to deprive him of life, he repeated the
following words, in the Latin tongue, in which he was well versed: "Mors
acerba, fama perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facti."

The enterprise of these unfortunate young men was conducted with secrecy
and executed with resolution; and they failed for want of the support
of those whom they expected would rise in their defense. Let princes
therefore learn to live, so as to render themselves beloved and
respected by their subjects, that none may have hope of safety after
having destroyed them; and let others see how vain is the expectation
which induces them to trust so much to the multitude, as to believe,
that even when discontented, they will either embrace or ward off their
dangers. This event spread consternation all over Italy; but those
which shortly afterward occurred in Florence caused much more alarm, and
terminated a peace of twelve years' continuance, as will be shown in the
following book; which, having commenced with blood and horror, will have
a melancholy and tearful conclusion.




BOOK VIII



CHAPTER I

State of the family of the Medici at Florence--Enmity of Sixtus IV.
toward Florence--Differences between the family of the Pazzi and that
of the Medici--Beginning of the conspiracy of the Pazzi--Arrangements to
effect the design of the conspiracy--Giovanni Batista da Montesecco
is sent to Florence--The pope joins the conspiracy--The king of Naples
becomes a party to it--Names of the conspirators--The conspirators make
many ineffectual attempts to kill Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici--The
final arrangement--Order of the conspiracy.

This book, commencing between two conspiracies, the one at Milan already
narrated, the other yet to be recorded, it would seem appropriate, and
in accordance with our usual custom, were we to treat of the nature and
importance of these terrible demonstrations. This we should willingly do
had we not discussed the matter elsewhere, or could it be comprised in
few words. But requiring much consideration, and being already noticed
in another place, it will be omitted, and we shall proceed with our
narrative. The government of the Medici having subdued all its avowed
enemies in order to obtain for that family undivided authority, and
distinguish them from other citizens in their relation to the rest,
found it necessary to subdue those who secretly plotted against them.
While Medici contended with other families, their equals in authority
and reputation, those who envied their power were able to oppose them
openly without danger of being suppressed at the first demonstration of
hostility; for the magistrates being free, neither party had occasion to
fear, till one or other of them was overcome. But after the victory of
1466, the government became so entirely centred in the Medici, and
they acquired so much authority, that discontented spirits were obliged
either to suffer in silence, or, if desirous to destroy them, to attempt
it in secrecy, and by clandestine means; which plots rarely succeed and
most commonly involve the ruin of those concerned in them, while they
frequently contribute to the aggrandizement of those against whom they
are directed. Thus the prince of a city attacked by a conspiracy, if
not slain like the duke of Milan (which seldom happens), almost always
attains to a greater degree of power, and very often has his good
disposition perverted to evil. The proceedings of his enemies give him
cause for fear; fear suggests the necessity of providing for his
own safety, which involves the injury of others; and hence arise
animosities, and not unfrequently his ruin. Thus these conspiracies
quickly occasion the destruction of their contrivers, and, in time,
inevitably injure their primary object.

Italy, as we have seen above, was divided into two factions; the pope
and the king on one side; on the other, the Venetians, the duke, and the
Florentines. Although the flames of war had not yet broken out, every
day gave rise to some new occasion for rekindling them; and the pope,
in particular, in all his plans endeavored to annoy the Florentine
government. Thus Filippo de' Medici, archbishop of Pisa, being dead,
Francesco Salviati, a declared enemy of the Medici, was appointed his
successor, contrary to the wish of the Signory of Florence, who being
unwilling to give him possession, there arose between them and the pope
many fresh grounds of offense, before the matter was settled. Besides
this, he conferred, at Rome, many favors upon the family of the Pazzi,
and opposed that of the Medici, whenever an opportunity offered. The
Pazzi were at this time, both on account of nobility of birth and their
great wealth, the most brilliant in France. The head of this family was
Jacopo, whom the people, on account of his distinguished pre-eminence,
had made a knight. He had no children, except one natural daughter, but
many nephews, sons of his brothers Piero and Antonio, the first of whom
were Guglielmo, Francesco, Rinato, Giovanni, and then, Andrea, Niccolo,
and Galeotto. Cosmo de' Medici, noticing the riches and rank of this
family, had given his granddaughter, Bianca, to Guglielmo, hoping
by this marriage to unite the houses, and obviate those enmities and
dissensions so frequently occasioned by jealousy. However (so uncertain
and fallacious are our expectations), very different feelings were thus
originated; for Lorenzo's advisers pointed out to him how dangerous
it was, and how injurious to his authority, to unite in the same
individuals so much wealth and power. In consequence, neither Jacopo
nor his nephews obtained those degrees of honor, which in the opinion of
other citizens were their due. This gave rise to anger in the Pazzi, and
fear on the part of the Medici; as the former of these increased, so did
the latter; and upon all occasions, when the Pazzi came in competition
with other citizens, their claims to distinction, however strong, were
set aside by the magistracy. Francesco de' Pazzi, being at Rome, the
Council of Eight, upon some trivial occasion, compelled him to return,
without treating him with the respect usually observed toward great
citizens, so that the Pazzi everywhere bitterly complained of the
ill usage they experienced, and thus excited suspicion in others, and
brought down greater evils upon themselves. Giovanni de' Pazzi had
married the daughter of Giovanni Buonromei, a very wealthy man, whose
riches on his decease, without other children, came to his daughter. His
nephew, Carlo, however, took possession of part, and the question being
litigated, a law was passed, by virtue of which the wife of Giovanni de'
Pazzi was robbed of her inheritance, and it was given to Carlo. In this
piece of injustice the Pazzi at once recognized the influence of the
Medici. Giuliano de' Medici often complained to his brother Lorenzo of
the affair, saying he was afraid that by grasping at too much they would
lose all.

Lorenzo, flushed with youth and power, would assume the direction of
everything, and resolved that all transactions should bear an impress
of his influence. The Pazzi, with their nobility and wealth unable to
endure so many affronts, began to devise some means of vengeance. The
first who spoke of any attempt against the Medici, was Francesco, who,
being more sensitive and resolute than the others, determined either to
obtain what was withheld from him, or lose what he still possessed. As
the government of Florence gave him great offense, he resided almost
constantly at Rome, where, like other Florentine merchants, he conducted
extensive commercial operations; and being a most intimate friend of
Count Girolamo, they frequently complained to each other of the conduct
of the Medici. After a while they began to think that for the count to
retain his estates, or the Pazzi their rights in the city, it would be
necessary to change the government of Florence; and this they considered
could not be done without the death of Giuliano and Lorenzo. They
imagined the pope and the king would be easily induced to consent,
because each could be convinced of the facility of the enterprise.
Having acquired these ideas, they communicated them to Francesco
Salviati, archbishop of Pisa, who, being ambitious and recently offended
by the Medici, willingly adopted their views. Considering their next
step, they resolved, in order to facilitate the design, to obtain the
consent of Jacopo de' Pazzi, without whose concurrence they feared it
would be impracticable. With this view, it was resolved that Francesco
de' Pazzi should go to Florence, while the archbishop and the count
were to remain at Rome, to be ready to communicate with the pope when
a suitable opportunity occurred. Francesco found Jacopo de' Pazzi more
cautious and difficult to persuade than he could have wished, and on
imparting this to his friends at Rome, it was thought he desired the
sanction of some greater authority to induce him to adopt their views.
Upon this, the archbishop and the count communicated the whole affair to
Giovanni Batista da Montesecco, a leader of the papal forces, possessing
military reputation, and under obligations to the pope and the count.
To him the affair seemed difficult and dangerous, while the archbishop
endeavored to obviate his objections by showing how much assistance
the pope and the king would lend to the enterprise; the hatred of the
Florentines toward the Medici, the numerous friends the Salviati and
the Pazzi would bring with them, the readiness with which the young men
might be slain, on account of their going about the city unaccompanied
and without suspicion, and the facility with which the government
might then be changed. These things Giovanni Batista did not in
reality believe, for he had heard from many Florentines quite contrary
statements.

While occupied with these deliberations, Carlo, lord of Faenza, was
taken ill, and tears were entertained for his life. This circumstance
seemed to the archbishop and the count to offer an opportunity for
sending Giovanni Batista to Florence, and thence to Romagna, under
pretence of recovering certain territories belonging to the latter,
of which the lord of Faenza had taken possession. The count therefore
commissioned Giovanni Batista to have an interview with Lorenzo de'
Medici, and on his part request his advice how to proceed with respect
to the affair of Romagna; that he should then see Francesco de' Pazzi,
and in conjunction with him endeavor to induce his uncle Jacopo to adopt
their ideas. To render the pope's authority available in their behalf,
Giovanni Batista was ordered, before his departure, to communicate with
the pontiff, who offered every means at his disposal in favor of their
enterprise. Giovanni Batista, having arrived at Florence, obtained an
interview with Lorenzo, by whom he was most graciously received; and
with regard to the advice he was commissioned to ask, obtained a wise
and friendly answer; so that he was astonished at finding him quite a
different character from what he had been represented, and considered
him to possess great sagacity, an affectionate heart, and most amicably
disposed toward the count. He found Francesco de' Pazzi had gone to
Lucca, and spoke to Jacopo, who was at first quite opposed to their
design, but before they parted the pope's authority seemed to have
influenced him; for he told Giovanni Batista, that he might go to
Romagna, and that before his return Francesco would be with him, and
they would then consult more particularly upon the subject. Giovanni
Batista proceeded to Romagna, and soon returned to Florence. After
a pretended consultation with Lorenzo, upon the count's affairs, he
obtained an interview with Francesco and Jacopo de' Pazzi, when the
latter gave his consent to their enterprise. They then discussed the
means of carrying it into effect. Jacopo de' Pazzi was of opinion that
it could not be effected while both the brothers remained at Florence;
and therefore it would be better to wait till Lorenzo went to Rome,
whither it was reported he had an intention of going; for then their
object would be more easily attained. Francesco de' Pazzi had no
objection to Lorenzo being at Rome, but if he were to forego the
journey, he thought that both the brothers might be slain, either at
a marriage, or at a play, or in a church. With regard to foreign
assistance, he supposed the pope might assemble forces for the conquest
of the fortress of Montone, being justified in taking it from Count
Carlo, who had caused the tumults already spoken of in Sienna and
Perugia.

Still no definite arrangement was made; but it was resolved that
Giovanni Batista and Francesco de' Pazzi should go to Rome and settle
everything with the pontiff. The matter was again debated at Rome; and
at length it was concluded that besides an expedition against Montone,
Giovan Francesco da Tolentino, a leader of the papal troops, should go
into Romagna, and Lorenzo da Castello to the Val di Tavere; that each,
with the forces of the country, should hold himself in readiness to
perform the commands of the archbishop de' Salviati and Francesco
de Pazzi, both of whom were to come to Florence, and provide for the
execution of their design, with the assistance of Giovanni Batista da
Montesecco. King Ferrando promised, by his ambassador, to contribute all
in his power to the success of their undertaking. Francesco de' Pazzi
and the archbishop having arrived at Florence, prevailed upon Jacopo
di Poggio, a well educated youth, but ambitious and very desirous
of change, to join them, and two others, each of the name of Jacopo
Salviati, one a brother, the other a kinsman, of the archbishop. They
also gained over Bernardo Bandini and Napoleone Franzeni, two bold young
men, under great obligations to the family of the Pazzi. Besides those
already mentioned, they were joined by Antonio da Volterra and a priest
named Stefano, who taught Latin to the daughter of Jacopo de' Pazzi.
Rinato de' Pazzi, a grave and prudent man, being quite aware of the
evils resulting from such undertakings, refused all participation in the
conspiracy; he held it in abhorrence, and as much as possible, without
betraying his kinsmen, endeavored to counteract it.

The pope had sent Raffaello di Riario, a nephew of Count Girolamo, to
the college of Pisa, to study canon law, and while there, had advanced
him to the dignity of a cardinal. The conspirators determined to bring
this cardinal to Florence, as they would thus be better able to conceal
their design, since any persons requisite to be introduced into the city
might easily be made to appear as a part of his retinue, and his arrival
might facilitate the completion of their enterprise. The cardinal came,
and was received by Jacopo de' Pazzi at his villa of Montughi, near
Florence. By his means it was also intended to bring together Giuliano
and Lorenzo, and whenever this happened, to put them both to death. They
therefore invited them to meet the cardinal at their villa of Fiesole;
but Giuliano, either intentionally or through some preventing cause, did
not attend; and this design having failed, they thought that if asked to
an entertainment at Florence, both brothers would certainly be present.
With this intention they appointed Sunday, the twenty-sixth of April,
1478, to give a great feast; and, resolving to assassinate them at
table, the conspirators met on the Saturday evening to arrange all
proceedings for the following day. In the morning it was intimated to
Francesco that Giuliano would be absent; on which the conspirators again
assembled and finding they could no longer defer the execution of their
design, since it would be impossible among so many to preserve secrecy,
they determined to complete it in the cathedral church of Santa
Reparata, where the cardinal attending, the two brothers would be
present as usual. They wished Giovanni Batista da Montesecco to
undertake the murder of Lorenzo, while that of Giuliano was assigned
to Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini. Giovanni Batista refused,
either because his familiarity with Lorenzo had created feelings in his
favor, or from some other reason, saying he should not have resolution
sufficient to commit such a deed in a church, and thus add sacrilege
to treachery. This caused the failure of their undertaking; for time
pressing, they were compelled to substitute Antonio da Volterra and
Stefano, the priest, two men, who, from nature and habit, were the most
unsuitable of any; for if firmness and resolution joined with experience
in bloodshed be necessary upon any occasion, it is on such as these; and
it often happens that those who are expert in arms, and have faced death
in all forms on the field of battle, still fail in an affair like this.
Having now decided upon the time, they resolved that the signal for the
attack should be the moment when the priest who celebrated high
mass should partake of the sacrament, and that, in the meantime, the
Archbishop de' Salviati, with his followers, and Jacopo di Poggio,
should take possession of the palace, in order that the Signory, after
the young men's death, should voluntarily, or by force, contribute to
their assistance.



CHAPTER II

Giuliano de' Medici slain--Lorenzo escapes--The archbishop Salviati
endeavors to seize the palace of the Signory--He is taken
and hanged--The enterprise of the conspirators entirely
fails--Manifestations of the Florentines in favor of Lorenzo de'
Medici--The conspirators punished--The funeral of Giuliano--The pope
and the king of Naples make war upon the Florentines--Florence
excommunicated--Speech of Lorenzo de' Medici to the citizens of
Florence.

The conspirators proceeded to Santa Reparata, where the cardinal and
Lorenzo had already arrived. The church was crowded, and divine service
commenced before Giuliano's arrival. Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo
Bandini, who were appointed to be his murderers, went to his house,
and finding him, they, by earnest entreaties, prevailed upon him to
accompany them. It is surprising that such intense hatred, and designs
so full of horror as those of Francesco and Bernardo, could be so
perfectly concealed; for while conducting him to the church, and after
they had reached it, they amused him with jests and playful discourse.
Nor did Francesco forget, under pretense of endearment, to press him in
his arms, so as to ascertain whether under his apparel he wore a cuirass
or other means of defense. Giuliano and Lorenzo were both aware of
the animosity of the Pazzi, and their desire to deprive them of the
government; but they felt assured that any design would be attempted
openly, and in conjunction with the civil authority. Thus being free
from apprehension for their personal safety both affected to be on
friendly terms with them. The murderers being ready, each in his
appointed station, which they could retain without suspicion, on account
of the vast numbers assembled in the church, the preconcerted moment
arrived, and Bernardo Bandini, with a short dagger provided for the
purpose, struck Giuliano in the breast, who, after a few steps, fell to
the earth. Francesco de' Pazzi threw himself upon the body and covered
him with wounds; while, as if blinded by rage, he inflicted a deep
incision upon his own leg. Antonio and Stefano, the priest, attacked
Lorenzo, and after dealing many blows, effected only a slight incision
in the throat; for either their want of resolution, the activity
of Lorenzo, who, finding himself attacked, used his arms in his own
defense, or the assistance of those by whom he was surrounded, rendered
all attempts futile. They fled and concealed themselves, but being
subsequently discovered, were put to death in the most ignominious
manner, and their bodies dragged about the city. Lorenzo, with the
friends he had about him, took refuge in the sacristy of the church.
Bernardo Bandini, after Giuliano's death, also slew Francesco Nori, a
most intimate friend of the Medici, either from some previous hatred or
for having endeavored to render assistance to Giuliano; and not content
with these murders, he ran in pursuit of Lorenzo, intending, by his own
promptitude, to make up for the weakness and inefficiency of the others;
but finding he had taken refuge in the vestry, he was prevented.

In the midst of these violent and fearful deeds, during which the uproar
was so terrible, that it seemed almost sufficient to bring the church
down upon its inmates, the cardinal Riario remained close to the altar,
where he was with difficulty kept in safety by the priests, until the
Signory, upon the abatement of the disturbance, could conduct him to
their palace, where he remained in the utmost terror till he was set at
liberty.

There were at this time in Florence some people of Perugia, whom party
feuds had compelled to leave their homes; and the Pazzi, by promising to
restore them to their country, obtained their assistance. The Archbishop
de' Salviati, going to seize the palace, together with Jacopo di Poggio,
and the Salviati, his friends, took these Perugini with him. Having
arrived, he left part of his people below, with orders that when they
heard a noise they should make themselves masters of the entrance, while
himself, with the greater part of the Perugini, proceeded above, and
finding the Signory at dinner (for it was now late), was admitted
after a short delay, by Cesare Petrucci, the Gonfalonier of Justice. He
entered with only a few of his followers, the greater part of them being
shut up in the cancelleria into which they had gone, whose doors were so
contrived, that upon closing they could not be opened from either
side, without the key. The archbishop being with the gonfalonier, under
pretense of having something to communicate on the part of the pope,
addressed him in such an incoherent and hesitating manner, that the
gonfalonier at once suspected him, and rushing out of the chamber to
call assistance, found Jacopo di Poggio, whom he seized by the hair
of the head, and gave into the custody of his attendants. The Signory
hearing the tumult, snatched such arms as they could at the moment
obtain, and all who had gone up with the archbishop, part of them being
shut up, and part overcome with terror, were immediately slain or thrown
alive out of the windows of the palace, at which the archbishop, the
two Jacopi Salviati, and Jacopodi Poggio were hanged. Those whom the
archbishop left below, having mastered the guard and taken possession of
the entrance occupied all the lower floors, so that the citizens, who in
the uproar, hastened to the palace, were unable to give either advice or
assistance to the Signory.

Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini, perceiving Lorenzo's escape,
and the principal agent in the enterprise seriously wounded, became
immediately conscious of the imminent peril of their position. Bernardo,
using the same energy in his own behalf that had served him against the
Medici, finding all lost, saved himself by flight. Francesco, wounded as
he was, got to his house, and endeavored to get on horseback, for it had
been arranged they should ride through the city and call the people to
arms and liberty; but he found himself unable, from the nature of his
wound, and, throwing himself naked upon his bed, begged Jacopo de' Pazzi
to perform the part for which he was himself incapacitated. Jacopo,
though old and unaccustomed to such business, by way of making a last
effort, mounted his horse, and, with about a hundred armed followers,
collected without previous preparation, hastened to the piazza of the
palace, and endeavored to assemble adherents by cries of "people," and
"liberty;" but the former, having been rendered deaf by the fortune and
liberty of the Medici, the latter was unknown in Florence, and he
found no followers. The signors, who held the upper part of the palace,
saluted him with stones and threats. Jacopo, while hesitating, was met
by Giovanni Seristori, his brother-in-law, who upbraided him with the
troubles he had occasioned, and then advised him to go home, for the
people and liberty were as dear to other citizens as to himself.
Thus deprived of every hope, Lorenzo being alive, Francesco seriously
wounded, and none disposed to follow him, not knowing what to do, he
resolved, if possible, to escape by flight; and, accompanied by those
whom he had led into the piazza, left Florence with the intention of
going into Romagna.

In the meantime the whole city was roused to arms, and Lorenzo de'
Medici, accompanied by a numerous escort, returned to his house. The
palace was recovered from its assailants, all of whom were either
slain or made prisoners. The name of the Medici echoed everywhere, and
portions of dead bodies were seen borne on spears and scattered through
the streets; while everyone was transported with rage against the Pazzi,
and pursued them with relentless cruelty. The people took possession
of their houses, and Francesco, naked as they found him, was led to the
palace, and hanged beside the archbishop and the rest. He could not
be induced, by any injurious words or deeds, to utter a syllable, but
regarding those around with a steady look, he silently sighed. Guglielmo
de' Pazzi, brother-in-law to Lorenzo, fled to the latter's house, and
by his innocence and the intercession of his wife, Bianca, he escaped
death. There was not a citizen of any rank whatever who did not, upon
this occasion, wait upon Lorenzo with an offer of his services; so great
were the popularity and good fortune which this family had acquired by
their liberality and prudence. Rinato de' Pazzi was at his villa when
the event took place, and on being informed of it, he endeavored to
escape in disguise, but was arrested upon the road and brought to
Florence. Jacopo de' Pazzi was taken while crossing the mountains
of Romagna, for the inhabitants of these parts having heard what had
occurred, and seeing him in flight, attacked and brought him back to the
city; nor could he, though he frequently endeavored, prevail with them
to put him to death upon the road. Jacopo and Rinato were condemned
within four days after the murder of Giuliano. And though so many deaths
had been inflicted that the roads were covered with fragments of human
bodies, not one excited a feeling of regret, except that of Rinato; for
he was considered a wise and good man, and possessed none of the pride
for which the rest of his family were notorious. As if to mark the event
by some extraordinary circumstance, Jacopo de' Pazzi, after having
been buried in the tomb of his ancestors, was disinterred like an
excommunicated person, and thrown into a hole at the outside of the city
walls; from this grave he was taken, and with the halter in which he
had been hanged, his body was dragged naked through the city, and, as
if unfit for sepulture on earth, thrown by the populace into the Arno,
whose waters were then very high. It was an awful instance of the
instability of fortune, to see so wealthy a man, possessing the utmost
earthly felicity, brought down to such a depth of misery, such utter
ruin and extreme degradation. It is said he had vices, among which were
gaming and profane swearing, to which he was very much addicted; but
these seem more than balanced by his numerous charities, for he relieved
many in distress, and bestowed much money for pious uses. It may also
be recorded in his favor, that upon the Saturday preceding the death
of Giuliano, in order that none might suffer from his misfortunes, he
discharged all his debts; and whatever property he possessed belonging
to others, either in his own house or his place of business, he was
particularly careful to return to its owners. Giovanni Batista da
Montesecco, after a long examination, was beheaded; Napoleone Franzesi
escaped punishment by flight; Giulielmo de' Pazzi was banished, and
such of his cousins as remained alive were imprisoned in the fortress
of Volterra. The disturbances being over, and the conspirators punished,
the funeral obsequies of Giuliano were performed amid universal
lamentation; for he possessed all the liberality and humanity that could
be wished for in one of his high station. He left a natural son, born
some months after his death, named Giulio, who was endowed with that
virtue and felicity with which the whole world is now acquainted; and
of which we shall speak at length when we come to our own times, if
God spare us. The people who had assembled in favor of the Pazzi under
Lorenzo da Castello in the Val di Tavere, and under Giovan Francesco
da Tolentino in Romagna, approached Florence, but having heard of the
failure of the conspiracy, they returned home.

The changes desired by the pope and the king in the government of
Florence, not having taken place, they determined to effect by war what
they had failed to accomplish by treachery; and both assembled forces
with all speed to attack the Florentine states; publicly declaring that
they only wished the citizens to remove Lorenzo de' Medici, who alone
of all the Florentines was their enemy. The king's forces had already
passed the Tronto, and the pope's were in Perugia; and that the citizens
might feel the effect of spiritual as well as temporal weapons, the
pontiff excommunicated and anathematized them. Finding themselves
attacked by so many armies, the Florentines prepared for their defense
with the utmost care. Lorenzo de' Medici, as the enemy's operations
were said to be directed against himself alone, resolved first of all to
assemble the Signory, and the most influential citizens, in the
palace, to whom, being above three hundred in number, he spoke as
follows:--"Most excellent signors, and you, magnificent citizens, I know
not whether I have more occasion to weep with you for the events which
have recently occurred, or to rejoice in the circumstances with which
they have been attended. Certainly, when I think with what virulence of
united deceit and hatred I have been attacked, and my brother murdered,
I cannot but mourn and grieve from my heart, from my very soul. Yet when
I consider with what promptitude, anxiety, love, and unanimity of the
whole city my brother has been avenged and myself defended, I am not
only compelled to rejoice, but feel myself honored and exalted; for if
experience has shown me that I had more enemies than I apprehended, it
has also proved that I possess more warm and resolute friends than I
could ever have hoped for. I must therefore grieve with you for the
injuries others have suffered, and rejoice in the attachment you have
exhibited toward myself; but I feel more aggrieved by the injuries
committed, since they are so unusual, so unexampled, and (as I trust you
believe) so undeserved on our part. Think, magnificent citizens, to what
a dreadful point ill fortune has reduced our family, when among friends,
amidst our own relatives, nay, in God's holy temple, we have found
our greatest foes. Those who are in danger turn to their friends for
assistance; they call upon their relatives for aid; but we found ours
armed, and resolved on our destruction. Those who are persecuted, either
from public or private motives, flee for refuge to the altars; but where
others are safe, we are assassinated; where parricides and assassins are
secure, the Medici find their murderers. But God, who has not hitherto
abandoned our house, again saved us, and has undertaken the defense of
our just cause. What injury have we done to justify so intense desire of
our destruction? Certainly those who have shown themselves so much our
enemies, never received any private wrong from us; for, had we wished to
injure them, they would not have had an opportunity of injuring us. If
they attribute public grievances to ourselves (supposing any had been
done to them), they do the greater injustices to you, to this palace,
to the majesty of this government, by assuming that on our account you
would act unfairly to any of your citizens; and such a supposition, as
we all know, is contradicted by every view of the circumstances; for
we, had we been able, and you, had we wished it, would never have
contributed to so abominable a design. Whoever inquires into the truth
of these matters, will find that our family has always been exalted
by you, and from this sole cause, that we have endeavored by kindness,
liberality, and beneficence, to do good to all; and if we have honored
strangers, when did we ever injure our relatives? If our enemies'
conduct has been adopted, to gratify their desire for power (as would
seem to be the case from their having taken possession of the palace and
brought an armed force into the piazza), the infamous, ambitious, and
detestable motive is at once disclosed. If they were actuated by envy
and hatred of our authority, they offend you rather than us; for from
you we have derived all the influence we possess. Certainly usurped
power deserves to be detested; but not distinctions conceded for acts of
kindness, generosity, and magnificence. And you all know that our family
never attained any rank to which this palace and your united consent did
not raise it. Cosmo, my grandfather, did not return from exile with arms
and violence, but by your unanimous desire and approbation. It was not
my father, old and inform, who defended the government against so many
enemies, but yourselves by your authority and benevolence defended him;
neither could I, after his death, being then a boy, have maintained the
position of my house except by your favor and advice. Nor should we
ever be able to conduct the affairs of this republic, if you did not
contribute to our support. Therefore, I know not the reason of their
hatred toward us, or what just cause they have of envy. Let them direct
their enmity against their own ancestors, who, by their pride and
avarice, lost the reputation which ours, by very opposite conduct, were
enabled to acquire. But let it be granted we have greatly injured them,
and that they are justified in seeking our ruin; why do they come and
take possession of the palace? Why enter into league with the pope
and the king, against the liberties of this republic? Why break the
long-continued peace of Italy? They have no excuse for this; they ought
to confine their vengeance to those who do them wrong, and not confound
private animosities with public grievances. Hence it is that since their
defeat our misfortune is the greater; for on their account the pope and
the king make war upon us, and this war, they say, is directed against
my family and myself. And would to God that this were true; then the
remedy would be sure and unfailing, for I would not be so base a citizen
as to prefer my own safety to yours; I would at once resolve to ensure
your security, even though my own destruction were the immediate and
inevitable consequence. But as the wrongs committed by princes are
usually concealed under some less offensive covering, they have adopted
this plea to hide their more abominable purpose. If, however, you think
otherwise, I am in your hands; it is with you to do with me what you
please. You are my fathers, my protectors, and whatever you command me
to do I will perform most willingly; nor will I ever refuse, when you
find occasion to require it, to close the war with my own blood which
was commenced with that of my brother." While Lorenzo spoke, the
citizens were unable to refrain from tears, and the sympathy with which
he had been heard was extended to their reply, delivered by one of
them in the name of the rest, who said that the city acknowledged many
advantages derived from the good qualities of himself and his family;
and encouraged them to hope that with as much promptitude as they had
used in his defense, and in avenging his brother's death, they would
secure to him his influence in the government, which he should never
lose while they retained possession of the country. And that their deeds
might correspond with their words, they immediately appointed a number
of armed men, as a guard for the security of his person against domestic
enemies.



CHAPTER III

The Florentines prepare for war against the pope--They appeal to
a future council--Papal and Neapolitan movements against
the Florentines--The Venetians refuse to assist the
Florentines--Disturbances in Milan--Genoa revolts from the duke--Futile
endeavors to effect peace with the pope--The Florentines repulse their
enemies from the territory of Pisa--They attack the papal states--The
papal forces routed upon the borders of the Lake of Perugia.

The Florentines now prepared for war, by raising money and collecting
as large a force as possible. Being in league with the duke of Milan
and the Venetians, they applied to both for assistance. As the pope had
proved himself a wolf rather than a shepherd, to avoid being devoured
under false accusations, they justified their cause with all available
arguments, and filled Italy with accounts of the treachery practiced
against their government, exposing the impiety and injustice of the
pontiff, and assured the world that the pontificate which he had
wickedly attained, he would as impiously fill; for he had sent those
whom he had advanced to the highest order of prelacy, in the company
of traitors and parricides, to commit the most horrid treachery in the
church in the midst of divine service and during the celebration of the
holy sacrament, and that then, having failed to murder the citizens,
change the government, and plunder the city, according to his intention,
he had suspended the performance of all religious offices, and
injuriously menaced and injured the republic with pontifical
maledictions. But if God was just, and violence was offensive to him, he
would be displeased with that of his viceregent, and allow his injured
people who were not admitted to communion with the latter, to offer
up their prayers to himself. The Florentines, therefore, instead of
receiving or obeying the interdict, compelled the priests to perform
divine service, assembled a council in Florence of all the Tuscan
prelates under their jurisdiction, and appealed against the injuries
suffered from the pontiff to a future general council.

The pope did not neglect to assign reasons in his own justification, and
maintained it was the duty of a pontiff to suppress tyranny, depress
the wicked, and exalt the good; and that this ought to be done by
every available means; but that secular princes had no right to detain
cardinals, hang bishops, murder, mangle, and drag about the bodies of
priests, destroying without distinction the innocent with the guilty.

Notwithstanding these complaints and accusations, the Florentines
restored to the pope the cardinal whom they had detained, in return for
which he immediately assailed them with his own forces and those of
the king. The two armies, under the command of Alfonso, eldest son of
Ferrando, and duke of Calabria, who had as his general, Federigo, count
of Urbino, entered the Chianti, by permission of the Siennese, who sided
with the enemy, occupied Radda with many other fortresses, and having
plundered the country, besieged the Castellina. The Florentines were
greatly alarmed at these attacks, being almost destitute of forces, and
finding their friends slow to assist; for though the duke sent them aid,
the Venetians denied all obligation to support the Florentines in their
private quarrels, since the animosities of individuals were not to be
defended at the public expense. The Florentines, in order to induce the
Venetians to take a more correct view of the case, sent Tommaso Soderini
as their ambassador to the senate, and, in the meantime, engaged forces,
and appointed Ercole, marquis of Ferrara, to the command of their army.
While these preparations were being made, the Castellina was so hard
pressed by the enemy, that the inhabitants, despairing of relief,
surrendered, after having sustained a siege of forty-two days. The
enemy then directed their course toward Arezzo, and encamped before San
Savino. The Florentine army being now in order, went to meet them,
and having approached within three miles, caused such annoyance, that
Federigo d'Urbino demanded a truce for a few days, which was granted,
but proved so disadvantageous to the Florentines, that those who had
made the request were astonished at having obtained it; for, had it been
refused, they would have been compelled to retire in disgrace. Having
gained these few days to recruit themselves, as soon as they were
expired, they took the castle in the presence of their enemies. Winter
being now come, the forces of the pope and king retired for convenient
quarters to the Siennese territory. The Florentines also withdrew to
a more commodious situation, and the marquis of Ferrara, having done
little for himself and less for others, returned to his own territories.

At this time, Genoa withdrew from the dominion of Milan, under the
following circumstances. Galeazzo, at his death, left a son, Giovan
Galeazzo, who being too young to undertake the government, dissensions
arose between Sforza, Lodovico, Ottaviano, and Ascanio, his uncles, and
the lady Bona, his mother, each of whom desired the guardianship of the
young duke. By the advice and mediation of Tommaso Soderini, who
was then Florentine ambassador at the court of Milan, and of Cecco
Simonetta, who had been secretary to Galeazzo, the lady Bona prevailed.
The uncles fled, Ottaviano was drowned in crossing the Adda; the rest
were banished to various places, together with Roberto da San Severino,
who in these disputes had deserted the duchess and joined the uncles
of the duke. The troubles in Tuscany, which immediately followed,
gave these princes hope that the new state of things would present
opportunities for their advantage; they therefore quitted the places to
which their exile limited them, and each endeavored to return home. King
Ferrando, finding the Florentines had obtained assistance from none but
the Milanese, took occasion to give the duchess so much occupation
in her own government, as to render her unable to contribute to their
assistance. By means of Prospero Adorno, the Signor Roberto, and the
rebellious uncles of the duke, he caused Genoa to throw off the Milanese
yoke. The Castelletto was the only place left; confiding in which, the
duchess sent a strong force to recover the city, but it was routed by
the enemy; and perceiving the danger which might arise to her son and
herself if the war were continued, Tuscany being in confusion, and the
Florentines, in whom alone she had hope, themselves in trouble, she
determined, as she could not retain Genoa in subjection, to secure it
as an ally; and agreed with Battistino Fregoso, the enemy of Prospero
Adorno, to give him the Castelletto, and make him prince of Genoa, on
condition that he should expel Prospero, and do nothing in favor of her
son's uncles. Upon this agreement, Battistino, by the assistance of the
Castelletto and of his friends, became lord of Genoa; and according to
the custom of the city, took the title of Doge. The Sforzeschi and the
Signor Roberto, being thus expelled by the Genoese, came with their
forces into Lunigiana, and the pope and the king, perceiving the
troubles of Lombardy to be composed, took occasion with them to annoy
Tuscany in the Pisan territory, that the Florentines might be weakened
by dividing their forces. At the close of winter they ordered Roberto
da San Severino to leave Lunigiana and march thither, which he did, and
with great tumult plundered many fortresses, and overran the country
around Pisa.

At this time, ambassadors came to Florence from the emperor, the king of
France, and the king of Hungary, who were sent by their princes to the
pontiff. They solicited the Florentines also to send ambassadors to the
pope, and promised to use their utmost exertion to obtain for them an
advantageous peace. The Florentines did not refuse to make trial, both
for the sake of publicly justifying their proceedings, and because they
were really desirous of peace. Accordingly, the ambassadors were sent,
but returned without coming to any conclusion of their differences. The
Florentines, to avail themselves of the influence of the king of France,
since they were attacked by one part of the Italians and abandoned
by the other, sent to him as their ambassador, Donato Acciajuoli, a
distinguished Latin and Greek scholar, whose ancestors had always ranked
high in the city, but while on his journey he died at Milan. To relieve
his surviving family and pay a deserved tribute to his memory, he was
honorably buried at the public expense, provision was made for his sons,
and suitable marriage portions given to his daughters, and Guid' Antonio
Vespucci, a man well acquainted with pontifical and imperial affairs,
was sent as ambassador to the king in his stead.

The attack of Signor Roberto upon the Pisan territory, being unexpected,
greatly perplexed the Florentines; for having to resist the foe in the
direction of Sienna, they knew not how to provide for the places about
Pisa. To keep the Lucchese faithful, and prevent them from furnishing
the enemy either with money or provisions, they sent as ambassador Piero
di Gino Capponi, who was received with so much jealousy, on account of
the hatred which that city always cherishes against the Florentines
from former injuries and constant fear, that he was on many occasions in
danger of being put to death by the mob; and thus his mission gave fresh
cause of animosity rather than of union. The Florentines recalled the
marquis of Ferrara, and engaged the marquis of Mantua; they also as
earnestly requested the Venetians to send them Count Carlo, son of
Braccio, and Deifobo, son of Count Jacopo, and after many delays, they
complied; for having made a truce with the Turks, they had no excuse
to justify a refusal, and could not break through the obligation of the
League without the utmost disgrace. The counts, Carlo and Deifobo, came
with a good force, and being joined by all that could be spared from
the army, which, under the marquis of Ferrara, held in check the duke
of Calabria, proceeded toward Pisa, to meet Signor Roberto, who was with
his troops near the river Serchio, and who, though he had expressed his
intention of awaiting their arrival, withdrew to the camp at Lunigiana,
which he had quitted upon coming into the Pisan territory, while Count
Carlo recovered all the places that had been taken by the enemy in that
district.

The Florentines, being thus relieved from the attack in the direction of
Pisa, assembled the whole force between Colle and Santo Geminiano. But
the army, on the arrival of Count Carlo, being composed of Sforzeschi
and Bracceschi, their hereditary feuds soon broke forth, and it was
thought that if they remained long in company, they would turn their
arms against each other. It was therefore determined, as the smaller
evil, to divide them; to send one party, under Count Carlo, into the
district of Perugia, and establish the other at Poggibonzi, where
they formed a strong encampment in order to prevent the enemy from
penetrating the Florentine territory. By this they also hoped to compel
the enemy to divide their forces; for Count Carlo was understood to have
many partisans in Perugia, and it was therefore expected, either that
he would occupy the place, or that the pope would be compelled to send
a large body of men for its defense. To reduce the pontiff to greater
necessity, they ordered Niccolo Vitelli, who had been expelled from
Citta di Castello, where his enemy Lorenzo Vitelli commanded, to lead a
force against that place, with the view of driving out his adversary
and withdrawing it from obedience to the pope. At the beginning of the
campaign, fortune seemed to favor the Florentines; for Count Carlo made
rapid advances in the Perugino, and Niccolo Vitelli, though unable to
enter Castello, was superior in the field, and plundered the surrounding
country without opposition. The forces also, at Poggibonzi, constantly
overran the country up to the walls of Sienna. These hopes, however,
were not realized; for in the first place, Count Carlo died, while in
the fullest tide of success; though the consequences of this would have
been less detrimental to the Florentines, had not the victory to which
it gave occasion, been nullified by the misconduct of others. The death
of the count being known, the forces of the church, which had already
assembled in Perugia, conceived hopes of overcoming the Florentines, and
encamped upon the lake, within three miles of the enemy. On the other
side, Jacopo Guicciardini, commissary to the army, by the advice
of Roberto da Rimino, who, after the death of Count Carlo, was the
principal commander, knowing the ground of their sanguine expectations,
determined to meet them, and coming to an engagement near the lake,
upon the site of the memorable rout of the Romans, by Hannibal, the
Carthaginian general, the papal forces were vanquished. The news of the
victory, which did great honor to the commanders, diffused universal
joy at Florence, and would have ensured a favorable termination of the
campaign, had not the disorders which arose in the army at Poggibonzi
thrown all into confusion; for the advantage obtained by the valor of
the one, was more than counterbalanced by the disgraceful proceedings
of the other. Having made considerable booty in the Siennese territory,
quarrels arose about the division of it between the marquis of Mantua
and the marquis of Ferrara, who, coming to arms, assailed each other
with the utmost fury; and the Florentines seeing they could no longer
avail themselves of the services of both, allowed the marquis of Ferrara
and his men to return home.



CHAPTER IV

The duke of Calabria routs the Florentine army at Poggibonzi--Dismay in
Florence on account of the defeat--Progress of the duke of Calabria--The
Florentines wish for peace--Lorenzo de' Medici determines to go to
Naples to treat with the king--Lodovico Sforza, surnamed the Moor, and
his brothers, recalled to Milan--Changes in the government of that city
in consequence--The Genoese take Serezana--Lorenzo de' Medici arrives
at Naples--Peace concluded with the king--The pope and the Venetians
consent to the peace--The Florentines in fear of the duke of
Calabria--Enterprises of the Turks--They take Otranto--The Florentines
reconciled with the pope--Their ambassadors at the papal court--The
pope's reply to the ambassadors--The king of Naples restores to the
Florentines all the fortresses he had taken.

The army being thus reduced, without a leader, and disorder prevailing
in every department, the duke of Calabria, who was with his forces near
Sienna, resolved to attack them immediately. The Florentines, finding
the enemy at hand, were seized with a sudden panic; neither their arms,
nor their numbers, in which they were superior to their adversaries,
nor their position, which was one of great strength, could give them
confidence; but observing the dust occasioned by the enemy's approach,
without waiting for a sight of them, they fled in all directions,
leaving their ammunition, carriages, and artillery to be taken by the
foe. Such cowardice and disorder prevailed in the armies of those times,
that the turning of a horse's head or tail was sufficient to decide the
fate of an expedition. This defeat loaded the king's troops with booty,
and filled the Florentines with dismay; for the city, besides the war,
was afflicted with pestilence, which prevailed so extensively, that all
who possessed villas fled to them to escape death. This occasioned the
defeat to be attended with greater horror; for those citizens whose
possessions lay in the Val di Pesa and the Val d'Elsa, having retired to
them, hastened to Florence with all speed as soon as they heard of the
disaster, taking with them not only their children and their property,
but even their laborers; so that it seemed as if the enemy were expected
every moment in the city. Those who were appointed to the management
of the war, perceiving the universal consternation, commanded the
victorious forces in the Perugino to give up their enterprise in that
direction, and march to oppose the enemy in the Val d'Elsa, who, after
their victory, plundered the country without opposition; and although
the Florentine army had so closely pressed the city of Perugia that
it was expected to fall into their hands every instant, the people
preferred defending their own possessions to endeavoring to seize those
of others. The troops, thus withdrawn from the pursuit of their good
fortune, were marched to San Casciano, a castle within eight miles of
Florence; the leaders thinking they could take up no other position till
the relics of the routed army were assembled. On the other hand, the
enemy being under no further restraint at Perugia, and emboldened by
the departure of the Florentines, plundered to a large amount in the
districts of Arezzo and Cortona; while those who under Alfonso, duke
of Calabria, had been victorious near Poggibonzi, took the town itself;
sacked Vico and Certaldo, and after these conquests and pillagings
encamped before the fortress of Colle, which was considered very strong;
and as the garrison was brave and faithful to the Florentines, it was
hoped they would hold the enemy at bay till the republic was able to
collect its forces. The Florentines being at Santo Casciano, and the
enemy continuing to use their utmost exertions against Colle, they
determined to draw nearer, that the inhabitants might be more resolute
in their defense, and the enemy assail them less boldly. With this
design they removed their camp from Santo Casciano to Santo Geminiano,
about five miles from Colle, and with light cavalry and other suitable
forces were able every day to annoy the duke's camp. All this, however,
was insufficient to relieve the people of Colle; for, having consumed
their provisions, they were compelled to surrender on the thirteenth of
November, to the great grief of the Florentines, and joy of the enemy,
more especially of the Siennese, who, besides their habitual hatred of
the Florentines, had a particular animosity against the people of Colle.

It was now the depth of winter, and the weather so unsuitable for war,
that the pope and the king, either designing to hold out a hope of
peace, or more quietly to enjoy the fruit of their victories, proposed a
truce for three months to the Florentines, and allowed them ten days to
consider the reply. The offer was eagerly accepted; but as wounds are
well known to be more painful after the blood cools than when they
were first received, this brief repose awakened the Florentines to a
consciousness of the miseries they had endured; and the citizens openly
laid the blame upon each other, pointing out the errors committed in the
management of the war, the expenses uselessly incurred, and the taxes
unjustly imposed. These matters were boldly discussed, not only in
private circles, but in the public councils; and one individual even
ventured to turn to Lorenzo de' Medici, and say, "The city is exhausted,
and can endure no more war; it is therefore necessary to think of
peace." Lorenzo was himself aware of the necessity, and assembled the
friends in whose wisdom and fidelity he had the greatest confidence,
when it was at once concluded, that as the Venetians were lukewarm and
unfaithful, and the duke in the power of his guardians, and involved
in domestic difficulties, it would be desirable by some new alliance to
give a better turn to their affairs. They were in doubt whether to apply
to the king or to the pope; but having examined the question in all
sides, they preferred the friendship of the king as more suitable and
secure; for the short reigns of the pontiffs, the changes ensuing upon
each succession, the disregard shown by their church toward temporal
princes, and the still greater want of respect for them exhibited in
her determinations, render it impossible for a secular prince to trust
a pontiff, or safely to share his fortune; for an adherent of the pope
will have a companion in victory, but in defeat must stand alone, while
the pontiff is sustained by his spiritual power and influence. Having
therefore decided that the king's friendship would be of the greatest
utility to them, they thought it would be most easily and certainly
obtained by Lorenzo's presence; for in proportion to the confidence they
evinced toward him, the greater they imagined would be the probability
of removing his impressions of past enmities. Lorenzo having resolved to
go to Naples, recommended the city and government to the care of Tommaso
Soderini, who was at that time Gonfalonier of Justice. He left Florence
at the beginning of December, and having arrived at Pisa, wrote to
the government to acquaint them with the cause of his departure. The
Signory, to do him honor, and enable him the more effectually to treat
with the king, appointed him ambassador from the Florentine people, and
endowed him with full authority to make such arrangements as he thought
most useful for the republic.

At this time Roberto da San Severino, with Lodovico and Ascanio (Sforza
their elder brother being dead) again attacked Milan, in order to
recover the government. Having taken Tortona, and the city and the
whole state being in arms, the duchess Bona was advised to restore the
Sforzeschi, and to put a stop to civil contentions by admitting them to
the government. The person who gave this advice was Antonio Tassino, of
Ferrara, a man of low origin, who, coming to Milan, fell into the hands
of the duke Galeazzo, and was given by him to his duchess for her valet.
He, either from his personal attractions, or some secret influence,
after the duke's death attained such influence over the duchess, that
he governed the state almost at his will. This greatly displeased
the minister Cecco, whom prudence and long experience had rendered
invaluable; and who, to the utmost of his power, endeavored to diminish
the authority of Tassino with the duchess and other members of the
government. The latter, aware of this, to avenge himself for the injury,
and secure defenders against Cecco, advised the duchess to recall the
Sforzeschi, which she did, without communicating her design to the
minister, who, when it was done, said to her, "You have taken a step
which will deprive me of my life, and you of the government." This
shortly afterward took place; for Cecco was put to death by Lodovico,
and Tassino, being expelled from the dukedom, the duchess was so enraged
that she left Milan, and gave up the care of her son to Lodovico, who,
becoming sole governor of the dukedom, caused, as will be hereafter
seen, the ruin of Italy.

Lorenzo de' Medici had set out for Naples, and the truce between the
parties was in force, when, quite unexpectedly, Lodovico Fregoso, being
in correspondence with some persons of Serezana, entered the place by
stealth, took possession of it with an armed force, and imprisoned the
Florentine governor. This greatly offended the Signory, for they thought
the whole had been concerted with the connivance of King Ferrando. They
complained to the duke of Calabria, who was with the army at Sienna,
of a breach of the truce; and he endeavored to prove, by letters and
embassies, that it had occurred without either his own or his father's
knowledge. The Florentines, however, found themselves in a very awkward
predicament, being destitute of money, the head of the republic in the
power of the king, themselves engaged in a long-standing war with the
latter and the pope, in a new one with the Genoese, and entirely without
friends; for they had no confidence in the Venetians, and on account
of its changeable and unsettled state they were rather apprehensive of
Milan. They had thus only one hope, and that depended upon Lorenzo's
success with the king.

Lorenzo arrived at Naples by sea, and was most honorably received, not
only by Ferrando, but by the whole city, his coming having excited the
greatest expectation; for it being generally understood that the war was
undertaken for the sole purpose of effecting his destruction, the power
of his enemies invested his name with additional lustre. Being admitted
to the king's presence, he spoke with so much propriety upon the affairs
of Italy, the disposition of her princes and people, his hopes
from peace, his fears of the results of war, that Ferrando was more
astonished at the greatness of his mind, the promptitude of his genius,
his gravity and wisdom, than he had previously been at his power.
He consequently treated him with redoubled honor, and began to feel
compelled rather to part with him as a friend, than detain him as an
enemy. However, under various pretexts he kept Lorenzo from December
till March, not only to gain the most perfect knowledge of his own
views, but of those of his city; for he was not without enemies, who
would have wished the king to detain and treat him in the same manner as
Jacopo Piccinino; and, with the ostensible view of sympathizing for him,
pointed out all that would, or rather that they wished should, result
from such a course; at the same time opposing in the council every
proposition at all likely to favor him. By such means as these the
opinion gained ground, that if he were detained at Naples much longer,
the government of Florence would be changed. This caused the king to
postpone their separation more than he would have otherwise done, to
see if any disturbance were likely to arise. But finding everything go
quietly on, Ferrando allowed him to depart on the sixth of March, 1479,
having, with every kind of attention and token of regard, endeavored to
gain his affection, and formed with him a perpetual alliance for their
mutual defense. Lorenzo returned to Florence, and upon presenting
himself before the citizens, the impressions he had created in the
popular mind surrounded him with a halo of majesty brighter than before.
He was received with all the joy merited by his extraordinary qualities
and recent services, in having exposed his own life to the most imminent
peril, in order to restore peace to his country. Two days after his
return, the treaty between the republic of Florence and the king, by
which each party bound itself to defend the other's territories, was
published. The places taken from the Florentines during the war were
to be taken up at the discretion of the king; the Pazzi confined in the
tower of Volterra were to be set at liberty, and a certain sum of money,
for a limited period, was to be paid to the duke of Calabria.

As soon as this peace was publicly known, the pope and the Venetians
were transported with rage; the pope thought himself neglected by
the king; the Venetians entertained similar ideas with regard to the
Florentines, and complained that, having been companions in the war,
they were not allowed to participate in the peace. Reports of this
description being spread abroad, and received with entire credence at
Florence, caused a general fear that the peace thus made would give rise
to greater wars; and therefore the leading members of the government
determined to confine the consideration of the most important affairs to
a smaller number, and formed a council of seventy citizens, in whom the
principal authority was invested. This new regulation calmed the minds
of those desirous of change, by convincing them of the futility of their
efforts. To establish their authority, they in the first place ratified
the treaty of peace with the king, and sent as ambassadors to the pope
Antonio Ridolfi and Piero Nasi. But, notwithstanding the peace, Alfonso,
duke of Calabria, still remained at Sienna with his forces, pretending
to be detained by discords among the citizens, which, he said, had risen
so high, that while he resided outside the city they had compelled
him to enter and assume the office of arbitrator between them. He took
occasion to draw large sums of money from the wealthiest citizens by way
of fines, imprisoned many, banished others, and put some to death; he
thus became suspected, not only by the Siennese but by the Florentines,
of a design to usurp the sovereignty of Sienna; nor was any remedy then
available, for the republic had formed a new alliance with the king,
and were at enmity with the pope and the Venetians. This suspicion was
entertained not only by the great body of the Florentine people, who
were subtle interpreters of appearances, but by the principal members of
the government; and it was agreed, on all hands, that the city never
was in so much danger of losing her liberty. But God, who in similar
extremities has always been her preserver, caused an unhoped-for event
to take place, which gave the pope, the king, and the Venetians other
matters to think of than those in Tuscany.

The Turkish emperor, Mahomet II. had gone with a large army to the siege
of Rhodes, and continued it for several months; but though his forces
were numerous, and his courage indomitable, he found them more than
equalled by those of the besieged, who resisted his attack with such
obstinate valor, that he was at last compelled to retire in disgrace.
Having left Rhodes, part of his army, under the Pasha Achmet, approached
Velona, and, either from observing the facility of the enterprise, or
in obedience to his sovereign's commands, coasting along the Italian
shores, he suddenly landed four thousand soldiers, and attacked the city
of Otranto, which he easily took, plundered, and put all the inhabitants
to the sword. He then fortified the city and port, and having assembled
a large body of cavalry, pillaged the surrounding country. The king,
learning this, and aware of the redoubtable character of his assailant,
immediately sent messengers to all the surrounding powers, to request
assistance against the common enemy, and ordered the immediate return of
the duke of Calabria with the forces at Sienna.

This attack, however it might annoy the duke and the rest of Italy,
occasioned the utmost joy at Florence and Sienna; the latter thinking it
had recovered its liberty, and the former that she had escaped a storm
which threatened her with destruction. These impressions, which were not
unknown to the duke, increased the regret he felt at his departure
from Sienna; and he accused fortune of having, by an unexpected and
unaccountable accident, deprived him of the sovereignty of Tuscany. The
same circumstance changed the disposition of the pope; for although he
had previously refused to receive any ambassador from Florence, he was
now so mollified as to be anxious to listen to any overtures of peace;
and it was intimated to the Florentines, that if they would condescend
to ask the pope's pardon, they would be sure of obtaining it. Thinking
it advisable to seize the opportunity, they sent twelve ambassadors
to the pontiff, who, on their arrival, detained them under different
pretexts before he would admit them to an audience. However, terms were
at length settled, and what should be contributed by each in peace or
war. The messengers were then admitted to the feet of the pontiff, who,
with the utmost pomp, received them in the midst of his cardinals. They
apologized for past occurrences; first showing they had been compelled
by necessity, then blaming the malignity of others, or the rage of the
populace, and their just indignation, and enlarging on the unfortunate
condition of those who are compelled either to fight or die; saying,
that since every extremity is endured in order to avoid death, they had
suffered war, interdicts, and other inconveniences, brought upon them
by recent events, that their republic might escape slavery, which is
the death of free cities. However, if in their necessities they had
committed any offense, they were desirous to make atonement, and trusted
in his clemency, who, after the example of the blessed Redeemer, would
receive them into his compassionate arms.

The pope's reply was indignant and haughty. After reiterating all the
offenses against the church during the late transactions, he said that,
to comply with the precepts of God, he would grant the pardon they
asked, but would have them understand, that it was their duty to obey;
and that upon the next instance of their disobedience, they would
inevitably forfeit, and that most deservedly, the liberty which they had
just been upon the point of losing; for those merit freedom who exercise
themselves in good works and avoid evil; that liberty, improperly used,
injures itself and others; that to think little of God, and less of his
church, is not the part of a free man, but a fool, and one disposed to
evil rather than good, and to effect whose correction is the duty not
only of princes but of every Christian; so that in respect of the recent
events, they had only themselves to blame, who, by their evil deeds, had
given rise to the war, and inflamed it by still worse actions, it having
been terminated by the kindness of others rather than by any merit of
their own. The formula of agreement and benediction was then read; and,
in addition to what had already been considered and agreed upon between
the parties, the pope said, that if the Florentines wished to enjoy the
fruit of his forgiveness, they must maintain fifteen galleys, armed,
and equipped, at their own expense, as long as the Turks should make
war upon the kingdom of Naples. The ambassadors complained much of this
burden in addition to the arrangement already made, but were unable to
obtain any alleviation. However, after their return to Florence, the
Signory sent, as ambassador to the pope, Guidantonio Vespucci, who
had recently returned from France, and who by his prudence brought
everything to an amicable conclusion, obtained many favors from the
pontiff, which were considered as presages of a closer reconciliation.

Having settled their affairs with the pope, Sienna being free,
themselves released from the fear of the king, by the departure of
the duke of Calabria from Tuscany, and the war with the Turks
still continuing, the Florentines pressed the king to restore their
fortresses, which the duke of Calabria, upon quitting the country, had
left in the hands of the Siennese. Ferrando, apprehensive that if he
refused, they would withdraw from the alliance with him, and by new wars
with the Siennese deprive him of the assistance he hoped to obtain from
the pope and other Italian powers, consented that they should be given
up, and by new favors endeavored to attach the Florentines to his
interests. It is thus evident, that force and necessity, not deeds and
obligations, induce princes to keep faith.

The castles being restored, and this new alliance established, Lorenzo
de' Medici recovered the reputation which first the war and then the
peace, when the king's designs were doubtful, had deprived him of; for
at this period there was no lack of those who openly slandered him with
having sold his country to save himself, and said, that in war they had
lost their territories, and in peace their liberty. But the fortresses
being recovered, an honorable treaty ratified with the king, and the
city restored to her former influence, the spirit of public discourse
entirely changed in Florence, a place greatly addicted to gossip, and in
which actions are judged by the success attending them, rather than by
the intelligence employed in their direction; therefore, the citizens
praised Lorenzo extravagantly, declaring that by his prudence he had
recovered in peace, what unfavorable circumstances had taken from them
in war, and that by his discretion and judgment he had done more than
the enemy with all the force of their arms.



CHAPTER V

New occasions of war in Italy--Differences between the marquis of
Ferrara, and the Venetians--The king of Naples and the Florentines
attack the papal states--The pope's defensive arrangements--The
Neapolitan army routed by the papal forces--Progress of the Venetians
against the marquis of Ferrara--The pope makes peace, and enters into
a league against the Venetians--Operations of the League against the
Venetians--The Venetians routed at Bondeno--Their losses--Disunion among
the League--Lodovico Sforza makes peace with the Venetians--Ratified by
the other parties.

The invasion of the Turks had deferred the war which was about to break
forth from the anger of the pope and the Venetians at the peace between
the Florentines and the king. But as the beginning of that invasion was
unexpected and beneficial, its conclusion was equally unlooked for and
injurious; for Mahomet dying suddenly, dissensions arose among his sons,
and the forces which were in Puglia being abandoned by their commander,
surrendered Otranto to the king. The fears which restrained the pope and
the Venetians being thus removed, everyone became apprehensive of new
troubles. On the one hand, was the league of the pope and the Venetians,
and with them the Genoese, Siennese, and other minor powers; on the
other, the Florentines, the king, and the duke, with whom were the
Bolognese and many princes. The Venetians wished to become lords of
Ferrara, and thought they were justified by circumstances in making
the attempt, and hoping for a favorable result. Their differences arose
thus: the marquis of Ferrara affirmed he was under no obligation to
take salt from the Venetians, or to admit their governor; the terms of
convention between them declaring, that after seventy years, the city
was to be free from both impositions. The Venetians replied, that so
long as he held the Polesine, he was bound to receive their salt
and their governor. The marquis refusing his consent, the Venetians
considered themselves justified in taking arms, and that the present
moment offered a suitable opportunity; for the pope was indignant
against the Florentines and the king; and to attach the pope still
further, the Count Girolamo, who was then at Venice, was received with
all possible respect; first admitted to the privileges of a citizen,
and then raised to the rank of a senator, the highest distinctions the
Venetian senate can confer. To prepare for the war, they levied new
taxes, and appointed to the command of the forces, Roberto da San
Severino, who being offended with Lodovico, governor of Milan, fled to
Tortona, whence, after occasioning some disturbances, he went to Genoa,
and while there, was sent for by the Venetians, and placed at the head
of their troops.

These circumstances becoming known to the opposite league, induced it
also to provide for war. The duke of Milan appointed as his general,
Federigo d'Urbino; the Florentines engaged Costanzo, lord of Pesaro;
and to sound the disposition of the pope, and know whether the Venetians
made war against Ferrara with his consent or not, King Ferrando sent
Alfonso, duke of Calabria, with his army across the Tronto, and asked
the pontiff's permission to pass into Lombardy to assist the marquis,
which was refused in the most peremptory manner. The Florentines and
the king, no longer doubtful about the pope's intentions, determined to
harass him, and thus either compel him to take part with them, or
throw such obstacles in his way, as would prevent him from helping
the Venetians, who had already taken the field, attacked the marquis,
overran his territory, and encamped before Figaruolo, a fortress of the
greatest importance. In pursuance of the design of the Florentines and
the king, the duke of Calabria, by the assistance of the Colonna family
(the Orsini had joined the pope), plundered the country about Rome
and committed great devastation; while the Florentines, with Niccolo
Vitelli, besieged and took Citta di Castello, expelling Lorenzo Vitelli,
who held it for the pope, and placing Niccolo in it as prince.

The pope now found himself in very great straits; for the city of Rome
was disturbed by factions and the country covered with enemies. But
acting with courage and resolution, he appointed Roberto da Rimino to
take the command of his forces; and having sent for him to Rome, where
his troops were assembled, told him how great would be the honor, if
he could deliver the church from the king's forces, and the troubles in
which it was involved; how greatly indebted, not only himself, but all
his successors would be, and, that not mankind merely, but God himself
would be under obligations to him. The magnificent Roberto, having
considered the forces and preparations already made, advised the pope to
raise as numerous a body of infantry as possible, which was done without
delay. The duke of Calabria was at hand, and constantly harassed the
country up to the very gates of Rome, which so roused the indignation
of the citizens, that many offered their assistance to Roberto, and
all were thankfully received. The duke, hearing of these preparations,
withdrew a short distance from the city, that in the belief of finding
him gone, the magnificent Roberto would not pursue him, and also in
expectation of his brother Federigo, whom their father had sent to him
with additional forces. But Roberto, finding himself nearly equal to the
duke in cavalry, and superior in infantry, marched boldly out of Rome
and took a position within two miles of the enemy. The duke, seeing his
adversaries close upon him, found he must either fight or disgracefully
retire. To avoid a retreat unbecoming a king's son, he resolved to face
the enemy; and a battle ensued which continued from morning till midday.
In this engagement, greater valor was exhibited on both sides than
had been shown in any other during the last fifty years, upward of a
thousand dead being left upon the field. The troops of the church were
at length victorious, for her numerous infantry so annoyed the ducal
cavalry, that they were compelled to retreat, and Alfonso himself would
have fallen into the hands of the enemy, had he not been rescued by a
body of Turks, who remained at Otranto, and were at that time in his
service. The lord of Rimino, after this victory, returned triumphantly
to Rome, but did not long enjoy the fruit of his valor; for having,
during the heat of the engagement, taken a copious draught of water,
he was seized with a flux, of which he very shortly afterward died. The
pope caused his funeral to be conducted with great pomp, and in a few
days, sent the Count Girolamo toward Citta di Castello to restore it
to Lorenzo, and also endeavor to gain Rimino, which being by Roberto's
death left to the care of his widow and a son who was quite a boy, his
holiness thought might be easily won; and this certainly would have
been the case, if the lady had not been defended by the Florentines,
who opposed him so effectually, as to prevent his success against both
Castello and Rimino.

While these things were in progress at Rome and in Romagna, the
Venetians took possession of Figaruolo and crossed the Po with their
forces. The camp of the duke of Milan and the marquis was in disorder;
for the count of Urbino having fallen ill, was carried to Bologna for
his recovery, but died. Thus the marquis's affairs were unfortunately
situated, while those of the Venetians gave them increasing hopes of
occupying Ferrara. The Florentines and the king of Naples used their
utmost endeavors to gain the pope to their views; and not having
succeeded by force, they threatened him with the council, which had
already been summoned by the emperor to assemble at Basle; and by
means of the imperial ambassadors, and the co-operation of the leading
cardinals, who were desirous of peace, the pope was compelled to turn
his attention toward effecting the pacification of Italy. With this
view, at the instigation of his fears, and with the conviction that the
aggrandizement of the Venetians would be the ruin of the church and of
Italy, he endeavored to make peace with the League, and sent his nuncios
to Naples, where a treaty was concluded for five years, between the
pope, the king, the duke of Milan, and the Florentines, with an opening
for the Venetians to join them if they thought proper. When this was
accomplished, the pope intimated to the Venetians, that they must desist
from war against Ferrara. They refused to comply, and made preparations
to prosecute their design with greater vigor than they had hitherto
done; and having routed the forces of the duke and the marquis at
Argenta, they approached Ferrara so closely as to pitch their tents in
the marquis's park.

The League found they must no longer delay rendering him efficient
assistance, and ordered the duke of Calabria to march to Ferrara with
his forces and those of the pope, the Florentine troops also moving in
the same direction. In order to direct the operations of the war with
greater efficiency, the League assembled a diet at Cremona, which was
attended by the pope's legate, the Count Girolamo, the duke of Calabria,
the Signor Lodovico Sforza, and Lorenzo de' Medici, with many other
Italian princes; and when the measures to be adopted were fully
discussed, having decided that the best way of relieving Ferrara would
be to effect a division of the enemy's forces, the League desired
Lodovico to attack the Venetians on the side of Milan, but this he
declined, for fear of bringing a war upon the duke's territories, which
it would be difficult to quell. It was therefore resolved to proceed
with the united forces of the League to Ferrara, and having assembled
four thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry, they went in pursuit
of the Venetians, whose force amounted to two thousand two hundred
men at arms, and six thousand foot. They first attacked the Venetian
flotilla, then lying upon the river Po, which they routed with the loss
of above two hundred vessels, and took prisoner Antonio Justiniano, the
purveyor of the fleet. The Venetians, finding all Italy united against
them, endeavored to support their reputation by engaging in their
service the duke of Lorraine, who joined them with two hundred men at
arms: and having suffered so great a destruction of their fleet, they
sent him, with part of their army, to keep their enemies at bay, and
Roberto da San Severino to cross the Adda with the remainder, and
proceed to Milan, where they were to raise the cry of "The duke and the
Lady Bona," his mother; hoping by this means to give a new aspect to
affairs there, believing that Lodovico and his government were generally
unpopular. This attack at first created great consternation, and roused
the citizens in arms; but eventually produced consequences unfavorable
to the designs of the Venetians; for Lodovico was now desirous to
undertake what he had refused to do at the entreaty of his allies.
Leaving the marquis of Ferrara to the defense of his own territories,
he, with four thousand horse and two thousand foot, and joined by the
duke of Calabria with twelve thousand horse and five thousand foot,
entered the territory of Bergamo, then Brescia, next that of Verona,
and, in defiance of the Venetians, plundered the whole country; for it
was with the greatest difficulty that Roberto and his forces could
save the cities themselves. In the meantime, the marquis of Ferrara had
recovered a great part of his territories; for the duke of Lorraine, by
whom he was attacked, having only at his command two thousand horse and
one thousand foot, could not withstand him. Hence, during the whole of
1483, the affairs of the League were prosperous.

The winter having passed quietly over, the armies again took the field.
To produce the greater impression upon the enemy, the League united
their whole force, and would easily have deprived the Venetians of all
they possessed in Lombardy, if the war had been conducted in the same
manner as during the preceding year; for by the departure of the duke
of Lorraine, whose term of service had expired, they were reduced to
six thousand horse and five thousand foot, while the allies had thirteen
thousand horse and five thousand foot at their disposal. But, as is
often the case where several of equal authority are joined in command,
their want of unity decided the victory to their enemies. Federigo,
marquis of Mantua, whose influence kept the duke of Calabria and
Lodovico Sforza within bounds, being dead, differences arose between
them which soon became jealousies. Giovan Galeazzo, duke of Milan, was
now of an age to take the government on himself, and had married the
daughter of the duke of Calabria, who wished his son-in-law to exercise
the government and not Lodovico; the latter, being aware of the duke's
design, studied to prevent him from effecting it. The position of
Lodovico being known to the Venetians, they thought they could make it
available for their own interests; and hoped, as they had often before
done, to recover in peace all they had lost by war; and having secretly
entered into treaty with Lodovico, the terms were concluded in August,
1484. When this became known to the rest of the allies, they were
greatly dissatisfied, principally because they found that the places won
from the Venetians were to be restored; that they were allowed to
keep Rovigo and the Polesine, which they had taken from the marquis of
Ferrara, and besides this retain all the pre-eminence and authority over
Ferrara itself which they had formerly possessed. Thus it was evident
to everyone, they had been engaged in a war which had cost vast sums of
money, during the progress of which they had acquired honor, and which
was concluded with disgrace; for the places wrested from the enemy were
restored without themselves recovering those they had lost. They
were, however, compelled to ratify the treaty, on account of the
unsatisfactory state of their finances, and because the faults and
ambition of others had rendered them unwilling to put their fortunes to
further proof.



CHAPTER VI

Affairs of the pope--He is reconciled to Niccolo Vitelli--Discords
between the Colonnesi and the Orsini--Various events--The war
of Serezana--Genoa occupied by her archbishop--Death of Sixtus
IV.--Innocent VIII. elected--Agostino Fregoso gives Serezana to the bank
of St. Giorgio--Account of the bank of St. Giorgio--War with the
Genoese for Serezana--Stratagem of the Florentines to attack Pietra
Santa--Difficulties and final surrender of Pietra Santa--The Lucchese
lay claim to Pietra Santa--The city of L'Aquila revolts against the king
of Naples--War between him and the pope--The Florentines take the king's
party--Peace between the pope and the king.

During these events in Lombardy, the pope sent Lorenzo to invest Citta
di Castello, for the purpose of expelling Niccolo Vitelli, the place
having been abandoned to him by the League, for the purpose of inducing
the pontiff to join them. During the siege, Niccolo's troops were
led out against the papal forces and routed them. Upon this the pope
recalled the Count Girolamo from Lombardy with orders first to recruit
his army at Rome, and then proceed against Citta di Castello. But
thinking afterward, that it would be better to obtain Niccolo Vitello
as his friend than to renew hostilities with him, an arrangement was
entered into by which the latter retained Citta di Castello, and the
pope pacified Lorenzo as well as he could. He was induced to both these
measures rather by his apprehension of fresh troubles than by his love
of peace, for he perceived dissensions arising between the Colonessi and
the Orsini.

In the war between the king of Naples and the pope, the former had
taken the district of Tagliacozzo from the Orsini, and given it to the
Colonnesi, who had espoused his cause. Upon the establishment of peace,
the Orsini demanded its restoration by virtue of the treaty. The pope
had frequently intimated to the Colonnesi that it ought to be restored;
but they, instead of complying with the entreaties of the Orsini, or
being influenced by the pope's threats, renewed hostilities against the
former. Upon this the pontiff, unable to endure their insolence, united
his own forces with those of the Orsini, plundered the houses they
possessed in Rome, slew or made prisoners all who defended them, and
seized most of their fortresses. So that when these troubles were
composed, it was rather by the complete subjugation of one party than
from any desire for peace in the other.

Nor were the affairs of Genoa or of Tuscany in repose, for the
Florentines kept the Count Antonio da Marciano on the borders of
Serezana; and while the war continued in Lombardy, annoyed the people
of Serezana by inroads and light skirmishes. Battistino Fregoso, doge of
Genoa, trusting to Pagolo Fregoso, the archbishop, was taken prisoner,
with his wife and children, by the latter, who assumed the sovereignty
of the city. The Venetian fleet had attacked the kingdom of Naples,
taken Gallipoli, and harassed the neighboring places. But upon the peace
of Lombardy, all tumults were hushed except those of Tuscany and Rome;
for the pope died in five days after its declaration, either in the
natural course of things, or because his grief for peace, to which he
was always opposed, occasioned his end.

Upon the decease of the pontiff, Rome was immediately in arms. The Count
Girolamo withdrew his forces into the castle; and the Orsini feared the
Colonnesi would avenge the injuries they had recently sustained. The
Colonnesi demanded the restitution of their houses and castles, so that
in a few days robberies, fires, and murders prevailed in several parts
of the city. The cardinals entreated the count to give the castle into
the hands of the college, withdraw his troops, and deliver Rome from
the fear of his forces, and he, by way of ingratiating himself with the
future pontiff obeyed, and retired to Imola. The cardinals, being thus
divested of their fears, and the barons hopeless of assistance in their
quarrels, proceeded to create a new pontiff, and after some discussion,
Giovanni Batista Cibo, a Genoese, cardinal of Malfetta, was elected, and
took the name of Innocent VIII. By the mildness of his disposition (for
he was peaceable and humane) he caused a cessation of hostilities, and
for the present restored peace to Rome.

The Florentines, after the pacification of Lombardy, could not remain
quiet; for it appeared disgraceful that a private gentleman should
deprive them of the fortress of Serezana; and as it was allowed by the
conditions of peace, not only to demand lost places, but to make war
upon any who should impede their restoration, they immediately provided
men and money to undertake its recovery. Upon this, Agostino Fregoso,
who had seized Serezana, being unable to defend it, gave the fortress to
the Bank of St. Giorgio. As we shall have frequent occasion to speak of
St. Giorgio and the Genoese, it will not be improper, since Genoa is
one of the principal cities of Italy, to give some account of the
regulations and usages prevailing there. When the Genoese had made peace
with the Venetians, after the great war, many years ago, the republic,
being unable to satisfy the claims of those who had advanced large sums
of money for its use, conceded to them the revenue of the Dogano or
customhouse, so that each creditor should participate in the receipts
in proportion to his claim, until the whole amount should be liquidated,
and as a suitable place for their assembling, the palace over the
Dogano was assigned for their use. These creditors established a form of
government among themselves, appointing a council of one hundred persons
for the direction of their affairs, and a committee of eight, who, as
the executive body, should carry into effect the determinations of the
council. Their credits were divided into shares, called _Luoghi_, and
they took the title of the Bank, or Company of St. Giorgio. Having thus
arranged their government, the city fell into fresh difficulties, and
applied to San Giorgio for assistance, which, being wealthy and well
managed, was able to afford the required aid. On the other hand, as the
city had at first conceded the customs, she next began to assign towns,
castles, or territories, as security for moneys received; and this
practice has proceeded to such a length, from the necessities of the
state, and the accommodation by the San Giorgio, that the latter now
has under its administration most of the towns and cities in the Genoese
dominion. These the Bank governs and protects, and every year sends its
deputies, appointed by vote, without any interference on the part of the
republic. Hence the affections of the citizens are transferred from the
government to the San Giorgio, on account of the tyranny of the
former, and the excellent regulations adopted by the latter. Hence also
originate the frequent changes of the republic, which is sometimes
under a citizen, and at other times governed by a stranger; for the
magistracy, and not the San Giorgio, changes the government. So when
the Fregosi and the Adorni were in opposition, as the government of the
republic was the prize for which they strove, the greater part of the
citizens withdrew and left it to the victor. The only interference of
the Bank of St. Giorgio is when one party has obtained a superiority
over the other, to bind the victor to the observance of its laws, which
up to this time have not been changed; for as it possesses arms, money,
and influence, they could not be altered without incurring the imminent
risk of a dangerous rebellion. This establishment presents an
instance of what in all the republics, either described or imagined
by philosophers, has never been thought of; exhibiting within the same
community, and among the same citizens, liberty and tyranny, integrity
and corruption, justice and injustice; for this establishment preserves
in the city many ancient and venerable customs; and should it happen (as
in time it easily may) that the San Giorgio should have possession of
the whole city, the republic will become more distinguished than that of
Venice.

Agostino Fregoso conceded Serezana to the San Giorgio, which readily
accepted it, undertook its defense, put a fleet to sea, and sent forces
to Pietra Santa to prevent all attempts of the Florentines, whose
camp was in the immediate vicinity. The Florentines found it would be
essentially necessary to gain possession of Pietra Santa, for without
it the acquisition of Serezana lost much of its value, being situated
between the latter place and Pisa; but they could not, consistently
with the treaty, besiege it, unless the people of Pietra Santa, or its
garrison, were to impede their acquisition of Serezana. To induce the
enemy to do this, the Florentines sent from Pisa to the camp a quantity
of provisions and military stores, accompanied by a very weak escort;
that the people of Pietra Santa might have little cause for fear, and by
the richness of the booty be tempted to the attack. The plan succeeded
according to their expectation; for the inhabitants of Pietra Santa,
attracted by the rich prize took possession of it.

This gave legitimate occasion to the Florentines to undertake operations
against them; so leaving Serezana they encamped before Pietra Santa,
which was very populous, and made a gallant defense. The Florentines
planted their artillery in the plain, and formed a rampart upon the
hill, that they might also attack the place on that side. Jacopo
Guicciardini was commissary of the army; and while the siege of Pietra
Santa was going on, the Genoese took and burned the fortress of Vada,
and, landing their forces, plundered the surrounding country. Biongianni
Gianfigliazzi was sent against them, with a body of horse and foot, and
checked their audacity, so that they pursued their depredations less
boldly. The fleet continuing its efforts went to Livorno, and by
pontoons and other means approached the new tower, playing their
artillery upon it for several days, but being unable to make any
impression they withdrew.

In the meantime the Florentines proceeded slowly against Pietra Santa,
and the enemy taking courage attacked and took their works upon the
hill. This was effected with so much glory, and struck such a panic into
the Florentines, that they were almost ready to raise the siege, and
actually retreated a distance of four miles; for their generals thought
that they would retire to winter quarters, it being now October, and
make no further attempt till the return of spring.

When the discomfiture was known at Florence, the government was filled
with indignation; and, to impart fresh vigor to the enterprise, and
restore the reputation of their forces, they immediately appointed
Antonio Pucci and Bernardo del Neri commissaries, who, with vast sums of
money, proceeded to the army, and intimated the heavy displeasure of the
Signory, and of the whole city, if they did not return to the walls; and
what a disgrace, if so large an army and so many generals, having only
a small garrison to contend with, could not conquer so poor and weak
a place. They explained the immediate and future advantages that would
result from the acquisition, and spoke so forcibly upon the subject,
that all became anxious to renew the attack. They resolved, in the first
place, to recover the rampart upon the hill; and here it was evident how
greatly humanity, affability, and condescension influence the minds of
soldiers; for Antonio Pucci, by encouraging one and promising another,
shaking hands with this man and embracing that, induced them to proceed
to the charge with such impetuosity, that they gained possession of
the rampart in an instant. However, the victory was not unattended by
misfortune, for Count Antonio da Marciano was killed by a cannon shot.
This success filled the townspeople with so much terror, that they began
to make proposals for capitulation; and to invest the surrender with
imposing solemnity, Lorenzo de' Medici came to the camp, when, after a
few days, the fortress was given up. It being now winter, the leaders of
the expedition thought it unadvisable to make any further effort until
the return of spring, more particularly because the autumnal air had
been so unhealthy that numbers were affected by it. Antonio Pucci and
Biongianni Gianfigliazzi were taken ill and died, to the great regret
of all, so greatly had Antonio's conduct at Pietra Santa endeared him to
the army.

Upon the taking of Pietra Santa, the Lucchese sent ambassadors to
Florence, to demand its surrender to their republic, on account of its
having previously belonged to them, and because, as they alleged, it was
in the conditions that places taken by either party were to be restored
to their original possessors. The Florentines did not deny the articles,
but replied that they did not know whether, by the treaty between
themselves and the Genoese, which was then under discussion, it would
have to be given up or not, and therefore could not reply to that point
at present; but in case of its restitution, it would first be necessary
for the Lucchese to reimburse them for the expenses they had incurred
and the injury they had suffered, in the death of so many citizens; and
that when this was satisfactorily arranged, they might entertain hopes
of obtaining the place.

The whole winter was consumed in negotiations between the Florentines
and Genoese, which, by the pope's intervention, were carried on at Rome;
but not being concluded upon the return of spring, the Florentines would
have attacked Serezana had they not been prevented by the illness of
Lorenzo de' Medici, and the war between the pope and King Ferrando; for
Lorenzo was afflicted not only by the gout, which seemed hereditary in
his family, but also by violent pains in the stomach, and was compelled
to go the baths for relief.

The more important reason was furnished by the war, of which this was
the origin. The city of L'Aquila, though subject to the kingdom of
Naples, was in a manner free; and the Count di Montorio possessed great
influence over it. The duke of Calabria was upon the banks of the Tronto
with his men-at-arms, under pretense of appeasing some disturbances
among the peasantry; but really with a design of reducing L'Aquila
entirely under the king's authority, and sent for the Count di Montorio,
as if to consult him upon the business he pretended then to have in
hand. The count obeyed without the least suspicion, and on his arrival
was made prisoner by the duke and sent to Naples. When this circumstance
became known at L'Aquila, the anger of the inhabitants arose to the
highest pitch; taking arms they killed Antonio Cencinello, commissary
for the king, and with him some inhabitants known partisans of his
majesty. The L'Aquilani, in order to have a defender in their rebellion,
raised the banner of the church, and sent envoys to the pope, to submit
their city and themselves to him, beseeching that he would defend them
as his own subjects against the tyranny of the king. The pontiff gladly
undertook their defense, for he had both public and private reasons for
hating that monarch; and Signor Roberto of San Severino, an enemy of the
duke of Milan, being disengaged, was appointed to take the command
of his forces, and sent for with all speed to Rome. He entreated
the friends and relatives of the Count di Montorio to withdraw their
allegiance from the king, and induced the princes of Altimura, Salerno,
and Bisignano to take arms against him. The king, finding himself so
suddenly involved in war, had recourse to the Florentines and the duke
of Milan for assistance. The Florentines hesitated with regard to their
own conduct, for they felt all the inconvenience of neglecting their own
affairs to attend to those of others, and hostilities against the church
seemed likely to involve much risk. However, being under the obligation
of a League, they preferred their honor to convenience or security,
engaged the Orsini, and sent all their own forces under the Count
di Pitigliano toward Rome, to the assistance of the king. The latter
divided his forces into two parts; one, under the duke of Calabria, he
sent toward Rome, which, being joined by the Florentines, opposed the
army of the church; with the other, under his own command, he attacked
the barons, and the war was prosecuted with various success on both
sides. At length, the king, being universally victorious, peace was
concluded by the intervention of the ambassadors of the king of Spain,
in August, 1486, to which the pope consented; for having found fortune
opposed to him he was not disposed to tempt it further. In this treaty
all the powers of Italy were united, except the Genoese, who were
omitted as rebels against the republic of Milan, and unjust occupiers of
territories belonging to the Florentines. Upon the peace being ratified,
Roberto da San Severino, having been during the war a treacherous ally
of the church, and by no means formidable to her enemies, left Rome;
being followed by the forces of the duke and the Florentines, after
passing Cesena, found them near him, and urging his flight reached
Ravenna with less than a hundred horse. Of his forces, part were
received into the duke's service, and part were plundered by the
peasantry. The king, being reconciled with his barons, put to death
Jacopo Coppola and Antonello d'Aversa and their sons, for having, during
the war, betrayed his secrets to the pope.

The pope having observed in the course of the war, how promptly and
earnestly the Florentines adhered to their alliances, although he had
previously been opposed to them from his attachment to the Genoese,
and the assistance they had rendered to the king, now evinced a more
amicable disposition, and received their ambassadors with greater favor
than previously. Lorenzo de' Medici, being made acquainted with this
change of feeling, encouraged it with the utmost solicitude; for he
thought it would be of great advantage, if to the friendship of the king
he could add that of the pontiff. The pope had a son named Francesco,
upon whom designing to bestow states and attach friends who might be
useful to him after his own death, saw no safer connection in Italy
than Lorenzo's, and therefore induced the latter to give him one of his
daughters in marriage. Having formed this alliance, the pope desired the
Genoese to concede Serezana to the Florentines, insisting that they had
no right to detain what Agostino had sold, nor was Agostino justified
in making over to the Bank of San Giorgio what was not his own. However,
his holiness did not succeed with them; for the Genoese, during these
transactions at Rome, armed several vessels, and, unknown to the
Florentines, landed three thousand foot, attacked Serezanello, situated
above Serezana, plundered and burnt the town near it, and then,
directing their artillery against the fortress, fired upon it with their
utmost energy. This assault was new and unexpected by the Florentines,
who immediately assembled their forces under Virginio Orsino, at Pisa,
and complained to the pope, that while he was endeavoring to establish
peace, the Genoese had renewed their attack upon them. They then sent
Piero Corsini to Lucca, that by his presence he might keep the city
faithful; and Pagolantonio Soderini to Venice, to learn how that
republic was disposed. They demanded assistance of the king and of
Signor Lodovico, but obtained it from neither; for the king expressed
apprehensions of the Turkish fleet, and Lodovico made excuses, but sent
no aid. Thus the Florentines in their own wars are almost always
obliged to stand alone, and find no friends to assist them with the same
readiness they practice toward others. Nor did they, on this desertion
of their allies (it being nothing new to them) give way to despondency;
for having assembled a large army under Jacopo Guicciardini and Pietro
Vettori, they sent it against the enemy, who had encamped upon the
river Magra, at the same time pressing Serezanello with mines and every
species of attack. The commissaries being resolved to relieve the place,
an engagement ensued, when the Genoese were routed, and Lodovico dal
Fiesco, with several other principal men, made prisoners. The Serezanesi
were not so depressed at their defeat as to be willing to surrender,
but obstinately prepared for their defense, while the Florentine
commissaries proceeded with their operations, and instances of valor
occurred on both sides. The siege being protracted by a variety of
fortune, Lorenzo de' Medici resolved to go to the camp, and on his
arrival the troops acquired fresh courage, while that of the enemy
seemed to fail; for perceiving the obstinacy of the Florentines' attack,
and the delay of the Genoese in coming to their relief, they surrendered
to Lorenzo, without asking conditions, and none were treated with
severity except two or three who were leaders of the rebellion. During
the siege, Lodovico had sent troops to Pontremoli, as if with an
intention of assisting the Florentines; but having secret correspondence
in Genoa, a party was raised there, who, by the aid of these forces,
gave the city to the duke of Milan.

At this time the Dutch made war upon the Venetians, and Boccolino of
Osimo, in the Marca, caused that place to revolt from the pope, and
assumed the sovereignty. After a variety of fortune, he was induced to
restore the city to the pontiff and come to Florence, where, under the
protection of Lorenzo de' Medici, by whose advice he had been prevailed
upon to submit, he lived long and respected. He afterward went to Milan,
but did not experience such generous treatment; for Lodovico caused him
to be put to death. The Venetians were routed by the Dutch, near the
city of Trento, and Roberto da S. Severino, their captain, was slain.
After this defeat, the Venetians, with their usual good fortune, made
peace with the Dutch, not as vanquished, but as conquerors, so honorable
were the terms they obtained.

About this time, there arose serious troubles in Romagna. Francesco
d'Orso, of Furli, was a man of great authority in that city, and
became suspected by the count Girolamo, who often threatened him. He
consequently, living under great apprehensions, was advised by his
friends to provide for his own safety, by the immediate adoption of such
a course as would relieve him from all further fear of the count. Having
considered the matter and resolved to attempt it, they fixed upon the
market day, at Furli, as most suitable for their purpose; for many of
their friends being sure to come from the country, they might make
use of their services without having to bring them expressly for the
occasion. It was the month of May, when most Italians take supper by
daylight. The conspirators thought the most convenient hour would be
after the count had finished his repast; for his household being then
at their meal, he would remain in the chamber almost alone. Having
fixed upon the hour, Francesco went to the count's residence, left
his companions in the hall, proceeded to his apartment, and desired an
attendant to say he wished for an interview. He was admitted, and after
a few words of pretended communication, slew him, and calling to his
associates, killed the attendant. The governor of the place coming by
accident to speak with the count, and entering the apartment with a few
of his people, was also slain. After this slaughter, and in the midst
of a great tumult, the count's body was thrown from the window, and with
the cry of "church and liberty," they roused the people (who hated the
avarice and cruelty of the count) to arms, and having plundered his
house, made the Countess Caterina and her children prisoners. The
fortress alone had to be taken to bring the enterprise to a successful
issue; but the Castellan would not consent to its surrender. They begged
the countess would desire him to comply with their wish, which she
promised to do, if they would allow her to go into the fortress,
leaving her children as security for the performance of her promise. The
conspirators trusted her, and permitted her to enter; but as soon as she
was within, she threatened them with death and every kind of torture in
revenge for the murder of her husband; and upon their menacing her with
the death of her children, she said she had the means of getting more.
Finding they were not supported by the pope, and that Lodovico
Sforza, uncle to the countess, had sent forces to her assistance, the
conspirators became terrified, and taking with them whatever property
they could carry off, they fled to Citta di Castello. The countess
recovered the state, and avenged the death of her husband with the
utmost cruelty. The Florentines hearing of the count's death, took
occasion to recover the fortress of Piancaldoli, of which he had
formerly deprived them, and, on sending some forces, captured it; but
Cecco, the famous engineer, lost his life during the siege.

To this disturbance in Romagna, another in that province, no less
important, has to be added. Galeotto, lord of Faenza, had married the
daughter of Giovanni Bentivogli, prince of Bologna. She, either through
jealousy or ill treatment by her husband, or from the depravity of her
own nature, hated him to such a degree, that she determined to deprive
him of his possessions and his life; and pretending sickness, she took
to her bed, where, having induced Galeotto to visit her, he was slain by
assassins, whom she had concealed for that purpose in the apartment.
She had acquainted her father with her design, and he hoped, on his
son-in-law's death, to become lord of Faenza. A great tumult arose as
soon as the murder was known, the widow, with an infant son, fled into
the fortress, the people took up arms, Giovanni Bentivogli, with a
condottiere of the duke of Milan, named Bergamino, engaged for the
occasion, entered Faenza with a considerable force, and Antonio Boscoli,
the Florentine commissary, was also there. These leaders being together,
and discoursing of the government of the place, the men of Val di
Lamona, who had risen unanimously upon learning what had occurred,
attacked Giovanni and Bergamino, the latter of whom they slew, made the
former prisoner, and raising the cry of "Astorre and the Florentines,"
offered the city to the commissary. These events being known at
Florence, gave general offense; however, they set Giovanni and his
daughter at liberty, and by the universal desire of the people, took
the city and Astorre under their protection. Besides these, after
the principal differences of the greater powers were composed, during
several years tumults prevailed in Romagna, the Marca, and Sienna,
which, as they are unimportant, it will be needless to recount. When
the duke of Calabria, after the war of 1478, had left the country, the
distractions of Sienna became more frequent, and after many changes, in
which, first the plebeians, and then the nobility, were victorious, the
latter and length maintained the superiority, and among them Pandolfo
and Jacopo Petrucci obtained the greatest influence, so that the former
being distinguished for prudence and the latter for resolution, they
became almost princes in the city.

The Florentines after the war of Serezana, lived in great prosperity
until 1492, when Lorenzo de' Medici died; for he having put a stop to
the internal wars of Italy, and by his wisdom and authority established
peace, turned his thoughts to the advancement of his own and the city's
interests, and married Piero, his eldest son, to Alfonsina, daughter of
the Cavaliere Orsino. He caused Giovanni, his second son, to be raised
to the dignity of cardinal. This was the more remarkable from its being
unprecedented; for he was only fourteen years of age when admitted to
the college; and became the medium by which his family attained to the
highest earthly glory. He was unable to make any particular provision
for Guiliano, his third son, on account of his tender years, and
the shortness of his own life. Of his daughters, one married Jacopo
Salviati; another, Francesco Cibo; the third, Piero Ridolfi; and the
fourth, whom, in order to keep his house united, he had married to
Giovanni de' Medici, died. In his commercial affairs he was very
unfortunate, from the improper conduct of his agents, who in all their
proceedings assumed the deportment of princes rather than of private
persons; so that in many places, much of his property was wasted, and
he had to be relieved by his country with large sums of money. To
avoid similar inconvenience, he withdrew from mercantile pursuits,
and invested his property in land and houses, as being less liable to
vicissitude. In the districts of Prato, Pisa, and the Val di Pesa, he
purchased extensively, and erected buildings, which for magnificence
and utility, were quite of regal character. He next undertook the
improvement of the city, and as many parts were unoccupied by buildings,
he caused new streets to be erected in them, of great beauty, and thus
enlarged the accommodation of the inhabitants. To enjoy his power in
security and repose, and conquer or resist his enemies at a distance, in
the direction of Bologna he fortified the castle of Firenzuola,
situated in the midst of the Appennines; toward Sienna he commenced the
restoration and fortification of the Poggio Imperiale; and he shut out
the enemy in the direction of Genoa, by the acquisition of Pietra Santa
and Serezana. For the greater safety of the city, he kept in pay the
Baglioni, at Perugia, and the Vitelli, at Citta di Castello, and held
the government of Faenza wholly in his own power; all which greatly
contributed to the repose and prosperity of Florence. In peaceful times,
he frequently entertained the people with feasts, and exhibitions of
various events and triumphs of antiquity; his object being to keep the
city abundantly supplied, the people united, and the nobility honored.
He was a great admirer of excellence in the arts, and a patron of
literary men, of which Agnolo da Montepulciano, Cristofero Landini, and
Demetrius Chalcondylas, a Greek, may afford sufficient proofs. On this
account, Count Giovanni della Mirandola, a man of almost supernatural
genius, after visiting every court of Europe, induced by the munificence
of Lorenzo, established his abode at Florence. He took great delight
in architecture, music, and poetry, many of his comments and poetical
compositions still remaining. To facilitate the study of literature
to the youth of Florence, he opened a university at Pisa, which was
conducted by the most distinguished men in Italy. For Mariano da
Chinazano, a friar of the order of St. Augustine, and an excellent
preacher, he built a monastery in the neighborhood of Florence. He
enjoyed much favor both from fortune and from the Almighty; all his
enterprises were brought to a prosperous termination, while his enemies
were unfortunate; for, besides the conspiracy of the Pazzi, an attempt
was made to murder him in the Carmine, by Batista Frescobaldi, and a
similar one by Baldinetto da Pistoja, at his villa; but these persons,
with their confederates, came to the end their crimes deserved. His
skill, prudence, and fortune, were acknowledged with admiration, not
only by the princes of Italy, but by those of distant countries; for
Matthias, king of Hungary, gave him many proofs of his regard; the
sultan sent ambassadors to him with valuable presents, and the Turkish
emperor placed in his hands Bernardo Bandini, the murderer of his
brother. These circumstances raised his fame throughout Italy, and his
reputation for prudence constantly increased; for in council he was
eloquent and acute, wise in determination, and prompt and resolute
in execution. Nor can vices be alleged against him to sully so many
virtues; though he was fond of women, pleased with the company of
facetious and satirical men, and amused with the games of the nursery,
more than seemed consistent with so great a character; for he was
frequently seen playing with his children, and partaking of their
infantine sports; so that whoever considers this gravity and
cheerfulness, will find united in him dispositions which seem almost
incompatible with each other. In his later years, he was greatly
afflicted; besides the gout, he was troubled with excruciating pains in
the stomach, of which he died in April, 1492, in the forty-fourth year
of his age; nor was there ever in Florence, or even in Italy, one so
celebrated for wisdom, or for whose loss such universal regret was felt.
As from his death the greatest devastation would shortly ensue, the
heavens gave many evident tokens of its approach; among other signs,
the highest pinnacle of the church of Santa Reparata was struck with
lightning, and great part of it thrown down, to the terror and amazement
of everyone. The citizens and all the princes of Italy mourned for him,
and sent their ambassadors to Florence, to condole with the city on the
occasion; and the justness of their grief was shortly after apparent;
for being deprived of his counsel, his survivors were unable either to
satisfy or restrain the ambition of Lodovico Sforza, tutor to the duke
of Milan; and hence, soon after the death of Lorenzo, those evil plants
began to germinate, which in a little time ruined Italy, and continue to
keep her in desolation.

electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
