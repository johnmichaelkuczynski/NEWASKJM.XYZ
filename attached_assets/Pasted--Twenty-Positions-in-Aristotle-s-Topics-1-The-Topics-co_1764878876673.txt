**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Topics***

1. The **Topics** concerns dialectical reasoning—syllogisms from reputable opinions (endoxa), not from necessary truths as in demonstration.

2. **Dialectic** is useful for training, for conversation with the many, and for philosophical sciences (by revealing aporiai and first principles).

3. A **dialectical proposition** is one that seems true to all, to most, or to the wise (and among the wise, to all, most, or the most notable).

4. A **problem** is a thesis about which people either hold no opinion, or the many disagree with the wise, or there is disagreement within either group.

5. Every dialectical proposition and problem concerns one of **four predicables**: definition, genus, proprium (unique property), or accident.

6. A **definition** states the essence and is convertible with its subject—it applies to all and only instances of the definiendum.

7. A **genus** is predicated essentially of many things differing in species—it says what the subject is but not uniquely.

8. A **proprium** is not the essence but belongs to only that species and is convertible with it (e.g., capable of learning grammar / man).

9. An **accident** is what may belong or not belong to the same subject—it is neither definition, genus, nor proprium.

10. The dialectician must collect **topoi (commonplaces)**—general argumentative strategies applicable across subject matters.

11. Topoi are organized according to which predicable is at issue: there are topoi for attacking or establishing definitions, genera, propria, and accidents.

12. **Topoi for definition** include: checking if the definition fails to be convertible, if it is obscure, if it uses metaphor, if it is circular, if it fails to state the genus.

13. **Topoi for genus** include: checking if the proposed genus is not predicated in the "what is it" category, if something participates in the genus but not the species.

14. **Topoi for proprium** include: checking if the property fails to hold of all instances, if it is not convertible, if it holds only sometimes.

15. **Topoi for accident** include: examining opposites, correlatives, coordinates, and inflections to find inconsistencies.

16. **Induction** is the progression from particulars to universals and is more persuasive to the many; **syllogism** moves from universals and is more compelling to dialecticians.

17. The questioner's goal is to extract concessions that yield a contradictory conclusion to the answerer's thesis; the answerer's goal is to avoid contradiction.

18. One should distinguish **multiple senses of a term** (homonymy) before proceeding—ambiguity is a source of fallacious refutation.

19. **Dialectical practice** requires knowing not just the topoi but when and how to deploy them—order, timing, and concealment matter.

20. Dialectic is **propaedeutic to first philosophy**: by thoroughly examining aporiai from all sides, dialectic clears the path toward grasping the first principles that nous ultimately apprehends.
