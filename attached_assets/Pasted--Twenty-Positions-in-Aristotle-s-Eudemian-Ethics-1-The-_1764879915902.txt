**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Eudemian Ethics***

1. The *Eudemian Ethics* is an **independent ethical treatise**, not merely a draft of the Nicomachean—it has its own distinctive emphases and arguments.

2. **Eudaimonia is the highest good**—it is the end for the sake of which everything else is done, and it consists in living well and acting well.

3. Eudaimonia requires specifying **what kind of life is best**—the life of virtue, the life of practical wisdom, or the life of contemplation.

4. The **noble (to kalon)** plays a more prominent role here than in the Nicomachean Ethics—virtuous action aims at the noble as its proper end.

5. **Virtue is a mean** relative to us, lying between excess and deficiency—this doctrine appears in both treatises but with different emphases.

6. The **three lives** traditionally proposed as best are the political, philosophical, and pleasure-seeking—only the first two are serious candidates.

7. **Goods are of three kinds**: external goods, goods of the soul, and goods of the body—goods of the soul (virtues) are most authoritative.

8. **Good fortune (eutuchia)** differs from happiness—it provides external conditions but is not itself the good we achieve through our own activity.

9. Some people seem **naturally fortunate**—Aristotle puzzles over whether this is divine favor, natural temperament, or mere chance.

10. **Deliberation concerns means, not ends**—we wish for ends and deliberate about how to achieve them; choice is deliberate desire for what is in our power.

11. **Prohairesis (choice)** is central to moral responsibility—actions are voluntary when they proceed from choice based on deliberation.

12. The **particular virtues** are analyzed similarly to the Nicomachean treatment—courage, temperance, gentleness, liberality, and others as means between extremes.

13. Three books of the *Eudemian Ethics* are **shared with the Nicomachean** (on justice, intellectual virtues, and friendship)—scholars dispute which treatise they originally belonged to.

14. **Justice** is both a complete virtue (general justice) and a specific virtue concerning fair shares and rectification.

15. **Friendship (philia)** is extensively analyzed—its species, its relation to self-love, its necessity for the good life.

16. The person of **practical wisdom (phronimos)** is the standard of right action—what the wise person would judge to be the mean defines virtue.

17. **Kalokagathia (nobility-and-goodness)** is the comprehensive virtue—the unity of all particular virtues in a harmonious, noble character.

18. The **kalokagathic person** possesses all virtues and uses external goods rightly—wealth, beauty, and honor are pursued for the sake of noble action.

19. The Eudemian Ethics concludes with **contemplation of god** as the proper standard—the best life is ordered toward the service and contemplation of the divine.

20. Whatever promotes **contemplation of god** is best; whatever hinders it is bad—this theological framing of the human good is more explicit here than in the Nicomachean Ethics.
