**PART 2: IN THIS WORLD**

**The Committee**

Professor Sarah Chen stared at the email summoning her to the Academic Integrity Review Board. Her graduate student, Marcus, had submitted identical papers in two different courses—word for word, including the bibliography. Sarah had reported it, expecting a standard plagiarism hearing.

The conference room smelled of stale coffee and institutional carpet. Board chair Dr. Williams shuffled through papers while three other faculty members avoided eye contact.

"Professor Chen, thank you for coming," Dr. Williams began. "We've reviewed Marcus's case through our Cultural Context Framework. We need to understand your perspective on academic integrity expectations."

Sarah blinked. "My perspective? He submitted the same paper twice. That's self-plagiarism."

"Well, that's one interpretation," said Dr. Martinez from Sociology. "But Marcus comes from a collectivist culture where knowledge sharing is valued differently. Who are we to impose Western notions of individual intellectual property?"

"He's been here three years," Sarah said. "He knows the rules."

Dr. Williams leaned forward. "Sarah, rules themselves can be culturally biased constructs. Our new guidelines require us to consider diverse ethical frameworks before making judgments."

The room fell silent. Sarah looked around the table. "So what's the decision?"

"Marcus will attend six Cultural Academic Transition sessions," Dr. Williams announced. "He'll explore how different traditions approach scholarly work. No sanctions."

"What about the students who didn't cheat? What message does this send?"

Dr. Patel from Philosophy spoke up. "The concept of 'cheating' assumes universal moral standards. That's philosophically problematic in our diverse academic community."

Sarah stood up. "This is insane. You're not avoiding bias—you're avoiding making any judgment at all."

"We prefer 'culturally responsive,'" Dr. Williams corrected.

Two weeks later, Sarah received another email. A group of students had complained that her organic chemistry exams were "culturally exclusive" because they required specific right and wrong answers. The Dean of Inclusive Excellence wanted to meet.

Dean Rodriguez's office was decorated with flags from forty-seven countries. "Sarah, we need to discuss your assessment methods. Several students feel your emphasis on correct molecular structures reflects Western scientific hegemony."

"Chemistry isn't cultural," Sarah said flatly. "Benzene has six carbon atoms everywhere in the world."

"But how we teach and test chemistry can exclude different ways of knowing," the Dean replied. "We're implementing holistic evaluation methods that honor diverse approaches to scientific understanding."

Sarah watched her career crumble in real time. "You want me to accept wrong answers because correcting them might be culturally insensitive."

"We want you to expand your definition of correctness."

That evening, Sarah cleaned out her office. Twenty-three years of research, gone. In the hallway, she passed Marcus, who nodded politely. He was heading to his Cultural Academic Transition session, where he'd spend an hour discussing how plagiarism was really just a Western construct.

The security guard checking Sarah's boxes was sympathetic. "Another one leaving?" he asked.

"Another one," she confirmed.

He'd seen forty-seven faculty members leave in two years. The university called it "natural turnover." Sarah called it institutional suicide disguised as moral sophistication.

The parking lot was dark. Sarah loaded her boxes, knowing she'd never teach again.
