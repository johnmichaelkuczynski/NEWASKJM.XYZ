**Twenty Positions in Aristotle's *Meteorology***

1. **Meteorology studies phenomena in the region between the heavens and the earth**—occurrences in the upper atmosphere and related terrestrial phenomena.

2. These phenomena are caused by **two exhalations** rising from the earth: one hot and dry (smoky/vaporous), the other wet and cold (moist/steamy).

3. The **dry exhalation** is responsible for winds, thunder, lightning, and various fiery phenomena in the upper atmosphere.

4. The **moist exhalation** is responsible for clouds, rain, dew, frost, snow, and hail.

5. The **region below the moon** is filled with these exhalations, which are continuously drawn up by the sun's heat.

6. **Comets and the Milky Way** are not celestial phenomena but atmospheric—they are ignitions of the dry exhalation in the upper air.

7. **Shooting stars and meteors** are likewise combustions of dry exhalation, not objects falling from the heavens.

8. The **heat of the sun** is the primary efficient cause of meteorological phenomena—it drives the evaporative cycle.

9. **Winds** are horizontal movements of the dry exhalation; their direction and character depend on geographical and seasonal factors.

10. **Thunder** is the sound produced when dry exhalation trapped in clouds is violently expelled; **lightning** is its ignition.

11. Lightning is perceived before thunder because **sight is faster than hearing**—both occur simultaneously but are perceived successively.

12. **Rain** forms when moist exhalation rises, cools, condenses into clouds, and the droplets coalesce until heavy enough to fall.

13. **Snow** is frozen cloud; **frost** is frozen dew; **hail** forms when rain freezes during rapid descent through cold air.

14. **Rivers and springs** originate from condensation within the earth and from rainwater collected in subterranean reservoirs—not from inexhaustible underground seas.

15. The **sea is salty** because the dry, earthy exhalation mixes with water; evaporation removes fresh water, leaving salt concentrated.

16. The **sea's level remains constant** because evaporation balances inflow—it neither increases indefinitely nor dries up.

17. **Earthquakes** are caused by dry exhalation trapped underground seeking release—the earth shakes as the pneuma bursts forth.

18. **Geological change** occurs over vast time scales—seas become land, land becomes sea, but so slowly that it escapes historical memory.

19. **Rainbows, halos, and mock suns** are optical phenomena produced by reflection of light from moisture in the air under specific geometric conditions.

20. The rainbow displays a **fixed order of colors** and appears at a specific angle relative to sun and observer—Aristotle attempts a geometrical explanation of its arc and coloration.
