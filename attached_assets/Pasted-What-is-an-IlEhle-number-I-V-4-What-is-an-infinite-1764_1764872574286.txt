                        Finite numbers as inductive numbers

  A cardinal number is the number of elements of a class. Thus, the cardinalnumber of K={Larry, Moe, Curly} is three. In other words, [K]=3.

  A finite cardinal is an inductive cardinal, and a transfinite (or infinite)

cardinal is a non-inductive cardinal.

  Explanation: Let ℕ be the smallest class that contains 0 and that contains

n+1 whenever it contains n. In others words, n∈ℕ smallest class that

contains 0 and that contains n+1 whenever it contains n. In that case, n∈ℕ

(read: n is an element of ℕ) just in case either n=0 or n=m+1, where m is an

arbitrary element of ℕ.

  Thus, for any finite number n, there is some object X and some operation

O such that, if one starts with X, one need only apply O a finite number of

times, possibly zero times, to generate X.




                    Transfinite numbers as non-inductive numbers

  Question: Is the cardinal number of ℕ finite?

  No: Let ℵ be the cardinal number of ℕ. If one starts with 0 and applies
            0

+1a finite number of times, one will not reach ℵ.  Thus, ℵis transfinite by
 00 

virtue of being non-inductive. In general, a transfinite cardinal is a non-

inductive cardinal.




              Transfinite numbers as the numbers of reflexive classes

  There is a second way of defining of “transfinite number”: A transfinite

number is the number of a reflexive class.

  A class K is reflexive iff (read: if and only if) K can be bijected with a proper

subset of itself. K can be bijected with K* iff there one-one (read: one to

one) function from the one class to the other, i.e. if there is a function ϕ

such that ϕ assigns at least one element of K* to any given element of K and

such that ϕ never assigns the same element of K* to more than element of

K.  

ℕ can be bijected with a proper subset of itself.

  First example: Let ℕ be the class of all even numbers, i.e. let ℕ be the
                          22

class of all elements of ℕ that are divisible by 2. The function F(x)=2x bijectsℕ and ℕ.
        2

  Second example: Let ℕ be the class of all prime numbers. The function
                            P 

P(x) bijects ℕ and ℕ, where P(x) assigns 1 to 1 and, for any n>1, assigns the
                      P

smallest prime p≥n that has not already been assigned.




                            Two conceptions of class-size

  Question: What does it mean to say that two class K and K* have the

same number of elements? In other words, under what circumstances is it

the case that [K]=[K*]?

    There are two distinct but equally legitimate answers to this question:

  Answer #1: [K]=[K*] iff K≈K*. In other words, the number of elements in

K is the same as number of elements in K* iff K can be bijected with K*.
1

  Answer #2: [K]=[K*] iff

  (i) K≈K*,

  (ii) Neither class is identical with, or capable of being bijected with, any

class that is a proper subset of the other.

  Explanation of Answer #1: Let K be the number of forks that you have,

and let K* be the number of spoons that you have. [K]=[K*] iff K≈K*.  

  Problem with Answer #1: There is presumably some sense in which K
                                                                                    2

(the class of even numbers) has fewer elements than ℕ, and there is

presumably some sense in which KP (the class of primes) has fewer

elements than ℕ. In general, if K⊂K*---i.e. if K is a proper subset of K*,

meaning that every element of K is an element of K* but not vice versa---

then [K]<[K*].

    Hence Answer #2, according to which

  (a) K≈K*

is necessary but not sufficient for

  (b) [K]=[K*],

it also being necessary that       (c) For any class K#, if either K or K* can be bijected with K#, then

  neither K nor K* is a proper subset of K#.

  Answer #2 is generally accepted, and Answer #3 is generally rejected. In

what follows, we will assume the truth of Answer #2.

                              Three orders of Magnitude

  An order of magnitude is not a specific magnitude, but is rather a range of

magnitudes that are mathematically similar in some important respect.

  For the purposes of set-theory, this being the study of class-size, there

are ultimately three orders of magnitude:

      (i) Finite,

      (ii) Infinite and recursive, and

      (iii) Infinite and non-recursive.

      Given a class K, [K] is finite if there is some n such that

      (a) n∈ℕ, and

      (b) [K]=n.

      [K] is infinite and recursive iff [K]=ℵ. In other words, [K] is
                                                0

denumerable iff K is recursively definable.

      K is recursively definable iff, for some object α and some function ϕ,

x∈K iff 

        (i) x= α or

      (ii) x=ϕ(β), where β∈K.


  In other words, K is recursive iff, for some object α and some function ϕ K

is the posterity of  α with respect to ϕ.

  Proposition: If each of K and K* is recursively definable, then [K]=[K*].

  Proof: Being recursively definable, each class is the posterity of α with

respect to ϕ, for some object α and some operation ϕ, and that class may

therefore be bijected with ℕ by associating

  (A) α with 0 and

  (B) ϕ(x) with n+1, whenever x is associated with n.

  Given that any two classes that can be bijected with a third class can bebijected with each other, it follows that K≈K*.

  Let ℤ be the class of signed integers. +3 and -4 are signed integers. In

general, if n is an integer, then +n and -n are signed integers.

  Proposition: [ℤ]=[ℕ]. Proof: ϕ bijects ℕ and ℤ, where

  (i) ϕ(0)=−1,

  (ii) ϕ(n+1)=+n whenever  ϕ(n)=−n, and   

  (iii) ϕ(n+1)=−n whenever  ϕ(n)=+n.

  ϕ assigns −1 to 0, +1 to 1, −2 to 2, +2, to 3, and so on.

  Thus, [ℤ]=ℵ=[ℕ]. Q.E.D.
                0

  Let ℚ be the class of rational numbers, a rational number being one of

the form m/n, where each of m and n is an integer. Proposition: ℚ is

recursive. Proof:  Given two rationals a/b and c/d, put a/b before c/d if

a+b<c+d and put c/d before a/b if a+b>c+d. If a+b=c+d, put a/b before b/c if

a+b<c+d; otherwise, put c/d before a/b. Thisgives us the following series:
 

  1/1, ½, 2/1, 1/3, 2/2, 3/1, ¼, 2/3, 3/2, 4/1, 1/5, 2/4, 3/3, 4/2, 5/1,…

  There is no rational that does not occur in this series. Define a function ϕ

such that ϕ(1)=1/1 and such that, if ϕ(n) is the nth member of the above

series, then ϕ(n+1) is the member following the nth member. ϕ recursively

defines ℚ, and in so doing it bijects ℕ and ℚ. Thus [ℕ]=[ℚ]=ℵ. Q.E.D.
                                                                        0




                              Series, Sequences, and Limits

      A series is a class whose elements have been ordered.  In other words,

a series is a class each of whose elements has been associated with a

number and no two of whose elements have been assigned the number.

Thus, the series

    1, 2, 3, 4,…

is identical with class whose elements are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), etc., and the

series

    0, 1, 2, 3,…is identical with the class whose elements (0,1), (1,2), (3,3), (3,4), etc.

      This last series is defined by the ordered pair (ℕ, <), the first element of

corresponds to the elements being ordered and second element of which

corresponds to the relevant ordering-relation.

      A sequence is a discrete series. A discrete series is one each of whose

elements has an immediate successor. Thus, (ℕ, <) is a sequence.  A series

that is not discrete is compact. Thus, (ℚ, <) is a compact series, and so is (ℝ,

<).

    Given a class K, the elements of K can be arranged in a sequence just in

case K is either finite or infinite but recursive.

      A continuous series is a compact series that contains each of its own

limits.  Let S be a series or series-segment and let R be corresponding

ordering-relation. In that case, L is a limit of S just in case

  (i) Any given element of S bears R to L,

  (ii) L does not bear R to any element of S, and

  (iii) There is no non-element N of S such that N bears R to L.

  For example, if ℚ is the class of all elements of ℚ whose squares are
                      √2

less than 2, then √2 is the limit of (ℚ,<).
                                          √2

  Another example: If ℚis the series ½, ¾, 7/8, 15/16,…then the limit of
                            1 

ℚis 1.
1 

  √2 is not an element of ℚ, and √2 therefore doesn’t belong to (ℚ, <).

Many of the limiting points of (ℚ, <) do not belong to (ℚ, <). For this reason,

(ℚ, <) is not continuous even though it is compact.  By contract, (ℝ, <) is

both compact and continuous.

  All continuous series are compact, but not vice versa.

                                          [ℝ]>[ℕ]


  Proposition: ℝ is both infinite and non-recursive, i.e. ℝ is non-

denumerable.

  Proof: Let S be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers, each of which is

expressed as a non-repeating decimal. Define a function D(S) such that if n is

the figure in the nth decimal place in the nth member of S, then D(S)replaces n with n+1 if n<9 and D(L) replaces n with 1 if n=9. D(S) generates a

number N such that, for each n, the figure in the nth decimal place in N is

different from the figure in the nth decimal place in the nth member of S.

Given that any series of figures defines a real number, it follows that there is

no sequence of real numbers that contains every real number. Equivalently,

there is no recursive definition of ℝ. Q.E.D. 

  It follows that [ℝ]>[ℚ]. Given that [ℚ]=[ℕ] and that [ℕ]= ℵ, it follows
                                                                        0

that [ℝ]>ℵ. It also follows---though the requisite proof falls outside the
          0

scope of this monograph---that (ℝ, <) contains each of its own limiting

points. (The proof is stated in my book Mathematical Logic and Formal

Arithmetic: Part 1.)

                            Enumerable vs. Non-denumerable

  To enumerate is to count. It is always the elements of classes that are

counted. In other words, to count is to determine a class-size, when you

count your socks, you are counting the elements of k, this being the class of

your socks.

      An enumeration of a class k is a function that bijects the elements of k

with those of with an initial segment (a segment that includes 0 and that

includes n whenever it includes n+1) of (ℕ, <), this being the series 0, 1, 2, 3,

…If [k]=[ℕ], then the initial segment in question is an improper one.

      If [k]>[ℕ], then k cannot be enumerated, i.e. it is non-denumerable. ℝ is

non-denumerable, as previously proved.

                                The Power-set Theorem

  Proposition: For any K, whether finite or infinite, [PK]>[K]. Proof: Assume

arguendo that [PK]=[K]. In that case, there is a function ϕ from K to PK that

bijects those two classes. Define a subset k of K such that, if x is an arbitrary

element of K, then x∈k iff x∉ϕ(x). Let α be an element of K such that ϕ(α)=k.

If α∈k, then α∉ϕ(α); and if α∉ϕ(α), then α∉k. Therefore, α∈k iff α∉k.

Therefore, there is no α such that ϕ(α)=k. Therefore, contrary to our

assumption, there is no function ϕ such that ϕ bijects K and PK. Therefore,

[PK] ≠[K]. Given that, for each element x of K, there is a corresponding

element {x} of PK, it follows that PK is at least as large as K. Therefore, giventhat [PK]≠[K], it follows that [PK]>[K]. Q.E.D.

                                                  [K]
                                          [PK]=2

  Let ∅ be the empty set, i.e. the set that has no members. There is only

such set. This is because K and K* are different sets only if one them has

some member not had by the other. If K and K* are empty sets, neither has

any members not had by the other; wherefore, K and K* are not different

sets.

  Given a class K, let PK is the power-set of K, meaning that PK is the set of

all subsets of K.

  Proposition: Given any class K, ∅ is an element of PK. Proof: A class C is a

subset of a class C* just in case there is no element C that is not also an

element of C*. Given that ∅ has no elements, it follows that ∅ has no

elements that it does not share with K. Therefore, ∅ is a subset of K, for any

K.

                                                                    [K]
  Proposition: For any K, whether finite or infinite, [PK]=2. Proof by

                                                                [K]
induction:  First, prove that if [K]=0. In that case, [PK]=2=1. Proof: Let

K=∅.Given that ∅ is a subset of any given class, it follows that ∅ is a subset of

∅. Given that ∅ has no members, it follows that ∅ is the only subset of ∅.

                                    0[K]
Therefore, [P∅]=1. Given that n=1, for any n, it follows that if 2=1, when

                                                              [PK]+1
[K]=0.  If [K]=n and [K*]=[K]+1, then [PK*]=2×[PK]=2. Next, prove that,

                                  n
for any n, if [K]=n, then [PK]=2. Proof: Assume that [K*]=[K]+1. In that case,

there is some α such that K*=K∪α. Therefore, for each element k of PK,

there is exactly one element of k* of PK such that k*=k∪α. Therefore,

                  [K][K]+10
[PK*]=2×[PK]=2×2=2. Therefore, if [K]=0, [PK]=2=1, and, for any n>0,

                n[K]
if [K]=n, [PK]=2. Therefore, for any n, [PK]=2. Q.E.D.

                                                                                [K]
  It follows that for any class K, whether finite or transfinite, [PK]=2
                                                                                  .




                                              Orders of Infinity

                        [K]
 Given that [PK]=2>[K], for any K, whether finite or infinite, it follows

that there are infinitely many transfinites and, therefore, infinitely many

orders of infinity.   [ℝ]>[ℕ]. (Already proved.) [ℕ]=ℵ. (This is a matter of definition.) ℵ=
                                        DF 01

DF The smallest transfinite greater than ℵ0. This much is known.

                                            [K]

                                        1.

  The Continuum Hypothesis is the position that [ℝ]=[Pℕ]=ℵ.
                                                                        1

  The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis is position that, for any infinitely

large class K, [PK] is the smallest number that is greater than [K].




                                    Cardinal Arithmetic

  In order to understand the arithmetic of transfinites, we must

understand the arithmetic of finites. 

  The meaning of 2+3=3 is the union of a two-membered class with a non-

overlapping three-membered class is a six-membered class.

In general, A+B=C is the union of an A-membered class and a non-

overlapping B-membered class is a C-membered class.

  The meaning of 2×3=6 is the Cartesian Product of a two-membered class

and a three-membered class is a six-membered class.  (For obvious reasons,

it does not matter whether or not the classes in question overlap.) In

general, the meaning of A×B=C is the Cartesian Product of an A-membered

class and a B-membered class is a C-membered class.

                              3
  Finally, the meaning of 2=8  is there are eight selections from a three-

membered class of two-membered classes, meaning that  there are eight

different classes K# such that

(a) K# has exactly one element in common with each element of K and

(b) K# has no members that do not belong to K.

      Explanation: Let K be the smallest class whose members are: {a,b}, {c,d},

{e,f}. In that case, K# is the smallest class whose members are:

{a, c, e}

{a, c, f}

{a, d, e}{a, d, f}

{b, c, e}

{b, c, f}

{b, d, e}

{b, d, f}.

                                    B
       In general, the meaning of A=C is there are C-many selections from a B-

membered class of A-membered classes.

      Cardinal arithmetic concerns unordered classes, as opposed to sequences

(ordered classes). Therefore, where cardinals are concerned, be they finite

or transfinite, addition and multiplication are necessarily commutative.

Therefore, cardinal addition and multiplication are always distinct

operations from their ordinal analogues. Where finite cardinals are

concerned, cardinal addition and multiplication are in lockstep with their

ordinal analogues. This is not the case where transfinite cardinals are

concerned, and it was only when the arithmetic or transfinites was first

seriously investigated that the distinction between cardinals and ordinals

was first made. Once it was made, it proved to be of great importance,

primarily because it facilitated the development of vector-arithmetic, which

is generalized ordinal arithmetic.




            Transfinite Cardinal Arithmetic: Addition and Multiplication




  If n is any finite number, ℵ+n=ℵ. Let S be identical with (ℕ, <), that is,
                                  001

with the sequence:

0, 1, 2, 3,…

And let S be identical with the sequence:
        2

(0,0), (1,1), 0, 1, 2, 3,…

  ϕ bijects the elements of Swith the elements of S, where:
                                  1 2(i) ϕ(0)=(0,0),

(ii) ϕ(1)=(1,1), and

(iii) For any cardinal n≥3,  ϕ(n)=n+2.

  Thus, Shas exactly as many members as S, and it follows that ℵ+2=ℵ.
          1 200

By parity of reasoning, S has exactly as many members as S,  is an arbitrary
                            1n

class that contains every element of some class K that has ℵ-many
                                                                      0

members, along with n-many members that do not belong to K.

       For similar reasons, ℵ×n=ℵ, for any finite cardinal n. Explanation: Let
                            00

K be the smallest class such that:
T


(i) Every element of ℕ belongs to K, and
                                        T

(ii) For each element n of ℕ, (n, n) belongs to K.
                                                      T


      ϕ bijects ℕ and K, where
                      T

(a) ϕ(0)=(0,0),

(b) ϕ(1)=1,

(c) For any odd n>1, ϕ(n)=n−1, and  

(d) For every even n>0, ϕ(n)=(n−2, n−2).

  ϕ assigns 0 to (0,0), 1 to 1, 2 to (1,1), 3 to 2, 4 to (2, 2), and so on. It

follows that ℵ×2=ℵ. For any finite n, obvious generalizations of this
              00

reasoning establish that ℵ×n=ℵ, and non-obvious generalizations (omitted
                              00

because of their technical character and lack of importance) establish

          2
ℵ×ℵ=ℵ=ℵ.

              Transfinite Cardinal Arithmetic: Subtraction and Division




If A and B are transfinite cardinals, A−B is infinitely ambiguous, and so is

A÷B.Let K and K* each be identical with ℕ. In that case, A−B=ℵ−ℵ=0.
                                                                    00

Let A and B be identical with, respectively ℕ and the class containing every

element of ℕ other than 1. In that case, A−B=ℵ−ℵ=1.
                                                      00

Let A and B be identical with, respectively ℕ and the class containing every

element of ℕ other than 1 and 2 In that case, A−B=ℵ−ℵ=2.
                                                              00

Let A and B be identical with ℕ and the smallest class containing every even

element of ℕ. In that case, A÷B=ℵ÷ℵ=ℵ.
                                      000

Finally, let A and B both be identical with ℕ. In that case, A÷B=ℵ÷ℵ=1.  
                                                                            00

By non-obvious extensions of this reasoning (omitted because of their

technical character and lack of importance), ℵ÷ℵ may equal n, for any
                                                      00

finite n. 

                Ordinal numbers and Ordinal Transfinite Arithmetic




  Just as a cardinal number is the number of a class, an ordinal number is

the number of a series. Thus, the ordinal number 1 is the number of any

one-membered series; the ordinal number 2 is the number of any two-

membered series; and so on.

  Ordinal numbers are positions. In the series,

  4, 8, 12, 16,…

  4’s ordinal number is 1.  What this means is that the smallest 4-

containing subseries of this series contains one member.

  In the series,

  1, 2, 3, 4,…

  4’s ordinal number is 4. What this means is that the smallest 4-contaning

subseries of series contains four members.

  If a series S is finite, rearranging S’s member always yields a series S*

that has the same number of elements as S. For this reason, where finite

ordinals are concerned, addition and multiplication are commutative

operations, meaning that, if A and B are finite ordinals, then A+B=B+A and

A×B=B×A.  But if S is an infinitely long series, rearranging S’s members may yield a

series S* that does not contain the same number of elements as S.

Explanation:  Let S be (ℕ, <). So S is the series:
                    11

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,…

  And let S be the series
            2

  3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5…

S and S obviously have the same number of members.
  12

      Let S be the series:
        3

    0, 1, 3, 4, 5,…2

S has one more member than S. This is because the members of S can be
311

bijected with the elements of the segment of S that precedes 2, a
                                                      3

consequence being that S is one larger than S.  For the same reason, S is
                            313

one larger than S.
                  2

  Let ω be the number of (ℕ, <). Thus, ω= [S]=[S]. ωis the smallest
        00 120 

transfinite ordinal number.

  Given that [S] is one larger than [S], it follows that ω+1> ω, but given
                  3100

that [S2]=[S], it follows that 1+ ω= ω. And given that
            100

  These points can be generalized. Let S be the series:
                                                4

    2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5,…,

and let S be the series:
        5

    0, 1, 4, 5,…2, 3

      By obvious extensions of points already made, it follows that [S]=[S]=ω
                                                                              410

and also that S is larger by two than S. Given that  [S]=[S]=ω, it follows
                51410

that 2+ω> 1+ω>ω; and given that S is larger by two than S, it follows
        00051

that ω+2> ω+1>ω.
      000

  Moving on: Let S be the series:
                      6  0, (0, 0), 1, (1, 1), 2, (2, 2), 3, (3,3),…

and let S be the series:
        7

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,….(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)…

  Given that S can be bijected with S, it follows that [S]=ω=ω×2, where
                16600

“ω×2” is being used to denote a progression of pairs, as opposed to a pair
0

of progressions; and given that S can be bijected with the part of S
                                      17

preceding (0,0), and also with the part Sbeginning with (0,0), it follows that
                                              7 

2×ω is twice as large as each of ωand ω×2, where “2×ω” is being used to
  00 00

denote a pair of progressions, as opposed to a progression of pairs. 

  For analogous reasons, [S]=ω, whereas [S] is three times greater than
                                809

ω, where S and S are, respectively,
089

  0, (0,0), (0,0,0), 1, (1,1), (1,1,1,), 2, (2,2), (2,2,2),…

and

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,….(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)…(0,0,0), (1,1,1),

(2,2,2), (3,3,3), (4,4,4), (5,5,5),…

  To sum up, addition and multiplication are commutative where finite

ordinals are concerned but not where transfinite ordinals are concerned. 

More generally, addition and multiplication are commutative where scalar

(one-dimensional) magnitudes are concerned, but not, except under special

circumstances, where vector (n-dimensional, for n>1) magnitudes are

concerned.




                              The importance of Ordinals

      An ordinal number is a serial number, i.e. it is the number of a series.

  A series is an ordered pair (K,R), where K is a class and R is a relation

strictly orders the elements of K, meaning that if x, y and z are arbitrary

elements of K, then:

  (i) x does not bear R to x,  (ii) if x bears R to y, y does not bear R to x, and

  (iii) if x bears to y and y bears R to x, then x bears R to y.

    [(K, R)]=[(K*, R*)] means that (K, R) has the same ordinal number as

(K*, R*).

 [(K, R)]=[(K*, R*)] iff there is a one-one function ϕ such that if S is any

statement concerning the interrelations of the elements of K, ϕ(S) is an

equivalent statement about the interrelations of the elements of K*. (Two

statements s and s* are equivalent iff s is true iff s* is also true.)

  And therein lies the importance of ordinals: Series are ordinally identical

just in case truths about the one series can be represented as truths about

the other series. More generally, any two structured manifolds are ordinally

identical just in case any truth concerning the elements of the one can be

expressed as truths concerning elements of the other.  A structured

manifold is any class whose elements are ordered with respect to one

another. (A class of strictly ordered triples is a structured manifold, albeit

one of little complexity, given only two ordering-relations are involved.)

  Conversely, wherever translation is possible, there is ordinal identity. It is

only because the English language is ordinally identical with the Spanish

language that English can be translated into Spanish and vice versa.

  Ordinal numbers are mathematical representations of structure, and any

given structure is described by an ordinal number, with the qualification that

the two-dimensional ordinals that we have been considering describe

exgtremely primitive structures.

  We will now discuss some ordinal identities of a less trivial nature.



                                                                ℵ0
   Important facts about [ℝ]=2


  [ℝ]=The number of points on a line.

  Proposition: The points on a line can be bijected with the points in a two-

dimensional space; the points in a two-dimensional space can be bijected

with the points in a three-dimensional space; the class of points in an n-

dimensional space can be bijectd with the points in an n+1-dimensional

manifold. 

    Proof-preliminaries:  Each point on a line may be identified with a realnumber.

  Any given real number may be identified with an infinite series of

integers.

  Any given point in a two-dimensional space is given by an ordered pair

(A, B).

    Therefore, any given point in a two-dimensional space is given by two

infinitely long series of integers.

  Let A*B be a single integer-series consisting of the integer-series that is

    identical with A followed by the integer-series that is identical with B. In

  that case, A*B≠C*D, unless A=C and B=D.  

  Proof proper: If A*B is assigned to (A, B), for reach real-pair (A, B), the

class of real-pairs is a bijected with the class of reals. If A*B*C is assigned to

(A, B, C), for each real-triple (A, B, C), the class of real-triples is bijected with

the class of reals; and so on.

                  2n
  Thus, [ℝ]=[ℝ]=[ℝ], for any finite n.



                                                                      n
                      The significance of the fact that [ℝ]=[ℝ]

                        2
 Given that [ℝ]=[ℝ], it follows that a line can be ‘transformed’ into a

plane. More plainly, it follows that if a line segment is appropriately curved,

                                                                          2
it can fill out a two-dimensional space. Contrariwise, if [ℝ]<[ℝ], then a line

could not fill out a plane. If a line could not fill out a plane, then it would not

possible for the trajectory of an object to cover every point on a plane. This

means that the trajectory of an object would---for reasons of mathematics,

as opposed to physics or circumstance-specific fact---be limited to a proper

subset of a given plane’s points. Such a plane would not as a whole

constitute a possible physical space, since a physical space is, by definition, a

class of points that can be occupied. Therefore, such a plane would a plane

in name only.

                                                3
  For analogous reasons, unless [ℝ]=[ℝ], not all of the points in a given

plenum (three-dimensional space) could be occupied; wherefore, that

plenum would be a plenum in name only.

                              n
  So the fact that [ℝ]=[ℝ], for any finite n, is not a theoretical curiosity. On

the contrary, it is an important part of the mathematical foundation ofkinematics (the study of motion) and therefore of dynamics (the study force-

governed motion).
