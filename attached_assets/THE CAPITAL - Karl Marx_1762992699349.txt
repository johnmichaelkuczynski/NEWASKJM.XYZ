                                          Karl Marx

                                          1818-1883

 

    Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, in Trier, in the western part

of what was then the Kingdom of Prussia. His family was of Jewish

descent,  but  his  father  converted  to  Christianity,  likely  to  avoid  the

anti-Semitic laws that restricted Jewish participation in society. Marx

was  the  third  of  nine  children  in  a  middle-class  family.  His  father,

Heinrich Marx, was a successful lawyer who provided a comfortable

upbringing for his family.

    Marx attended the University of Bonn in 1835, initially studying

law. However, he found the environment at Bonn distracting and his

academic performance suffered. In 1836, he transferred to the more

rigorous University of Berlin, where he became deeply engaged in the

study of philosophy and history. It was during his time in Berlin thatMarx was influenced by the ideas of the German philosopher Georg

Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

 

    Radical Politics and Exile

    Marx's  academic  pursuits  led  him  to  embrace  radical  political

ideas.  He  became  involved  with  the  Young  Hegelians,  a  group  of

intellectuals who critiqued the political and religious establishments of

the time. Marx's radical views and his involvement in political activism

led  to  conflicts  with  authorities.  After  completing  his  studies,  he

struggled to secure a position in academia due to his controversial

views.

    In 1843, Marx moved to Paris, where he began his collaboration

with  Friedrich  Engels.  The  two  formed  a  lifelong  partnership,  with

Engels  providing  financial  support  and  contributing  to  their  joint

intellectual  projects.  In  Paris,  Marx  continued  his  radical  political

activities, leading to his expulsion from France in 1845. He moved to

Brussels, where he continued his work on revolutionary theory and

organized the Communist League with Engels.

 

    The Communist Manifesto and London Years

    In 1848, Marx and Engels published The Communist Manifesto, a

political pamphlet that called for the overthrow of capitalist societies

and the establishment of a communist society. The manifesto outlined

the  principles  of  Marxism  and  emphasized  the  role  of  the  working

class  in  bringing  about  social  change.  The  revolutionary  wave  that

swept across Europe in 1848 saw Marx involved in various political

activities, but the revolutions ultimately failed, and Marx found himself

once again facing political persecution.

    In 1849, Marx moved to London, where he would live for the rest

of his life. In London, he continued his work as a journalist, writing for

various newspapers, including the New York Daily Tribune. He also

spent  considerable  time  in  the  British  Museum,  researching  and

writing his magnum opus, Capital.

 

    Personal Struggles and Final Years

    Marx's  life  in  London  was  marked  by  financial  difficulties  and

personal  tragedies.  Despite  Engels'  financial  support,  Marx  and  hisfamily often lived in poverty. His wife, Jenny von Westphalen, whom

he married in 1843, stood by him through their many hardships. They

had seven children, but only three survived to adulthood. The Marx

family faced severe health issues, and the loss of their children deeply

affected both Karl and Jenny.

    Despite  these  challenges,  Marx  continued  his  intellectual  work.

The first volume of Capital was published in 1867, but Marx struggled

to  complete  the  subsequent  volumes  due  to  health  issues.  Engels

eventually edited and published the remaining volumes posthumously.

 

    Death and Legacy

    Karl Marx died on March 14, 1883, in London, at the age of 64.

He was buried in Highgate Cemetery, where his grave has become a

site  of  pilgrimage  for  those  influenced  by  his  ideas.  Marx's

contributions to political economy, sociology, and revolutionary theory

have left an enduring legacy. His analysis of capitalism and his vision

for a classless society have continued to inspire political movements

and academic discourse worldwide.

    Marx's work has been the subject of extensive study and debate,

and  his  ideas  have  been  applied  in  various  contexts,  from  the

development  of  socialist  and  communist  states  to  critiques  of

contemporary  capitalism.  His  influence  extends  beyond  economics

and politics, impacting fields such as philosophy, history, and cultural

studies. Despite the controversies surrounding his ideas, Karl Marx

remains one of the most influential thinkers in modern history.

 

    Capital (Das Kapital)

    Capital: Critique of Political Economy, commonly known as Das

Kapital,  is  a  foundational  theoretical  text  in  communist  philosophy,

economics, and politics by Karl Marx. The first volume was published

in 1867, with subsequent volumes published posthumously by Engels

based on Marx's notes.

 

    Structure and Content

    Capital is divided into three volumes, each addressing different

aspects of capitalist production and economics:

     Volume  I:  The  Process  of  Production  of  Capital  -  This  volume

focuses  on  the  production  process  of  capital.  It  introduces  key

concepts such as commodity, value, surplus value, and the role of

labor in creating value. Marx analyzes how commodities are produced

and  exchanged,  and  how  the  exploitation  of  labor  leads  to  the

accumulation of capital by the bourgeoisie.

    Volume  II:  The  Process  of  Circulation  of  Capital  -  Published

posthumously in 1885 by Engels, this volume examines the circulation

process  of  capital.  It  explores  the  dynamics  of  how  capital  moves

through  various  stages,  including  money  capital,  productive  capital,

and commodity capital. Marx discusses the circulation of commodities

and money, the role of credit, and the impact of these processes on

the economy.

    Volume  III:  The  Process  of  Capitalist  Production  as  a  Whole  -

Also  published  posthumously  by  Engels  in  1894,  this  volume

integrates  the  findings  of  the  first  two  volumes  and  presents  a

comprehensive  analysis  of  capitalist  production  as  a  whole.  It

addresses topics such as the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, the

formation  of  an  average  rate  of  profit,  and  the  interplay  between

different sectors of the economy.

 

    Style and Narrative

    Marx’s  writing  in Capital  is  characterized  by  its  rigorous  and

detailed  analysis  of  economic  concepts  and  processes.  His  style

combines theoretical exposition with empirical evidence, drawing on

historical examples and contemporary economic data. Marx employs

dialectical reasoning to explore the contradictions inherent in capitalist

production  and  to  demonstrate  how  these  contradictions  drive  the

dynamics of the system.

 

    Impact and Legacy

    Capital has had a profound impact on economic thought, political

theory, and the development of socialist and communist movements

worldwide.  It  provided  a  comprehensive  critique  of  the  capitalist

system, highlighting its inherent contradictions and the exploitation of

labor.  Marx's  analysis  of  capitalism  laid  the  groundwork  for  thesubsequent  development  of  Marxist  theory  and  influenced  various

fields, including sociology, political science, and economics.

    The  ideas  presented  in Capital  continue  to  be  studied  and

debated, influencing both academic discourse and practical political

movements.  Marx's  critique  of  capitalism  remains  relevant  in

contemporary discussions about economic inequality, labor rights, and

the sustainability of capitalist systems.

    Section 1. The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use Value and

Value (The Substance of Value and The Magnitude of Value)


    The  wealth  of  those  societies  in  which  the  capitalist  mode  of

production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of

commodities”,  its  unit  being  a  single  commodity.  Our  investigation

must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.

    A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that

by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another [...]

Every useful thing, as iron, paper, etc., may be looked at from the two

points of view of quality and quantity [...] The utility of a thing makes it

a use value [...] A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is

therefore,  so  far  as  it  is  a  material  thing,  a  use  value,  something

useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of

labor  required  to  appropriate  its  useful  qualities  [...]  Use  values

become a reality only by use or consumption: they also constitute the

substance  of  all  wealth,  whatever  may  be  the  social  form  of  that

wealth. In the form of society, we are about to consider, they are, in

addition, the material depositories of exchange value [...] Exchange

value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the

proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those

of another sort [...] Let us take two commodities, e. g., corn and iron.

The  proportions  in  which  they  are  exchangeable,  whatever  those

proportions  may  be,  can  always  be  represented  by  an  equation  in

which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron: e.

g., 1 quarter corn = x cwt. iron. What does this equation tell us? It tells

us that in two different things — in 1 quarter of corn and x cwt. of iron,

there exists in equal quantities something common to both [...] As use

values,  commodities  are,  above  all,  of  different  qualities,  but  as

exchange values they are merely different quantities [...], If then we

leave out of consideration the use value of commodities, they have

only one common property left, that of being products of labor [... i.e.],

human labor in the abstract [.]    Let us now consider the residue of each of these products [...]

When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them

all, they are:

    Values. We have seen that when commodities are exchanged,

their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent

of  their  use  value.  But  if  we  abstract  from  their  use  value,  there

remains their Value as defined above [...]

    A use value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because

human labor in the abstract has been embodied or materialized in it.

How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured? Plainly, by

the quantity of the value-creating substance, the labor, contained in

the  article  [...]  Some  people  might  think  that  if  the  value  of  a

commodity is determined by the quantity of labor spent on it, the idler

and unskillful the laborer, the more valuable would his commodity be,

because  more  time  would  be  required  in  its  production.  The  labor,

however, that forms the substance of value, is homogeneous human

labor, expenditure of one uniform labor power. The total labor power

of  society,  which  is  embodied  in  the  sum  total  of  the  values  of  all

commodities  produced  by  that  society,  counts  here  as  one

homogeneous mass of human labor power, composed though it be of

innumerable individual units. Each of these units is the same as any

other, so far as it has the character of the average labor power of

society,  and  takes  effect  as  such;  that  is,  so  far  as  it  requires  for

producing a commodity, no more time than is needed on an average,

no more than is socially necessary. The labor time socially necessary

is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of

production,  and  with  the  average  degree  of  skill  and  intensity

prevalent at the time [.]

    We  see  then  that  that  which  determines  the  magnitude  of  the

value of any article is the amount of labor socially necessary, or the

labor  time  socially  necessary  for  its  production.  Each  individual

commodity,  in  this  connection,  is  to  be  considered  as  an  average

sample of its class. Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities

of labor are embodied, or which can be produced in the same time,

have the same value [...] The value of a commodity would therefore

remain  constant,  if  the  labor  time  required  for  its  production  also

remained constant. But the latter changes with every variation in theproductiveness of labor. This productiveness is determined by various

circumstances, amongst others, by the average amount of skill of the

workmen,  the  state  of  science,  and  the  degree  of  its  practical

application,  the  social  organization  of  production,  the  extent  and

capabilities of the means of production, and by physical conditions.

For  example,  the  same  amount  of  labor  in  favorable  seasons  is

embodied in 8 bushels of corn, and in unfavorable, only in four [...] In

general, the greater the productiveness of labor, the less is the labor

time required for the production of an article, the less is the amount of

labor  crystallized  in  that  article,  and  the  less  is  its  value;  and  vice

versa, the less the productiveness of labor, the greater is the labor

time required for the production of an article, and the greater is its

value.  The  value  of  a  commodity,  therefore,  varies  directly  as  the

quantity,  and  inversely  as  the  productiveness,  of  the  labor

incorporated in it.

    A thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case

whenever its utility to man is not due to labor. Such are air, virgin soil,

natural  meadows,  etc.  A  thing  can  be  useful,  and  the  product  of

human labor, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies

his  wants  with  the  produce  of  his  own  labor,  creates,  indeed,  use

values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must

not  only  produce  use  values,  but  use  values  for  others,  social  use

values.  Lastly  nothing  can  have  value,  without  being  an  object  of

utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labor contained in it; the labor

does not count as labor, and therefore creates no value.



    Section 2. The Twofold Character of the Labor Embodied in

Commodities


    At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of

two things — use value and exchange value. Later on, we saw also

that  labor,  too,  possesses  the  same  twofold  nature  [...]  The  labor,

whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product, or

which manifests itself by making its product a use value, we call useful

labor. In this connection we consider only its useful effect [...] Let us

now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the valueof  commodities  [...]  Productive  activity,  if  we  leave  out  of  sight  its

special form, viz., the useful character of the labor, is nothing but the

expenditure  of  human  labor  power.  Tailoring  and  weaving,  though

qualitatively  different  productive  activities,  are  each  a  productive

expenditure of human brains, nerves, and muscles, and in this sense

are  human  labor.  They  are  but  two  different  modes  of  expending

human labor power [... The] value of a commodity represents human

labor in the abstract, the expenditure of human labor in general [...] It

is  the  expenditure  of  simple  labor  power,  i.  e.,  of  the  labor  power

which, on an average, apart from any special development, exists in

the organism of every ordinary individual. Simple average labor, it is

true, varies in character in different countries and at different times,

but  in  a  particular  society  it  is  given.  Skilled  labor  counts  only  as

simple labor intensified, or rather, as multiplied simple labor, a given

quantity  of  skilled  being  considered  equal  to  a  greater  quantity  of

simple labor […A] coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of

linen. Whence this difference in their values? It is owing to the fact that

the  linen  contains  only  half  as  much  labor  as  the  coat,  and

consequently, that in the production of the latter, labor power must

have  been  expended  during  twice  the  time  necessary  for  the

production of the former.

    [... Thus, on] the one hand, all labor is, speaking physiologically,

an expenditure of human labor power, and in its character of identical

abstract human labor, it creates and forms the value of commodities.

On the other hand, all labor is the expenditure of human labor power

in a special form and with a definite aim, and in this, its character of

concrete useful labor, it produces use values.



    Section 3. The Form of Value or Exchange Value


      Commodities  come  into  the  world  in  the  shape  of  use  values,

articles, or goods, such as iron, linen, corn, etc. This is their plain,

homely, bodily form. They are, however, commodities, only because

they are something twofold, both objects of utility, and, at the same

time,  depositories  of  value.  They  manifest  themselves  therefore  as

commodities, or have the form of commodities, only in so far as theyhave two forms, a physical or natural form, and a value form [...] If,

however, we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely

social reality, and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they

are  expressions  or  embodiments  of  one  identical  social  substance,

viz., human labor, it follows as a matter of course, that value can only

manifest  itself  in  the  social  relation  of  commodity  to  commodity.  In

fact,  we  started  from  exchange  value,  or  the  exchange  relation  of

commodities, in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it [.]

    Everyone knows, if he knows nothing else, that commodities have

a value form common to them all, and presenting a marked contrast

with the varied bodily forms of their use values. I mean their money

form. Here, however, a task is set us, the performance of which has

never yet even been attempted by bourgeois economy, the task of

tracing the genesis of this money form, of developing the expression

of value implied in the value relation of commodities, from its simplest,

almost imperceptible outline, to the dazzling money form. By doing

this we shall, at the same time, solve the riddle presented by money.

    The simplest value relation is evidently that of one commodity to

some  one  other  commodity  of  a  different  kind.  Hence  the  relation

between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest

expression of the value of a single commodity.

 

                  A. Elementary or Accidental Form of Value

    x commodity A = y commodity B, or x commodity A is worth

                                  y commodity B.

      20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1

                                          coat.

 

    The  whole  mystery  of  the  form  of  value  lies  hidden  in  this

elementary form. Its analysis, therefore, is our real difficulty. Here two

different kinds of commodities (in our example the linen and the coat),

evidently play two different parts. The linen expresses its value in the

coat; the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed.

The former plays an active, the latter a passive, part. The value of the

linen is represented as relative value, or appears in relative form. The

coat officiates as equivalent, or appears in equivalent form [...] Human

labor power in motion, or human labor, creates value, but is not itselfvalue. It becomes value only in its congealed state, when embodied in

the form of some object. In order to express the value of the linen as a

congelation of human labor, that value must be expressed as having

objective existence, as being a something materially different from the

linen itself, and yet a something common to the linen and all other

commodities  [...]  When  occupying  the  position  of  equivalent  in  the

equation of value, the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen,

as something of the same kind, because it is value. In this position it is

a thing in which we see nothing but value, or whose palpable bodily

form represents value. Yet the coat itself, the body of the commodity,

coat, is a mere use value. A coat as such no more tells us it is value,

than does the first piece of linen we take hold of. This shows that

when placed in value relation to the linen, the coat signifies more than

when  out  of  that  relation,  just  as  many  a  man  strutting  about  in  a

gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti [...]

    When,  at  the  beginning  of  this  Chapter,  we  said,  in  common

parlance,  that  a  commodity  is  both  a  use  value  and  an  exchange

value, we were, accurately speaking, wrong. A commodity is a use

value or object of utility, and a value. It manifests itself as this twofold

thing, that it is, as soon as its value assumes an independent form —

viz., the form of exchange value. It never assumes this form when

isolated, but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with

another commodity of a different kind. When once we know this, such

a  mode  of  expression  does  no  harm;  it  simply  serves  as  an

abbreviation [...]

                      B. Total or Expanded form of value

 

    z Com. A = u Com. B or = v Com. C or = w Com. D or = x Com.

                                        E or =

    (20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lbs tea or = 40 lbs coffee or

                                            =

      1 quarter corn or = 2 ounces gold or = Jr ton iron or = etc.)

 

    1. The Expanded Relative form of value

    The value of a single commodity, the linen, for example, is now

expressed  in  terms  of  numberless  other  elements  of  the  world  ofcommodities.  Every  other  commodity  now  becomes  a  mirror  of  the

linen’s value. It is thus, that for the first time, this value shows itself in

its true light as a congelation of undifferentiated human labor. For the

labor  that  creates  it,  now  stands  expressly  revealed,  as  labor  that

ranks equally with every other sort of human labor, no matter what its

form,  whether  tailoring,  ploughing,  mining,  etc.,  and  no  matter,

therefore, whether it is realized in coats, corn, iron, or gold. The linen,

by virtue of the form of its value, now stands in a social relation, no

longer with only one other kind of commodity, but with the whole world

of  commodities  [...]  The  accidental  relation  between  two  individual

commodity-owners  disappears.  It  becomes  plain,  that  it  is  not  the

exchange  of  commodities  which  regulates  the  magnitude  of  their

value; but, on the contrary, that it is the magnitude of their value which

controls their exchange proportions [.]

                          C. The General Form of Value

 











 

    [...] All commodities now express their value (1) in an elementary

form, because in a single commodity; (2) with unity, because in one

and the same commodity. This form of value is elementary and the

same for all, therefore general [...] The general form of relative value,

embracing  the  whole  world  of  commodities,  converts  the  single

commodity that is excluded from the rest, and made to play the part of

equivalent — here the linen — into the universal equivalent [.]

    If, then, in form C we replace the linen by gold, we get,

 

                                  D. The Money Form

  

    [The particular commodity with whose bodily form the equivalent

form is thus socially identified, now becomes the money commodity,

or  serves  as  money.  It  becomes  the  special  social  function  of  that

commodity, and consequently its social monopoly, to play within the

world of commodities the part of the universal equivalent.] Gold is now

money with reference to all other commodities only because it was

previously, with reference to them, a simple commodity. Like all other

commodities, it was also capable of serving as an equivalent, either as

simple equivalent in isolated exchanges, or as particular equivalent by

the side of others. Gradually it began to serve, within varying limits, as

universal equivalent. So soon as it monopolizes this position in the

expression  of  value  for  the  world  of  commodities,  it  becomes  the

money commodity, and then, and not till then, does form D become

distinct from form C, and the general form of value become changed

into the money form [...]

    The difficulty in forming a concept of the money form, consists in

clearly  comprehending  the  universal  equivalent  form,  and  as  a

necessary corollary, the general form of value, form C. The latter is

deducible  from  form  B,  the  expanded  form  of  value,  the  essential

component element of which, we saw, is form A, 20 yards of linen = 1

coat or x commodity A = y commodity B. The simple commodity form

is therefore the germ of the money form [...]



    Section  4.  He  Fetishism  of  Commodities  and  The  Secret

Thereof [...] A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because

in  it  the  social  character  of  men’s  labor  appears  to  them  as  an

objective character stamped upon the product of that labor; because

the  relation  of  the  producers  to  the  sum  total  of  their  own  labor  is

presented  to  them  as  a  social  relation,  existing  not  between

themselves, but between the products of their labor [.] There it is a

definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the

fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find

an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of

the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain

appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into

relation both with one another and the human race. So it is in the

world of commodities with the products of men’s hands. This I call the

Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labor, so soon as

they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable

from the production of commodities. This Fetishism of commodities

has  its  origin,  as  the  foregoing  analysis  has  already  shown,  in  the

peculiar social character of the labor that produces them [.]                                  Chapter 2: Exchange



    To the owner of a commodity, every other commodity is, in regard

to  his  own,  a  particular  equivalent,  and  consequently  his  own

commodity is the universal equivalent for all the others. But since this

applies  to  every  owner,  there  is,  in  fact,  no  commodity  acting  as

universal equivalent, and the relative value of commodities possesses

no general form under which they can be equated as values and have

the  magnitude  of  their  values  compared  [.]  They  cannot  bring  their

commodities  into  relation  as  values,  and  therefore  as  commodities,

except  by  comparing  them  with  some  one  other  commodity  as  the

universal equivalent. That we saw from the analysis of a commodity.

But a particular commodity cannot become the universal equivalent

except  by  a  social  act.  The  social  action  therefore  of  all  other

commodities,  sets  apart  the  particular  commodity  in  which  they  all

represent  their  values.  Thereby  the  bodily  form  of  this  commodity

becomes the form of the socially recognized universal equivalent. To

be  the  universal  equivalent,  becomes,  by  this  social  process,  the

specific function of the commodity thus excluded by the rest. Thus it

becomes - money [.]

    Money  is  a  crystal  formed  of  necessity  in  the  course  of  the

exchanges, whereby different products of labor are practically equated

to one another and thus by practice converted into commodities. The

historical progress and extension of exchanges develops the contrast,

latent in commodities, between use value and value. The necessity for

giving  an  external  expression  to  this  contrast  for  the  purposes  of

commercial intercourse, urges on the establishment of an independent

form of value, and finds no rest until it is once for all satisfied by the

differentiation  of  commodities  into  commodities  and  money.  At  the

same rate, then, as the conversion of products into commodities is

being  accomplished,  so  also  is  the  conversion  of  one  special

commodity into money.    The direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the

relative expression of value in one respect, but not in another. That

form is x Commodity A = y Commodity B. The form of direct barter is x

use value A = y use value B. The articles A and B in this case are not

as yet commodities, but become so only by the act of barter. The first

step made by an object of utility towards acquiring exchange value is

when it forms a non-use value for its owner, and that happens when it

forms a superfluous portion of some article required for his immediate

wants. Objects in themselves are external to man, and consequently

alienable by him. In order that this alienation may be reciprocal, it is

only necessary for men, by a tacit understanding, to treat each other

as private owners of those alienable objects, and by implication as

independent individuals. But such a state of reciprocal independence

has no existence in a primitive society based on property in common,

whether  such  a  society  takes  the  form  of  a  patriarchal  family,  an

ancient Indian community, or a Peruvian Inca State. The exchange of

commodities,  therefore,  first  begins  on  the  boundaries  of  such

communities, at their points of contact with other similar communities,

or with members of the latter. So soon, however, as products once

become commodities in the external relations of a community, they

also,  by  reaction,  become  so  in  its  internal  intercourse.  The

proportions in which they are exchangeable are at first quite a matter

of chance. What makes them exchangeable is the mutual desire of

their owners to alienate them. Meantime the need for foreign objects

of  utility  gradually  establishes  itself.  The  constant  repetition  of

exchange  makes  it  a  normal  social  act.  In  the  course  of  time,

therefore,  some  portion  at  least  of  the  products  of  labor  must  be

produced  with  a  special  view  to  exchange.  From  that  moment  the

distinction becomes firmly established between the utility of an object

for  the  purposes  of  consumption,  and  its  utility  for  the  purposes  of

exchange.  Its  use  value  becomes  distinguished  from  its  exchange

value.  On  the  other  hand,  the  quantitative  proportion  in  which  the

articles  are  exchangeable,  becomes  dependent  on  their  production

itself. Custom stamps them as values with definite magnitudes.

    In  the  direct  barter  of  products,  each  commodity  is  directly  a

means  of  exchange  to  its  owner,  and  to  all  other  persons  an

equivalent, but that only in so far as it has use value for them. At thisstage, therefore, the articles exchanged do not acquire a value form

independent of their own use value, or of the individual needs of the

exchangers. The necessity for a value form grows with the increasing

number and variety of the commodities exchanged. The problem and

the means of solution arise simultaneously. Commodity-owners never

equate their own commodities to those of others, and exchange them

on a large scale, without different kinds of commodities belonging to

different owners being exchangeable for, and equated as values to,

one  and  the  same  special  article.  Such  last-mentioned  article,  by

becoming  the  equivalent  of  various  other  commodities,  acquires  at

once, though within narrow limits, the character of a general social

equivalent. This character comes and goes with the momentary social

acts that called it into life. In turns and transiently it attaches itself first

to  this  and  then  to  that  commodity.  But  with  the  development  of

exchange  it  fixes  itself  firmly  and  exclusively  to  particular  sorts  of

commodities, and becomes crystallized by assuming the money form

[...]

    The  use  value  of  the  money  commodity  becomes  two-fold.  In

addition to its special use value as a commodity (gold, for instance,

serving to stop teeth, to form the raw material of articles of luxury,

etc.), it acquires a formal use value, originating in its specific social

function  [...]  We  have  seen  that  the  money  form  is  but  the  reflex,

thrown upon one single commodity, of the value relations between all

the rest. That money is a commodity is therefore a new discovery only

for those who, when they analyses it, start from its fully developed

shape. The act of exchange gives to the commodity converted into

money, not its value, but its specific value form [...] Money, like every

other commodity, cannot express the magnitude of its value except

relatively in other commodities. This value is determined by the labor

time required for its production [e.g., extraction of gold from mines],

and is expressed by the quantity of any other commodity that costs

the same amount of labor time [...] These objects, gold and silver, just

as they come out of the bowels of the earth, are forthwith the direct

incarnation of all human labor. Hence the magic of money. In the form

of society now under consideration, the behavior of men in the social

process of production is purely atomic. Hence their relations to each

other in production assume a material character independent of theircontrol  and  conscious  individual  action.  These  facts  manifest

themselves at first by products as a general rule taking the form of

commodities. We have seen how the progressive development of a

society  of  commodity  producers  stamps  one  privileged  commodity

with the character of money. Hence the riddle presented by money is

but the riddle presented by commodities; only it now strikes us in its

most glaring form.          Chapter 3: Money, Or The Circulation of commodities



    Section 1. The Measure of Values


    Throughout this work, I assume, for the sake of simplicity, gold as

the money commodity [...] It is not money that renders commodities

commensurable. Just the contrary. It is because all commodities, as

values, are realized human labor, and therefore commensurable, that

their  values  can  be  measured  by  one  and  the  same  special

commodity, and the latter be converted into the common measure of

their values, i.e., into money [...] Money as a measure of value, is the

phenomenal form that must of necessity be assumed by that measure

of value which is immanent in commodities, labor time [...] But money

itself has no price. In order to put it on an equal footing with all other

commodities in this respect, we should be obliged to equate it to itself

as its own equivalent. The price or money form of commodities is, like

their form of value generally, a form quite distinct from their palpable

bodily form; it is, therefore, a purely ideal or mental form […]

    As measure of Value, and as standard of price, money has two

entirely  distinct  functions  to  perform.  It  is  the  measure  of  value

inasmuch as it is the socially recognized incarnation of human labor; it

is the standard of price inasmuch as it is a fixed weight of metal. As

the measure of value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold

commodities  into  prices,  into  imaginary  quantities  of  gold;  as  the

standard of price it measures those quantities of gold.

    The  measure  of  values  measures  commodities  considered  as

values; the standard of price measures, on the contrary, quantities of

gold by a unit quantity of gold, not the value of one quantity of gold by

the weight of another. In order to make gold a standard of price, a

certain weight must be fixed upon as the unit. In this case, as in all

cases  of  measuring  quantities  of  the  same  denomination,  the

establishment of an unvarying unit of measure is all-important. Hence,

the less the unit is subject to variation, so much the better does thestandard  of  price  fulfil  its  office.  But  only  in  so  far  as  it  is  itself  a

product of labor, and, therefore, potentially variable in value, can gold

serve as a measure of value. It is, in the first place, quite clear that a

change in the value of gold does not, in any way, affect its function as

a standard of price. No matter how this value varies, the proportions

between  the  values  of  different  quantities  of  the  metal  remain

constant. However great the fall in its value, 12 ounces of gold still

have  12  times  the  value  of  1  ounce;  and  in  prices,  the  only  thing

considered is the relation between different quantities of gold. Since,

on the other hand, no rise or fall in the value of an ounce of gold can

alter its weight, no alteration can take place in the weight of its aliquot

parts. Thus gold always renders the same service as an invariable

standard of price, however much its value may vary. In the second

place,  a  change  in  the  value  of  gold  does  not  interfere  with  its

functions as a measure of value.

    The  change  affects  all  commodities  simultaneously,  and,

therefore, caeteris  paribus,  leaves  their  relative  values  inter  se,

unaltered, although those values are now expressed in higher or lower

gold-prices [...] A general rise in the prices of commodities can result

only, either from a rise in their values — the value of money remaining

constant  —  or  from  a  fall  in  the  value  of  money,  the  values  of

commodities remaining constant. On the other hand, a general fall in

prices can result only, either from a fall in the values of commodities

— the value of money remaining constant — or from a rise in the

value of money, the values of commodities remaining constant [...]

    Let  us  now  go  back  to  the  consideration  of  the  price  form.  By

degrees  there  arises  a  discrepancy  between  the  current  money-

names of the various weights of the precious metal figuring as money,

and the actual weights which those names originally represented [...]

The word pound, for instance, was the money-name given to an actual

pound weight of silver. When gold replaced silver as a measure of

value, the same name was applied according to the ratio between the

values of silver and gold, to perhaps 1-15th of a pound of gold. The

word pound, as a money name, thus becomes differentiated from the

same word as a weight name. The debasing of money carried on for

centuries by kings and princes to such an extent that, of the original

weights  of  the  coins,  nothing  in  fact  remained  but  the  names  [...]These historical causes convert the separation of the money name

from the weight name into an established habit with the community.

Since the standard of money is on the one hand purely conventional,

and must on the other hand find general acceptance, it is in the end

regulated by law. A given weight of one of the precious metals, an

ounce  of  gold,  for  instance,  becomes  officially  divided  into  aliquot

parts, with legally bestowed names, such as pound, dollar, etc. [...]

Hence, instead of saying: A quarter of wheat is worth an ounce of

gold; we say, it is worth £3 17s. 10 1/2d. In this way commodities

express by their prices how much they are worth, and money serves

as money of account whenever it is a question of fixing the value of an

article in its money form [...]

    Price is the money name of the labor realized in a commodity.

Hence the expression of the equivalence of a commodity with the sum

of money constituting its price, is a tautology, just as in general the

expression of the relative value of a commodity is a statement of the

equivalence  of  two  commodities.  But  although  price,  being  the

exponent of the magnitude of a commodity’s value, is the exponent of

its exchange ratio with money, it does not follow that the exponent of

this exchange ratio is necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of

the  commodity’s  value.  Suppose  two  equal  quantities  of  socially

necessary labor to be respectively represented by 1 quarter of wheat

and £2 (nearly 1/2 oz. of gold), £2 is the expression in money of the

magnitude of the value of the quarter of wheat, or is its price. If now

circumstances allow of this price being raised to £3, or compel it to be

reduced to £1, then although £1 and £3 may be too small or too great

properly to express the magnitude of the wheat’s value; nevertheless,

they are its prices, for they are, in the first place, the form under which

its value appears, i.e., money; and in the second place, the exponents

of its exchange ratio with money.

    If the conditions of production, in other words, if the productive

power of labor remain constant, the same amount of social labor time

must, both before and after the change in price, be expended in the

reproduction of a quarter of wheat [...] Magnitude of value expresses a

relation  of  social  production,  it  expresses  the  connection  that

necessarily exists between a certain article and the portion of the total

labor time of society required to produce it. As soon as magnitude ofvalue is converted into price, the above necessary relation takes the

shape of a more or less accidental exchange ratio between a single

commodity  and  another,  the  money  commodity.  But  this  exchange

ratio may express either the real magnitude of that commodity’s value,

or the quantity of gold deviating from that value, for which, according

to circumstances, it may be parted with. The possibility, therefore, of

quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude of value, or the

deviation of the former from the latter, is inherent in the price form

itself.  This  is  no  defect,  but,  on  the  contrary,  admirably  adapts  the

price  form  to  a  mode  of  production  whose  inherent  laws  impose

themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities that

compensate one another.

    The price form, however, is not only compatible with the possibility

of a quantitative incongruity between magnitude of value and price,

i.e., between the former and its expression in money, but it may also

conceal a qualitative inconsistency, so much so, that, although money

is nothing but the value form of commodities, price ceases altogether

to  express  value.  Objects  that  in  themselves  are  no  commodities,

such as conscience, honor, etc., are capable of being offered for sale

by their holders, and of thus acquiring, through their price, the form of

commodities. Hence an object may have a price without having value.

The  price  in  that  case  is  imaginary,  like  certain  quantities  in

mathematics.  On  the  other  hand,  the  imaginary  price  form  may

sometimes conceal either a direct or indirect real value relation; for

instance,  the  price  of  uncultivated  land,  which  is  without  value,

because no human labor has been incorporated in it [.]

    A price therefore implies both that a commodity is exchangeable

for money, and also that it must be so exchanged. On the other hand,

gold serves as an ideal measure of value, only because it has already,

in  the  process  of  exchange,  established  itself  as  the  money

commodity. Under the ideal measure of values there lurks the hard

cash.



    Section 2. The Medium of Circulation


                  [a. The Metamorphosis of Commodities]    Let us now accompany the owner of some commodity — say, our

old friend the weaver of linen — to the scene of action, the market. His

20 yards of linen has a definite price, £2. He exchanges it for the £2,

and then, like a man of the good old stamp that he is, he parts with the

£2 for a family Bible of the same price. The linen, which in his eyes is

a mere commodity, a depository of value, he alienates in exchange for

gold, which is the linen’s value form, and this form he again parts with

for another commodity, the Bible, which is destined to enter his house

as an object of utility and of edification to its inmates. The exchange

becomes an accomplished fact by two metamorphoses of opposite yet

supplementary  character  -  the  conversion  of  the  commodity  into

money, and the re-conversion of the money into a commodity. The

two  phases  of  this  metamorphosis  are  both  of  them  distinct

transactions  of  the  weaver  —  selling,  or  the  exchange  of  the

commodity for money; buying, or the exchange of the money for a

commodity; and, the unity of the two acts, selling in order to buy [...]

    The exchange of commodities is therefore accompanied by the

following changes in their form.

                          Commodity - Money - Commodity.

                                      C-------M--------C.

    The result of the whole process is, so far as concerns the objects

themselves, C - C, the exchange of one commodity for another, the

circulation of materialized social labor. When this result is attained, the

process is at an end.


                    C — M. First metamorphosis, or sale


    [...] A commodity strips off its original commodity form on being

alienated, i.e., on the instant its use value actually attracts the gold,

that  before  existed  only  ideally  in  its  price.  The  realization  of  a

commodity’s price, or of its ideal value form, is therefore at the same

time the realization of the ideal use value of money; the conversion of

a commodity into money, is the simultaneous conversion of money

into a commodity. The apparently single process is in reality a double

one.  From  the  pole  of  the  commodity-owner  it  is  a  sale,  from  the

opposite pole of the money-owner, it is a purchase. In other words, a

sale is a purchase, C-M is also M-C [.] We will assume that the two

gold pieces, in consideration of which our weaver has parted with hislinen, are the metamorphosed shape of a quarter of wheat. The sale

of the linen, C-M, is at the same time its purchase, M-C. But the sale

is the first act of a process that ends with a transaction of an opposite

nature, namely, the purchase of a Bible; the purchase of the linen, on

the other hand, ends a movement that began with a transaction of an

opposite  nature,  namely,  with  the  sale  of  the  wheat.  C-M  (linen-

money), which is the first phase of C-M-C (linen-money-Bible), is also

M-C  (money-linen),  the  last  phase  of  another  movement  C-M-C

(wheat-money-linen). The first metamorphosis of one commodity, its

transformation  from  a  commodity  into  money,  is  therefore  also

invariably the second metamorphosis of some other commodity, the

retransformation of the latter from money into a commodity [...]


                    M—C, or purchase. The second and

                  concluding metamorphosis of a commodity


    [...]  M-C,  a  purchase,  is,  at  the  same  time,  C-M,  a  sale;  the

concluding  metamorphosis  of  one  commodity  is  the  first

metamorphosis of another. With regard to our weaver, the life of his

commodity ends with the Bible, into which he has reconverted his £2.

But suppose the seller of the Bible turns the £2 set free by the weaver

into brandy M-C, the concluding phase of C-M-C (linen-money-Bible),

is  also  C-M,  the  first  phase  of  C-M-C  (Bible-money-brandy).  The

producer of a particular commodity has that one article alone to offer;

this he sells very often in large quantities, but his many and various

wants compel him to split up the price realized, the sum of money set

free,  into  numerous  purchases.  Hence  a  sale  leads  to  many

purchases  of  various  articles.  The  concluding  metamorphosis  of  a

commodity thus constitutes an aggregation of first metamorphoses of

various other commodities.

    [...]  If  we  now  consider  the  completed  metamorphosis  of  a

commodity, as a whole, it appears in the first place, that it is made up

of two opposite and complementary movements, C-M and M-C. These

two antithetical transmutations of a commodity are brought about by

two antithetical social acts on the part of the owner, and these acts in

their turn stamp the character of the economic parts played by him. As

the person who makes a sale, he is a seller; as the person who makes

a purchase, he is a buyer. But just as, upon every such transmutationof a commodity, its two forms, commodity form and money form, exist

simultaneously  but  at  opposite  poles,  so  every  seller  has  a  buyer

opposed  to  him,  and  every  buyer  a  seller.  While  one  particular

commodity is going through its two transmutations in succession, from

a commodity into money and from money into another commodity, the

owner of the commodity changes in succession his part from that of

seller to that of buyer [.]

    The two metamorphoses constituting the circuit are at the same

time  two  inverse  partial  metamorphoses  of  two  other  commodities.

One and the same commodity, the linen, opens the series of its own

metamorphoses, and completes the metamorphosis of another (the

wheat). In the first phase or sale, the linen plays these two parts in its

own person. But, then, changed into gold, it completes its own second

and final metamorphosis, and helps at the same time to accomplish

the first metamorphosis of a third commodity. Hence the circuit made

by one commodity in the course of its metamorphoses is inextricably

mixed up with the circuits of other commodities. The total of all the

different circuits constitutes the circulation of commodities.

    [...]  It  is  only  because  the  farmer  has  sold  his  wheat  that  the

weaver is enabled to sell his linen, only because the weaver has sold

his  linen  that  our  Hotspur  is  enabled  to  sell  his  Bible,  and  only

because the latter has sold the water of everlasting life that the distiller

is enabled to sell his eau-de-vie, and so on.

    The process of circulation, therefore, does not, like direct barter of

products, become extinguished upon the use values changing places

and hands. The money does not vanish on dropping out of the circuit

of  the  metamorphosis  of  a  given  commodity.  It  is  constantly  being

precipitated  into  new  places  in  the  arena  of  circulation  vacated  by

other commodities. In the complete metamorphosis of the linen, for

example, linen-money-Bible, the linen first falls out of circulation, and

money steps into its place. Then the Bible falls out of circulation, and

again money takes its place. When one commodity replaces another,

the  money  commodity  always  sticks  to  the  hands  of  some  third

person. Circulation sweats money from every pore [...] If the interval in

time  between  the  two  complementary  phases  of  the  complete

metamorphosis of a commodity become too great, if the split between

the  sale  and  the  purchase  become  too  pronounced,  the  intimateconnection between them, their oneness, asserts itself by producing

— a crisis. The antithesis, use value and value; the contradictions that

private labor is bound to manifest itself as direct social labor, that a

particularized concrete kind of labor has to pass for abstract human

labor; the contradiction between the personification of objects and the

representation  of  persons  by  things;  all  these  antitheses  and

contradictions,  which  are  immanent  in  commodities,  assert

themselves,  and  develop  their  modes  of  motion,  in  the  antithetical

phases of the metamorphosis of a commodity. These modes therefore

imply the possibility, and no more than the possibility, of crises. The

conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of a long

series  of  relations,  that,  from  our  present  standpoint  of  simple

circulation, have as yet no existence [...]


                          [b. The currency of money]


    The  change  of  form,  C-M-C,  by  which  the  circulation  of  the

material products of labor is brought about, requires that a given value

in the shape of a commodity shall begin the process, and shall, also in

the shape of a commodity, end it. The movement of the commodity is

therefore  a  circuit.  On  the  other  hand,  the  form  of  this  movement

precludes a circuit from being made by the money. The result is not

the return of the money, but its continued removal further and further

away from its starting-point. So long as the seller sticks fast to his

money,  which  is  the  transformed  shape  of  his  commodity,  that

commodity  is  still  in  the  first  phase  of  its  metamorphosis,  and  has

completed  only  half  its  course.  But  so  soon  as  he  completes  the

process,  so  soon  as  he  supplements  his  sale  by  a  purchase,  the

money  again  leaves  the  hands  of  its  possessor  [...]  Hence  the

movement  directly  imparted  to  money  by  the circulation  of

commodities  takes  the  form  of  a  constant  motion  away  from  its

starting-point, of a course from the hands of one commodity owner

into those of another. This course constitutes its currency (cours de la

monnaie). The currency of money is the constant and monotonous

repetition of the same process [...]

    Every  commodity,  when  it  first  steps  into  circulation,  and

undergoes  its  first  change  of  form,  does  so  only  to  fall  out  ofcirculation again and to be replaced by other commodities. Money, on

the contrary, as the medium of circulation, keeps continually within the

sphere of circulation, and moves about in it. The question therefore

arises; how much money this sphere constantly absorbs?

    In a given country there take place every day at the same time,

but  in  different  localities,  numerous  one-sided  metamorphoses  of

commodities,  or,  in  other  words,  numerous  sales  and  numerous

purchases. The commodities are equated beforehand in imagination,

by their prices, to definite quantities of money. And since, in the form

of  circulation  now  under  consideration,  money  and  commodities

always come bodily face to face, one at the positive pole of purchase,

the other at the negative pole of sale, it is clear that the amount of the

means of circulation required, is determined beforehand by the sum of

the prices of all these commodities. As a matter of fact, the money in

reality  represents  the  quantity  or  sum  of  gold  ideally  expressed

beforehand by the sum of the prices of the commodities. The equality

of these two sums is therefore self-evident. We know, however, that,

the values of commodities remaining constant, their prices vary with

the value of gold (the material of money), rising in proportion as it falls,

and falling in proportion as it rises. Now if, in consequence of such a

rise or fall in the value of gold, the sum of the prices of commodities

fall or rise, the quantity of money in currency must fall or rise to the

same extent [.]

    If  the  mass  of  commodities  remains  constant,  the  quantity  of

circulating money varies with the fluctuations in the prices of those

commodities.  It  increases  and  diminishes  because  the  sum  of  the

prices increases or diminishes in consequence of the change of price

[...]  Suppose  the  following  articles  to  be  sold  or  partially

metamorphosed simultaneously in different localities: say, one quarter

of wheat, 20 yards of linen, one Bible, and 4 gallons of brandy. If the

price of each article be £2, and the sum of the prices to be realized be

consequently £8, it follows that £8 in money must go into circulation

[...] Hence the velocity of the currency of money is measured by the

number of moves made by a given piece of money in a given time.

Suppose the circulation of the 4 articles takes a day. The sum of the

prices to be realized in the day is £8, the number of moves of the two

pieces of money is four, and the quantity of money circulating is £2.Hence, for a given interval of time during the process of circulation, we

have the following relation: the quantity of money functioning as the

circulating  medium  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  prices  of  the

commodities divided by the number of moves made by coins of the

same denomination [.]

    The total quantity of money functioning during a given period as

the circulating medium, is determined, on the one hand, by the sum of

the prices of the circulating commodities, and on the other hand, by

the rapidity with which the antithetical phases of the metamorphoses

follow one another. On this rapidity depends what proportion of the

sum of the prices can, on the average, be realized by each single

coin. But the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends

on the quantity, as well as on the prices, of the commodities. These

three  factors,  however,  state  of  prices,  quantity  of  circulating

commodities, and velocity of money-currency, are all variable. Hence,

the sum of the prices to be realized, and consequently the quantity of

the  circulating  medium  depending  on  that  sum,  will  vary  with  the

numerous variations of these three factors in combination [.]


                        [c. Coin and symbols of value]


    The only difference, therefore, between coin and bullion, is one of

shape, and gold can at any time pass from one form to the other. But

no sooner does coin leave the mint, then it immediately finds itself on

the  high-road  to  the  melting  pot.  During  their  currency,  coins  wear

away, some more, others less. Name and substance, nominal weight

and real weight, begin their process of separation. Coins of the same

denomination become different in value, because they are different in

weight.  The  weight  of  gold  fixed  upon  as  the  standard  of  prices,

deviates from the weight that serves as the circulating medium, and

the latter thereby ceases any longer to be a real equivalent of the

commodities whose prices it realizes. The history of coinage during

the  Middle  Ages  and  down  into  the  18th  century,  records  the  ever

renewed confusion arising from this cause. The natural tendency of

circulation  to  convert  coins  into  a  mere  semblance  of  what  they

profess to be, into a symbol of the weight of metal they are officially

supposed to contain, is recognized by modern legislation, which fixesthe loss of weight sufficient to demonetize a gold coin, or to make it no

longer legal tender.

    The  fact  that  the  currency  of  coins  itself  effects  a  separation

between  their  nominal  and  their  real  weight,  creating  a  distinction

between them as mere pieces of metal on the one hand, and as coins

with  a  definite  function  on  the  other  —  this  fact  implies  the  latent

possibility of replacing metallic coins by tokens of some other material,

by  symbols  serving  the  same  purposes  as  coins.  The  practical

difficulties in the way of coining extremely minute quantities of gold or

silver,  and  the  circumstance  that  at  first  the  less  precious  metal  is

used  as  a  measure  of  value  instead  of  the-more  precious,  copper

instead  of  silver,  silver  instead  of  gold,  and  that  the  less  precious

circulates as money until dethroned by the more precious — all these

facts explain the parts historically played by silver and copper tokens

as substitutes for gold coins [...]

    The weight of metal in the silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily

fixed by law. When in currency, they wear away even more rapidly

than gold coins. Hence their functions are totally independent of their

weight, and consequently of all value. The function of gold as coin

becomes completely independent of the metallic value of that gold.

Therefore,  things  that  are  relatively  without  value,  such  as  paper

notes, can serve as coins in its place. This purely symbolic character

is  to  a  certain  extent  masked  in  metal  tokens.  In  paper  money  it

stands out plainly [...]

    The State puts in circulation bits of paper on which their various

denominations, say £1, £5, etc., are printed. In so far as they actually

take the place of gold to the same amount, their movement is subject

to the laws that regulate the currency of money itself. A law peculiar to

the circulation of paper money can spring up only from the proportion

in which that paper money represents gold. Such a law exists; stated

simply, it is as follows: the issue of paper money must not exceed in

amount the gold (or silver as the case may be) which would actually

circulate if not replaced by symbols [...] If the quantity of paper money

issued be double what it ought to be, then, as a matter of fact, £1

would be the money name not of 1/4 of an ounce, but of 1/8 of an

ounce of gold. The effect would be the same as if an alteration had

taken  place  in  the  function  of  gold  as  a  standard  of  prices.  Thosevalues that were previously expressed by the price of £1 would now

be expressed by the price of £2.



    Section 3. Money


                                    [A. Hoarding]


    With  the  very  earliest  development  of  the circulation  of

commodities,  there  is  also  developed  the  necessity,  and  the

passionate desire, to hold fast the product of the first metamorphosis.

This product is the transformed shape of the commodity, or its gold-

chrysalis. Commodities are thus sold not for the purpose of buying

others, but in order to replace their commodity form by their money

form.  From  being  the  mere  means  of  effecting  the circulation  of

commodities,  this  change  of  form  becomes  the  end  and  aim.  The

changed form of the commodity is thus prevented from functioning as

its  unconditionally  alienable  form,  or  as  its  merely  transient  money

form.  The  money  becomes  petrified  into  a  hoard,  and  the  seller

becomes a hoarder of money [...]

    As  the  production  of  commodities  further  develops,  every

producer  of  commodities  is  compelled  to  make  sure  of  the nexus

rerum  or  the  social  pledge.  His  wants  are  constantly  making

themselves  felt,  and  necessitate  the  continual  purchase  of  other

people’s commodities, while the production and sale of his own goods

require time, and depend upon circumstances. In order then to be able

to buy without selling, he must have sold previously without buying.

This  operation,  conducted  on  a  general  scale,  appears  to  imply  a

contradiction.  But  the  precious  metals  at  the  sources  of  their

production are directly exchanged for other commodities. And here we

have sales (by the owners of commodities) without purchases (by the

owners of gold or silver). And subsequent sales, by other producers,

unfollowed by purchases, merely bring about the distribution of the

newly  produced  precious  metals  among  all  the  owners  of

commodities. In this way, all along the line of exchange, hoards of

gold and silver of varied extent are accumulated. With the possibility ofholding and storing up exchange value in the shape of a particular

commodity, arises also the greed for gold.

    Along  with  the  extension  of  circulation,  increases  the  power  of

money, that absolutely social form of wealth ever ready for use [.] It is

true that the value of money varies, at one time in consequence of a

variation in its own value, at another, in consequence of a change in

the  values  of  commodities.  But  this,  on  the  one  hand,  does  not

prevent 200 ounces of gold from still containing more value than 100

ounces, nor, on the other hand, does it hinder the actual metallic form

of this article from continuing to be the universal equivalent form of all

other commodities, and the immediate social incarnation of all human

labor. The desire after hoarding is in its very nature unsatiable [.] In

order  that  the  mass  of  money,  actually  current,  may  constantly

saturate the absorbing power of the circulation, it is necessary that the

quantity of gold and silver in a country be greater than the quantity

required to function as coin. This condition is fulfilled by money taking

the form of hoards. These reserves serve as conduits for the supply or

withdrawal of money to or from the circulation, which in this way never

overflows its banks.


                              [b. Means of Payment]


    In  the  simple  form  of  the circulation  of  commodities  hitherto

considered,  we  found  a  given  value  always  presented  to  us  in  a

double shape, as a commodity at one pole, as money at the opposite

pole. The owners of commodities came therefore into contact as the

respective representatives of what were already equivalents. But with

the  development  of  circulation,  conditions  arise  under  which  the

alienation of commodities becomes separated, by an interval of time,

from the realization of their prices [...] The vendor sells an existing

commodity, the purchaser buys as the mere representative of money,

or  rather  of  future  money.  The  vendor  becomes  a  creditor;  the

purchaser  becomes  a  debtor.  Since  the  metamorphosis  of

commodities, or the development of their value form, appears here

under a new aspect, money also acquires a fresh function; it becomes

the means of payment [...]

    The  character  of  creditor,  or  of  debtor,  results  here  from  the

simple circulation. The change in the form of that circulation stampsbuyer and seller with this new die [at first ...] The appearance of the

two  equivalents,  commodities  and  money,  at  the  two  poles  of  the

process of sale, has ceased to be simultaneous. The money functions

now, first as a measure of value in the determination of the price of the

commodity  sold;  the  price  fixed  by  the  contract  measures  the

obligation of the debtor, or the sum of money that he has to pay at a

fixed date. Secondly, it serves as an ideal means of purchase [...] The

value form of commodities, money, is therefore now the end and aim

of a sale, and that owing to a social necessity springing out of the

process  of  circulation  itself.  The  buyer  converts  money  back  into

commodities before he has turned commodities into money: in other

words, he achieves the second metamorphosis of commodities before

the first [...] The obligations falling due within a given period, represent

the sum of the prices of the commodities, the sale of which gave rise

to  those  obligations.  The  quantity  of  gold  necessary  to  realize  this

sum, depends, in the first instance, on the rapidity of currency of the

means of payment. That quantity is conditioned by two circumstances:

first the relations between debtors and creditors form a sort of chain,

in such a way that A, when he receives money from his debtor B,

straightway  hands  it  over  to  C  his  creditor,  and  so  on;  the  second

circumstance is the length of the intervals between the different due

days  of  the  obligations  [...]  In  proportion  as  payments  are

concentrated  at  one  spot,  special  institutions  and  methods  are

developed  for  their  liquidation.  Such  in  the  Middle  Ages  were  the

virements at Lyons. The debts due to A from B, to B from C, to C from

A, and so on, have only to be confronted with each other, in order to

annul  each  other  to  a  certain  extent  like  positive  and  negative

quantities.  There  thus  remains  only  a  single  balance  to  pay.  The

greater  the  amount  of  the  payments  concentrated,  the  less  is  this

balance  relatively  to  that  amount,  and  the  less  is  the  mass  of  the

means of payment in circulation [...]

    If we now consider the sum total of the money current during a

given period, we shall find that, given the rapidity of currency of the

circulating medium and of the means of payment, it is equal to the

sum of the prices to be realized, plus the sum of the payments falling

due, minus the payments that balance each other, minus finally the

number of circuits in which the same piece of coin serves in turn asmeans of circulation and of payment [. To] the same extent as the

system of credit is extended, so is the function of money as a means

of  payment  [...  It]  makes  itself  at  home  in  the  sphere  of  great

commercial transactions. Gold and silver coin, on the other hand, are

mostly relegated to the sphere of retail trade. When the production of

commodities has sufficiently extended itself, money begins to serve as

the  means  of  payment  beyond  the  sphere  of  the circulation  of

commodities. It becomes the commodity that is the universal subject-

matter  of  all  contracts.  Rents,  taxes,  and  such  like  payments  are

transformed  from  payments  in  kind  into  money  payments.  To  what

extent  this  transformation  depends  upon  the  general  conditions  of

production, is shown, to take one example, by the fact that the Roman

Empire twice failed in its attempt to levy all contributions in money [...]

    From the law of the rapidity of currency of the means of payment,

it follows that the quantity of the means of payment required for all

periodical payments, whatever their source, is in inverse proportion to

the length of their periods. The development of money into a medium

of  payment  makes  it  necessary  to  accumulate  money  against  the

dates fixed for the payment of the sums owing. While hoarding, as a

distinct mode of acquiring riches, vanishes with the progress of civil

society, the formation of reserves of the means of payment grows with

that progress.


                              [c. Universal Money]


    [...] Within the sphere of home circulation, there can be but one

commodity which, by serving as a measure of value, becomes money.

In the markets of the world a double measure of value holds sway,

gold and silver. Money of the world serves as the universal medium of

payment, as the universal means of purchasing, and as the universally

recognized  embodiment  of  all  wealth.  Its  function  as  a  means  of

payment in the settling of international balances is its chief one [...]

Just  as  every  country  needs  a  reserve  of  money  for  its  home

circulation  so,  too,  it  requires  one  for  external  circulation  in  the

markets of the world. The functions of hoards, therefore, arise in part

out of the function of money, as the medium of the home circulation

and home payments, and in part out of its function of money of theworld  [...]  Countries  in  which  the  bourgeois  form  of  production  is

developed  to  a  certain  extent,  limit  the  hoards  concentrated  in  the

strong  rooms  of  the  banks  to  the  minimum  required  for  the  proper

performance of their peculiar functions. Whenever these hoards are

strikingly above their average level, it is, with some exceptions, an

indication  of  stagnation  in  the circulation  of  commodities,  of  an

interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses.      PART 2: THE TRANSFORMATION OF MONEY INTO

                                      CAPITAL                  Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital



    The circulation of commodities is the starting-point of capital. The

production of commodities, their circulation, and that more developed

form  of  their  circulation  called  commerce,  these  form  the  historical

ground-work from which it rises. The modern history of capital dates

from the creation in the 16th century of a world-embracing commerce

and a world-embracing market.

    If  we  abstract  from  the  material  substance  of  the circulation of

commodities, that is, from the exchange of the various use values,

and consider only the economic forms produced by this process of

circulation, we find its final result to be money: this final product of the

circulation of commodities is the first form in which capital appears.

    As  a  matter  of  history,  capital,  as  opposed  to  landed  property,

invariably  takes  the  form  at  first  of  money;  it  appears  as  moneyed

wealth, as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer.1 But we have

no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover that the first

form of appearance of capital is money. We can see it daily under our

very eyes. All new capital, to commence with, comes on the stage,

that is, on the market, whether of commodities, labor, or money, even

in our days, in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be

transformed into capital.

    The first distinction we notice between money that is money only,

and money that is capital, is nothing more than a difference in their

form of circulation.

    The simplest form of the circulation of commodities is C-M-C, the

transformation  of  commodities  into  money,  and  the  change  of  the

money back again into commodities; or selling in order to buy. But

alongside of this form we find another specifically different form: M-C-

M, the transformation of money into commodities, and the change of

commodities back again into money; or buying in order to sell. Money

that  circulates  in  the  latter  manner  is  thereby  transformed  into,

becomes capital, and is already potentially capital.

    Now let us examine the circuit M-C-M a little closer. It consists,

like the other, of two antithetical phases. In the first phase, M-C, or thepurchase,  the  money  is  changed  into  a  commodity.  In  the  second

phase, C-M, or the sale, the commodity is changed back again into

money. The combination of these two phases constitutes the single

movement whereby money is exchanged for a commodity, and the

same  commodity  is  again  exchanged  for  money;  whereby  a

commodity is bought in order to be sold, or, neglecting the distinction

in form between buying and selling, whereby a commodity is bought

with money, and then money is bought with a commodity. The result,

in which the phases of the process vanish, is the exchange of money

for money, M-M. If I purchase 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £100, and resell

the 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £110, I have, in fact, exchanged £100 for

£110, money for money.

    Now  it  is  evident  that  the  circuit  M-C-M  would  be  absurd  and

without meaning if the intention were to exchange by this means two

equal sums of money, £100 for £100 [...] quite different in kind from

that which [...] goes through in the hands of the peasant who sells

corn,  and  with  the  money  thus  set  free  buys  clothes.  We  have

therefore  to  examine  first  the  distinguishing  characteristics  of  the

forms  of  the  circuits  M-C-M  and  C-M-C,  and  in  doing  this  the  real

difference that underlies the mere difference of form will reveal itself.

    Both circuits are resolvable into the same two antithetical phases,

CM, a sale, and M-C, a purchase [...] In the circulation C-M-C, the

money is in the end converted into a commodity, that serves as a use

value;  it  is  spent  once  for  all.  In  the  inverted  form,  M-C-M,  on  the

contrary, the buyer lays out money in order that, as a seller, he may

recover money [...] The money, therefore, is not spent, it is merely

advanced  [...]  The  circuit  C-M-C  starts  with  one  commodity,  and

finishes  with  another,  which  falls  out  of  circulation  and  into

consumption.  Consumption,  the  satisfaction  of  wants,  in  one  word,

use  value,  is  its  end  and  aim.  The  circuit  M-C-M,  on  the  contrary,

commences with money and ends with money. Its leading motive, and

the  goal  that  attracts  it,  is  therefore  mere  exchange  value  [...]  To

exchange £100 for cotton, and then this same cotton again for £100,

is  merely  a  roundabout  way  of  exchanging  money  for  money,  the

same  for  the  same,  and  appears  to  be  an  operation  just  as

purposeless as it is absurd. One sum of money is distinguishable from

another  only  by  its  amount.  The  character  and  tendency  of  theprocess  M-C-M,  is  therefore  not  due  to  any  qualitative  difference

between  its  extremes,  both  being  money,  but  solely  to  their

quantitative difference. More money is withdrawn from circulation at

the  finish  than  was  thrown  into  it  at  the  start.  The  cotton  that  was

bought for £100 is perhaps resold for £100 + £10 or £110. The exact

form of this process is therefore M-C-M’, where M’ = M + AM = the

original sum advanced, plus an increment. This increment or excess

over  the  original  value  I  call  “surplus  value”.  The  value  originally

advanced, therefore, not only remains intact while in circulation, but

adds to itself a surplus value or expands itself. It is this movement that

converts it into capital.

    The simple circulation of commodities — selling in order to buy —

is a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with circulation,

namely, the appropriation of use values, the satisfaction of wants. The

circulation of money as capital is, on the contrary, an end in itself, for

the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed

movement. The circulation of capital has therefore no limits.

    As the conscious representative of this movement, the possessor

of money becomes a capitalist [...] The expansion of value, which is

the objective basis or mainspring of the circulation M-C-M, becomes

his subjective aim, and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever

more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his

operations,  that  he  functions  as  a  capitalist,  that  is,  as  capital

personified and endowed with consciousness and a will. Use values

must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist;

neither must the profit on any single transaction. The restless never-

ending  process  of  profit-making  alone  is  what  he  aims  at.  This

boundless greed after riches, this passionate chase after exchange

value, is common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is

merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser. The

never-ending  augmentation  of  exchange  value,  which  the  miser

strives after, by seeking to save his money from circulation, is attained

by  the  more  acute  capitalist,  by  constantly  throwing  it  afresh  into

circulation.

    The independent form, i.e., the money form, which the value of

commodities assumes in the case of simple circulation, serves only

one purpose, namely, their exchange, and vanishes in the final resultof the movement. On the other hand, in the circulation M-C-M, both

the  money  and  the  commodity  represent  only  different  modes  of

existence  of  value  itself,  the  money  its  general  mode,  and  the

commodity its particular, or, so to say, disguised mode. It is constantly

changing from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost,

and thus assumes an automatically active character. If now we take in

turn  each  of  the  two  different  forms  which  self-expanding  value

successively assumes in the course of its life, we then arrive at these

two propositions: Capital is money: Capital is commodities. In truth,

however, value is here the active factor in a process, in which, while

constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it at

the same time changes in magnitude, differentiates itself by throwing

off surplus value from itself; the original value, in other words, expands

spontaneously [...]

    Buying in order to sell, or, more accurately, buying in order to sell

dearer, M-C-M’, appears certainly to be a form peculiar to one kind of

capital alone, namely, merchants’ capital. But industrial capital too is

money, that is changed into commodities, and by the sale of these

commodities, is re-converted into more money. The events that take

place  outside  the  sphere  of  circulation,  in  the  interval  between  the

buying and selling, do not affect the form of this movement. Lastly, in

the  case  of  interest-bearing  capital,  the  circulation  M-C-M’  appears

abridged.  We  have  its  result  without  the  intermediate  stage,  in  the

form M-M’, “en style lapidaire” so to say, money that is worth more

money, value that is greater than itself.

    M-C-M' is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it

appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation.      Chapter 5: Contradictions in The General Formula of Capital



    The form which circulation takes when money becomes capital, is

opposed to all the laws we have hitherto investigated bearing on the

nature of commodities, value and money, and even of circulation itself.

What  distinguishes  this  form  from  that  of  the  simple circulation  of

commodities, is the inverted order of succession of the two antithetical

processes, sale and purchase. How can this purely formal distinction

between these processes change their character as it were by magic?

    But that is not all. This inversion has no existence for two out of

the three persons who transact business together. As capitalist, I buy

commodities from A and sell them again to B, but as a simple owner

of commodities, I sell them to B and then purchase fresh ones from A.

A and B see no difference between the two sets of transactions. They

are merely buyers or sellers. And I on each occasion meet them as a

mere owner of either money or commodities, as a buyer or a seller,

and, what is more, in both sets of transactions, I am opposed to A only

as a buyer and to B only as a seller, to the one only as money, to the

other  only  as  commodities,  and  to  neither  of  them  as  capital  or  a

capitalist, or as representative of anything that is more than money or

commodities, or that can produce any effect beyond what money and

commodities can [...]

    Let  us  take  the  process  of  circulation  in  a  form  under  which  it

presents itself as a simple and direct exchange of commodities. This

is always the case when two owners of commodities buy from each

other, and on the settling day the amounts mutually owing are equal

and cancel each other. The money in this case is money of account

and serves to express the value of the commodities by their prices,

but is not, itself, in the shape of hard cash, confronted with them. So

far as regards use values, it is clear that both parties may gain some

advantage. Both part with goods that, as use values, are of no service

to them, and receive others that they can make use of. And there may

also  be  a  further  gain.  A,  who  sells  wine  and  buys  corn,  possiblyproduces more wine, with given labor time, than farmer B could, and B

on the other hand, more corn than wine-grower A could. A, therefore,

may get, for the same exchange value, more corn, and B more wine,

than each would respectively get without any exchange by producing

his own corn and wine. With reference, therefore, to use value, there

is good ground for saying that “exchange is a transaction by which

both sides gain”. It is otherwise with exchange value. “A man who has

plenty of wine and no corn treats with a man who has plenty of corn

and no wine; an exchange takes place between them of corn to the

value of 50, for wine of the same value. This act produces no increase

of exchange value either for the one or the other; for each of them

already possessed, before the exchange, a value equal to that which

he acquired by means of that operation” [...]

    Suppose then, that by some inexplicable privilege, the seller is

enabled to sell his commodities above their value, what is worth 100

for 110, in which case the price is nominally raised 10%. The seller

therefore  pockets  a  surplus  value  of  10.  But  after  he  has  sold  he

becomes a buyer. A third owner of commodities comes to him now as

seller,  who  in  this  capacity  also  enjoys  the  privilege  of  selling  his

commodities 10% too dear. Our friend gained 10 as a seller only to

lose  it  again  as  a  buyer.  The  net  result  is,  that  all  owners  of

commodities sell their goods to one another at 10% above their value,

which comes precisely to the same as if they sold them at their true

value [...] The creation of surplus value, and therefore the conversion

of money into capital, can consequently be explained neither on the

assumption that commodities are sold above their value, nor that they

are bought below their value [... However, what if] A may be clever

enough to get the advantage of B or C without their being able to

retaliate.  A  sells  wine  worth  £40  to  B,  and  obtains  from  him  in

exchange corn to the value of £50. A has converted his £40 into £50,

has  made  more  money  out  of  less,  and  has  converted  his

commodities  into  capital.  Let  us  examine  this  a  little  more  closely.

Before the exchange we had £40 worth of wine in the hands of A, and

£50  worth  of  corn  in  those  of  B,  a  total  value  of  £90.  After  the

exchange  we  have  still  the  same  total  value  of  £90.  The  value  in

circulation  has  not  increased  by  one  iota,  it  is  only  distributed

differently between A and B [...] Turn and twist then as we may, thefact remains unaltered. If equivalents are exchanged, no surplus value

results, and if non-equivalents are exchanged, still no surplus value.

Circulation, or the exchange of commodities, begets no value [...]

    We  have  shown  that  surplus  value  cannot  be  created  by

circulation, and, therefore, that in its formation, something must take

place in the background, which is not apparent in the circulation itself.

But  can  surplus  value  possibly  originate  anywhere  else  than  in

circulation,  which  is  the  sum  total  of  all  the  mutual  relations  of

commodity-owners,  as  far  as  they  are  determined  by  their

commodities?  [...  In  production,  the]  commodity  owner  can,  by  his

labor, create value, but not self-expanding value. He can increase the

value  of  his  commodity,  by  adding  fresh  labor,  and  therefore  more

value to the value in hand, by making, for instance, leather into boots.

The same material has now more value, because it contains a greater

quantity  of  labor.  The  boots  have  therefore  more  value  than  the

leather, but the value of the leather remains what it was; it has not

expanded  itself,  has  not,  during  the  making  of  the  boots,  annexed

surplus  value.  It  is  therefore  impossible  that  outside  the  sphere  of

circulation,  a  producer  of  commodities  can,  without  coming  into

contact  with  other  commodity-owners,  expand  value,  and

consequently convert money or commodities into capital.

    It is therefore impossible for capital to be produced by circulation,

and it is equally impossible for it to originate apart from circulation. It

must have its origin both in circulation and yet not in circulation.

    We have, therefore, got a double result.

    The conversion of money into capital has to be explained on the

basis of the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities, in such a

way that the starting-point is the exchange of equivalents. Our friend,

Moneybags,  who  as  yet  is  only  an  embryo  capitalist,  must  buy  his

commodities at their value, must sell them at their value, and yet at

the end of the process must withdraw more value from circulation than

he threw into it at starting. His development into a full-grown capitalist

must take place, both within the sphere of circulation and without it.

These are the conditions of the problem. Hic Rhodus, hic salta!            Chapter 6: The Buying and Selling of Labor Power



    The change of value that occurs in the case of money intended to

be converted into capital, cannot take place in the money itself, since

in its function of means of purchase and of payment, it does no more

than realize the price of the commodity it buys or pays for; and, as

hard  cash,  it  is  value  petrified,  never  varying.  Just  as  little  can  it

originate in the second act of circulation, the re-sale of the commodity,

which does no more than transform the article from its bodily form

back  again  into  its  money  form.  The  change  must,  therefore,  take

place  in  the  commodity  bought  by  the  first  act,  M-C,  but  not  in  its

value, for equivalents are exchanged, and the commodity is paid for at

its  full  value.  We  are,  therefore,  forced  to  the  conclusion  that  the

change originates in the use value, as such, of the commodity, i.e., in

its  consumption.  In  order  to  be  able  to  extract  value  from  the

consumption  of  a  commodity,  our  friend,  Moneybags,  must  be  so

lucky  as  to  find,  within  the  sphere  of  circulation,  in  the  market,  a

commodity, whose use value possesses the peculiar property of being

a source of value, whose actual consumption, therefore, is itself an

embodiment  of  labor,  and,  consequently,  a  creation  of  value.  The

possessor  of  money  does  find  on  the  market  such  a  special

commodity in capacity for labor or labor power.

    By  labor  power  or  capacity  for  labor  is  to  be  understood  the

aggregate  of  those  mental  and  physical  capabilities  existing  in  a

human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use value

of any description.

    But in order that our owner of money may be able to find labor

power offered for sale as a commodity, various conditions must first

be  fulfilled.  The  exchange  of  commodities  of  itself  implies  no  other

relations of dependence than those which result from its own nature.

On this assumption, labor power can appear upon the market as a

commodity, only if, and so far as, its possessor, the individual whose

labor power it is, offers it for sale, or sells it, as a commodity. In orderthat he may be able to do this, he must have it at his disposal, must be

the untrammeled owner of his capacity for labor, i.e., of his person. He

and the owner of money meet in the market, and deal with each other

as on the basis of equal rights, with this difference alone, that one is

buyer, the other seller; both, therefore, equal in the eyes of the law.

The continuance of this relation demands that the owner of the labor

power should sell it only for a definite period, for if he were to sell it

rump and stump, once for all, he would be selling himself, converting

himself from a free man into a slave, from an owner of a commodity

into a commodity. He must constantly look upon his labor power as his

own property, his own commodity, and this he can only do by placing

it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time.

By this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership

over it.

    The  second  essential  condition  to  the  owner  of  money  finding

labor power in the market as a commodity is this — that the laborer

instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his labor

is incorporated, must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that

very labor power, which exists only in his living self.

    In order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than

labor power, he must of course have the means of production, as raw

material, implements, etc. [...] For the conversion of his money into

capital, therefore, the owner of money must meet in the market with

the free laborer, free in the double sense, that as a free man he can

dispose of his labor power as his own commodity, and that on the

other hand he has no other commodity for sale, is short of everything

necessary for the realization of his labor power [...]

    One thing, however, is clear — Nature does not produce on the

one  side  owners  of  money  or  commodities,  and  on  the  other  men

possessing nothing but their own labor power. This relation has no

natural  basis;  neither  is  its  social  basis  one  that  is  common  to  all

historical  periods.  It  is  clearly  the  result  of  a  past  historical

development,  the  product  of  many  economic  revolutions,  of  the

extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production.

    So, too, the economic categories, already discussed by us, bear

the stamp of history. Definite historical conditions are necessary that a

product may become a commodity. It must not be produced as theimmediate  means  of  subsistence  of  the  producer  himself.  Had  we

gone further, and inquired under what circumstances all, or even the

majority of products take the form of commodities, we should have

found that this can only happen with production of a very specific kind,

capitalist production [...] The appearance of products as commodities

pre-supposes such a development of the social division of labor, that

the separation of use value from exchange value, a separation which

first begins with barter, must already have been completed. But such a

degree of development is common to many forms of society, which in

other  respects  present  the  most  varying  historical  features.  On  the

other  hand,  if  we  consider  money,  its  existence  implies  a  definite

stage in the exchange of commodities.

    The particular functions of money which it performs, either as the

mere equivalent of commodities, or as means of circulation, or means

of payment, as hoard or as universal money, point, according to the

extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other, to

very different stages in the process of social production. Yet we know

by  experience  that  a circulation  of  commodities  relatively  primitive,

suffices for the production of all these forms. Otherwise with capital.

The historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with

the mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring into life,

only  when  the  owner  of  the  means  of  production  and  subsistence

meets in the market with the free laborer selling his labor power. And

this  one  historical  condition  comprises  a  world’s  history.  Capital,

therefore,  announces  from  its  first  appearance  a  new  epoch  in  the

process of social production.

    We  must  now  examine  more  closely  this  peculiar  commodity,

labor  power.  Like  all  others  it  has  a  value.  How  is  that  value

determined?

    The value of labor power is determined, as in the case of every

other commodity, by the labor time necessary for the production, and

consequently also the reproduction, of this special article [...] Labor

power exists only as a capacity, or power of the living individual. Its

production  consequently  pre-supposes  his  existence.  Given  the

individual, the production of labor power consists in his reproduction of

himself or his maintenance. For his maintenance he requires a given

quantity  of  the  means  of  subsistence.  Therefore,  the  labor  timerequisite  for  the  production  of  labor  power  reduces  itself  to  that

necessary for the production of those means of subsistence; in other

words,  the  value  of  labor  power  is  the  value  of  the  means  of

subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the laborer [...] If the

owner of labor power works to-day, to-morrow he must again be able

to repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health

and strength. His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to

maintain him in his normal state as a laboring individual. His natural

wants, such as food, clothing, fuel, and housing, vary according to the

climatic  and  other  physical  conditions  of  his  country.  On  the  other

hand, the number and extent of his so-called necessary wants, as also

the modes of satisfying them, are themselves the product of historical

development  [...]  In  contradistinction  therefore  to  the  case  of  other

commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labor

power  a  historical  and  moral  element.  Nevertheless,  in  a  given

country,  at  a  given  period,  the  average  quantity  of  the  means  of

subsistence necessary for the laborer is practically known.

    The owner of labor power is mortal. If then his appearance in the

market is to be continuous, and the continuous conversion of money

into capital assumes this, the seller of labor power must perpetuate

himself, “in the way that every living individual perpetuates himself, by

procreation” [...] The labor power withdrawn from the market by wear

and tear and death, must be continually replaced by, at the very least,

an equal amount of fresh labor power. Hence the sum of the means of

subsistence necessary for the production of labor power must include

the means necessary for the laborer’s substitutes, i.e., his children, in

order that this race of peculiar commodity owners may perpetuate its

appearance in the market.

    In order to modify the human organism, so that it may acquire skill

and handiness in a given branch of industry, and become labor power

of a special kind, a special education or training is requisite, and this,

on its part, costs an equivalent in commodities of a greater or less

amount. This amount varies according to the more or less complicated

character  of  the  labor  power.  The  expenses  of  this  education

(excessively small in the case of ordinary labor power), enter pro tanto

into the total value spent in its production [...]    Some of the means of subsistence, such as food and fuel, are

consumed daily, and a fresh supply must be provided daily. Others

such as clothes and furniture last for longer periods and require to be

replaced only at longer intervals. One article must be bought or paid

for  daily,  another  weekly,  another  quarterly,  and  so  on.  But  in

whatever way the sum total of these outlays may be spread over the

year, they must be covered by the average income, taking one day

with  another.  If  the  total  of  the  commodities  required  daily  for  the

production of labor power = A, and those required weekly = B, and

those required quarterly = C, and so on, the daily average of these

commodities = (365A + 52B + 4C + etc.) / 365. Suppose that in this

mass  of  commodities  requisite  for  the  average  day  there  are

embodied 6 hours of social labor, then there is incorporated daily in

labor power half a day’s average social labor, in other words, half a

day’s labor is requisite for the daily production of labor power. This

quantity of labor forms the value of a day’s labor power or the value of

the labor power daily reproduced. If half a day’s average social labor

is  incorporated  in  three  shillings,  then  three  shillings  is  the  price

corresponding to the value of a day’s labor power [...]

    The minimum limit of the value of labor power is determined by

the value of the commodities, without the daily supply of which the

laborer cannot renew his vital energy, consequently by the value of

those means of subsistence that are physically indispensable. If the

price of labor power fall to this minimum, it falls below its value, since

under such circumstances it can be maintained and developed only in

a crippled state. But the value of every commodity is determined by

the labor time requisite to turn it out so as to be of normal quality [.]

    When we speak of labor, or capacity for labor, we speak at the

same time of the laborer and his means of subsistence, of laborer and

wages.  When  we  speak  of  capacity  for  labor,  we  do  not  speak  of

labor,  any  more  than  when  we  speak  of  capacity  for  digestion,  we

speak of digestion [...]

    One  consequence  of  the  peculiar  nature  of  labor  power  as  a

commodity is, that its use value does not, on the conclusion of the

contract  between  the  buyer  and  seller,  immediately  pass  into  the

hands of the former. Its value, like that of every other commodity, is

already fixed before it goes into circulation, since a definite quantity ofsocial labor has been spent upon it; but its use value consists in the

subsequent exercise of its force. The alienation of labor power and its

actual appropriation by the buyer, its employment as a use value, are

separated  by  an  interval  of  time.  But  in  those  cases  in  which  the

formal  alienation  by  sale  of  the  use  value  of  a  commodity,  is  not

simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer, the money of the

latter  usually  functions  as  means  of  payment.  In  every  country  in

which the capitalist mode of production reigns, it is the custom not to

pay for labor power before it has been exercised for the period fixed

by the contract, as for example, the end of each week. In all cases,

therefore,  the  use  value  of  the  labor  power  is  advanced  to  the

capitalist:  the  laborer  allows  the  buyer  to  consume  it  before  he

receives  payment  of  the  price;  he  everywhere  gives  credit  to  the

capitalist. That this credit is no mere fiction, is shown not only by the

occasional loss of wages on the bankruptcy of the capitalist, but also

by a series of more enduring consequences. Nevertheless, whether

money serves as a means of purchase or as a means of payment, this

makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities.

The price of the labor power is fixed by the contract, although it is not

realized till later, like the rent of a house [...]

    We  now  know  how  the  value  paid  by  the  purchaser  to  the

possessor of this peculiar commodity, labor power, is determined. The

use value which the former gets in exchange, manifests itself only in

the  actual  utilization,  in  the  consumption  of  the  labor  power.  The

money-owner  buys  everything  necessary  for  this  purpose,  such  as

raw  material,  in  the  market,  and  pays  for  it  at  its  full  value.  The

consumption  of  labor  power  is  at  one  and  the  same  time  the

production of commodities and of surplus value. The consumption of

labor power is completed, as in the case of every other commodity,

outside  the  limits  of  the  market  or  of  the  sphere  of  circulation.

Accompanied  by  Mr.  Moneybags  and  by  the  possessor  of  labor

power, we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere, where

everything  takes  place  on  the  surface  and  in  view  of  all  men,  and

follow  them  both  into  the  hidden  abode  of  production,  on  whose

threshold  there  stares  us  in  the  face  “No  admittance  except  on

business”. Here we shall see, not only how capital produces, but howcapital is produced. We shall at last force the secret of profit making

[...]            PART 3: THE PRODUCTION OF ABSOLUTE

                              SURPLUS VALUE    Chapter 7: The Labor Process and The Process of Producing

                                    Surplus Value



    [.]  Our  capitalist  has  two  objects  in  view:  in  the  first  place,  he

wants to produce a use value that has a value in exchange, that is to

say, an article destined to be sold, a commodity; and secondly, he

desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the

sum of the values of the commodities used in its production, that is, of

the means of production and the labor power, that he purchased with

his good money in the open market. His aim is to produce not only a

use value, but a commodity also; not only use value, but value; not

only value, but at the same time surplus value.

    It  must  be  borne  in  mind,  that  we  are  now  dealing  with  the

production of commodities, and that, up to this point, we have only

considered one aspect of the process. Just as commodities are, at the

same time, use values and values, so the process of producing them

must be a labor process, and at the same time, a process of creating

value.

    Let us now examine production as a creation of value. We know

that  the  value  of  each  commodity  is  determined  by  the  quantity  of

labor  expended  on  and  materialized  in  it,  by  the  working  time

necessary,  under  given  social  conditions,  for  its  production  [...]

Assuming  this  product  to  be  10  lbs.  of  yarn,  our  first  step  is  to

calculate the quantity of labor realized in it. For spinning the yarn, raw

material is required; suppose in this case 10 lbs. of cotton [... We] will

assume,  bought  it  at  its  full  value,  say  of  ten  shillings  [...]  We  will

further assume that the wear and tear of the spindle, which, for our

present  purpose,  may  represent  all  other instruments  of  labor

employed,  amounts  to  the  value  of  2s.  If,  then,  twenty-four  hours’

labor, or two working days, are required to produce the quantity of

gold represented by twelve shillings, we have here, to begin with, two

days’ labor already incorporated in the yarn.

    We must not let ourselves be misled by the circumstance that the

cotton has taken a new shape while the substance of the spindle has

to a certain extent been used up. By the general law of value, if thevalue of 40 lbs. of yarn = the value of 40 lbs. of cotton + the value of a

whole spindle, i. e., if the same working time is required to produce the

commodities on either side of this equation, then 10 lbs. of yarn are an

equivalent for 10 lbs. of cotton, together with one-fourth of a spindle

[...]  The  labor  required  for  the  production  of  the  cotton,  the  raw

material of the yarn, is part of the labor necessary to produce the yarn,

and is therefore contained in the yarn. The same applies to the labor

embodied in the spindle, without whose wear and tear the cotton could

not  be  spun  [...]  The  values  of  the  means  of  production,  i.  e.,  the

cotton  and  the  spindle,  which  values  are  expressed  in  the  price  of

twelve  shillings,  are  therefore  constituent  parts  of  the  value  of  the

yarn, or, in other words, of the value of the product.

    Two conditions must nevertheless be fulfilled. First, the cotton and

spindle must concur in the production of a use value; they must in the

present case become yarn. Value is independent of the particular use

value by which it is borne, but it must be embodied in a use value of

some  kind.  Secondly,  the  time  occupied  in  the  labor  of  production

must  not  exceed  the  time  really  necessary  under  the  given  social

conditions of the case [.]

    We now know what portion of the value of the yarn is owing to the

cotton and the spindle. It amounts to twelve shillings or the value of

two days’ work. The next point for our consideration is, what portion of

the value of the yarn is added to the cotton by the labor of the spinner.

    We have now to consider this labor under a very different aspect

from that which it had during the labor process; there, we viewed it

solely as that particular kind of human activity which changes cotton

into yarn; there, the more the labor was suited to the work, the better

the yarn, other circumstances remaining the same [...] Here, on the

contrary, where we consider the labor of the spinner only so far as it is

value-creating, i.e., a source of value, his labor differs in no respect

from  the  labor  of  the  man  who  bores  cannon,  or  (what  here  more

nearly concerns us), from the labor of the cotton-planter and spindle-

maker  incorporated  in  the  means  of  production  [...]  Here,  we  have

nothing  more  to  do  with  the  quality,  the  nature  and  the  specific

character of the labor, but merely with its quantity. And this simply

requires  to  be  calculated.  We  proceed  upon  the  assumption  thatspinning is simple, unskilled labor, the average labor of a given state

of society [...]

    While  the  laborer  is  at  work,  his  labor  constantly  undergoes  a

transformation:  from  being  motion,  it  becomes  an  object  without

motion;  from  being  the  laborer  working,  it  becomes  the  thing

produced. At the end of one hour’s spinning, that act is represented by

a definite quantity of yarn; in other words, a definite quantity of labor,

namely that of one hour, has become embodied in the cotton. We say

labor, i.e., the expenditure of his vital force by the spinner, and not

spinning labor, because the special work of spinning counts here, only

so far as it is the expenditure of labor power in general, and not in so

far as it is the specific work of the spinner [... The] yarn, is now nothing

more than a measure of the labor absorbed by the cotton. If in one

hour 1 2/3 lbs. of cotton can be spun into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn, then 10

lbs. of yarn indicate the absorption of 6 hours’ labor [.]

    We assumed, on the occasion of its sale, that the value of a day’s

labor power is three shillings, and that six hours’ labor is incorporated

in that sum; and consequently that this amount of labor is requisite to

produce the necessaries of life daily required on an average by the

laborer. If now our spinner by working for one hour, can convert 1 2/3

lbs. of cotton into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn, it follows that in six hours he will

convert  10  lbs.  of  cotton  into  10  lbs.  of  yarn.  Hence,  during  the

spinning  process,  the  cotton  absorbs  six  hours’  labor.  The  same

quantity of labor is also embodied in a piece of gold of the value of

three shillings. Consequently, by the mere labor of spinning, a value of

three shillings is added to the cotton.

    Let us now consider the total value of the product, the 10 lbs. of

yarn. Two and a half days’ labor has been embodied in it, of which two

days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle

worn  away,  and  half  a  day  was  absorbed  during  the  process  of

spinning.  This  two  and  a  half  days’  labor  is  also  represented  by  a

piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings. Hence, fifteen shillings is

an adequate price for the 10 lbs. of yarn [...] The value of the product

is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced. The value so

advanced has not expanded, no surplus value has been created, and

consequently money has not been converted into capital. The price of

the yarn is fifteen shillings, and fifteen shillings were spent in the openmarket  upon  the  constituent  elements  of  the  product,  or,  what

amounts to the same thing, upon the factors of the labor process; ten

shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings for the substance of the

spindle worn away, and three shillings for the labor power [.]

    Let  us  examine  the  matter  more  closely.  The  value  of  a  day’s

labor power amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a

day’s labor is embodied in that quantity of labor power, i.e., because

the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of

labor  power,  cost  half  a  day’s  labor.  But  the  past  labor  that  is

embodied in the labor power, and the living labor that it can call into

action;  the  daily  cost  of  maintaining  it,  and  its  daily  expenditure  in

work,  are  two  totally  different  things.  The  former  determines  the

exchange value of the labor power; the latter is its use value. The fact

that half a day’s labor is necessary to keep the laborer alive during 24

hours, does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day.

Therefore, the value of labor power, and the value which that labor

power  creates  in  the  labor  process,  are  two  entirely  different

magnitudes;  and  this  difference  of  the  two  values  was  what  the

capitalist had in view, when he was purchasing the labor power [...]

What  really  influenced  him  was  the  specific  use  value  which  this

commodity possesses of being a source not only of value, but of more

value than it has itself. This is the special service that the capitalist

expects from labor power [...]

    The use value of labor power, or in other words, labor, belongs

just as little to its seller, as the use value of oil after it has been sold

belongs to the dealer who has sold it. The owner of the money has

paid the value of a day’s labor power; his, therefore, is the use of it for

a day; a day’s labor belongs to him. The circumstance, that on the one

hand the daily sustenance of labor power costs only half a day’s labor,

while on the other hand the very same labor power can work during a

whole day, that consequently the value which its use during one day

creates,  is  double  what  he  pays  for  that  use,  this  circumstance  is,

without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means an

injury to the seller.

    Our capitalist foresaw this state of things, and that was the cause

of  his  laughter.  The  laborer  therefore  finds,  in  the  workshop,  the

means of production necessary for working, not only during six, butduring twelve hours. Just as during the six hours’ process our 10 lbs.

of cotton absorbed six hours’ labor, and became 10 lbs. of yarn, so

now, 20 lbs. of cotton will absorb 12 hours’ labor and be changed into

20  lbs.  of  yarn.  Let  us  now  examine  the  product  of  this  prolonged

process. There is now materialized in this 20 lbs. of yarn the labor of

five days, of which four days are due to the cotton and the lost steel of

the spindle, the remaining day having been absorbed by the cotton

during the spinning process. Expressed in gold, the labor of five days

is  thirty  shillings.  This  is  therefore  the  price  of  the  20  lbs.  of  yarn,

giving, as before, eighteen pence as the price of a pound. But the sum

of  the  values  of  the  commodities  that  entered  into  the  process

amounts  to  27  shillings.  The  value  of  the  yarn  is  30  shillings.

Therefore,  the  value  of  the  product  is  1/9  greater  than  the  value

advanced for its production; 27 shillings have been transformed into

30 shillings; a surplus value of 3 shillings has been created. The trick

has at last succeeded; money has been converted into capital.

    Every  condition  of  the  problem  is  satisfied,  while  the  laws  that

regulate the exchange of commodities, have been in no way violated.

    Equivalent has been exchanged for equivalent. For the capitalist

as buyer paid for each commodity, for the cotton, the spindle and the

labor  power,  its  full  value.  He  then  did  what  is  done  by  every

purchaser  of  commodities;  he  consumed  their  use  value.  The

consumption  of  the  labor  power,  which  was  also  the  process  of

producing commodities, resulted in 20 lbs. of yarn, having a value of

30 shillings. The capitalist, formerly a buyer, now returns to market as

a seller, of commodities. He sells his yarn at eighteen pence a pound,

which is its exact value. Yet for all that he withdraws 3 shillings more

from circulation than he originally threw into it. This metamorphosis,

this  conversion  of  money  into  capital,  takes  place  both  within  the

sphere of circulation and also outside it; within the circulation, because

conditioned by the purchase of the labor power in the market; outside

the circulation, because what is done within it is only a stepping-stone

to the production of surplus value, a process which is entirely confined

to the sphere of production [...]

    The process of production, considered on the one hand as the

unity  of  the  labor  process  and  the  process  of  creating  value,  is

production of commodities; considered on the other hand as the unityof the labor process and the process of producing surplus value, it is

the  capitalist  process  of  production,  or  capitalist  production  of

commodities.

    [... In] the creation of surplus value it does not in the least matter,

whether the labor appropriated by the capitalist be simple unskilled

labor of average quality or more complicated skilled labor [,] labor that

creates in equal times proportionally higher values than unskilled labor

does [, for] in every process of creating value, the reduction of skilled

labor to average social labor, e.g., one day of skilled to six days of

unskilled labor, is unavoidable [...]              Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital



    [...] That part of capital then, which is represented by the means of

production, by the raw material, auxiliary material and the instruments

of  labor  does  not,  in  the  process  of  production,  undergo  any

quantitative alteration of value. I therefore call it the constant part of

capital, or, more shortly, constant capital. On the other hand, that part

of  capital,  represented  by  labor  power,  does,  in  the  process  of

production,  undergo  an  alteration  of  value.  It  both  reproduces  the

equivalent of its own value, and also produces an excess, a surplus

value,  which  may  itself  vary,  may  be  more  or  less  according  to

circumstances.  This  part  of  capital  is  continually  being  transformed

from  a  constant  into  a  variable  magnitude.  I  therefore  call  it  the

variable  part  of  capital,  or,  shortly,  variable  capital.  The  same

elements of capital which, from the point of view of the labor process,

present  themselves  respectively  as  the  objective  and  subjective

factors, as means of production and labor power, present themselves,

from the point of view of the process of creating surplus value, as

constant and variable capital [...]                      Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus Value



    Section 1. The Degree of Exploitation of Labor Power


    The surplus value generated in the process of production by C,

the  capital  advanced,  or  in  other  words,  the  self-expansion  of  the

value of the capital C, presents itself for our consideration, in the first

place, as a surplus, as the amount by which the value of the product

exceeds the value of its constituent elements.

    The capital C is made up of two components, one, the sum of

money c laid out upon the means of production, and the other, the

sum of money v expended upon the labor power; c represents the

portion that has become constant capital, and v the portion that has

become variable capital. At first then, C = c + v: for example, if £500 is

the capital advanced, its components may be such that the £500 =

£410 const. + £90 var. When the process of production is finished, we

get a commodity whose value = (c + v) + s, where s is the surplus

value; or taking our former figures, the value of this commodity may be

(£410 const. + £90 var.) + £90 surpl. The original capital has now

changed from C to C’, from £500 to £590. The difference is s or a

surplus value of £90 [...] The surplus value generated in the process of

production  by  C,  the  capital  advanced,  or  in  other  words,  the  self-

expansion  of  the  value  of  the  capital  C,  presents  itself  for  our

consideration, in the first place, as a surplus, as the amount by which

the value of the product exceeds the value of its constituent elements

[...]

    The relative quantity produced, or the increase per cent of the

variable capital, is determined, it is plain, by the ratio of the surplus

value to the variable capital, or is expressed by s/v. In our example

this  ratio  is  90/90,  which  gives  an  increase  of  100%.  This  relative

increase in the value of the variable capital, or the relative magnitude

of the surplus value, I call, “The rate of surplus value” [.]    [During]  that  portion  of  his  day’s  labor  in  which  [the  laborer]

produces the value of his labor power, say three shillings, he produces

only an equivalent for the value of his labor power already advanced

by  the  capitalist;  the  new  value  created  only  replaces  the  variable

capital advanced. It is owing to this fact, that the production of the new

value of three shillings takes the semblance of a mere reproduction.

That portion of the working day, then, during which this reproduction

takes  place,  I  call  “necessary”  labor  time,  and  the  labor  expended

during that time I call “necessary” labor [...]

    During the second period of the labor process, that in which his

labor  is  no  longer  necessary  labor,  the  workman,  it  is  true,  labors,

expends labor power; but his labor, being no longer necessary labor,

he creates no value for himself. He creates surplus value which, for

the capitalist, has all the charms of a creation out of nothing. This

portion of the working day, I name surplus labor time, and to the labor

expended during that time, I give the name of surplus labor. It is every

bit  as  important,  for  a  correct  understanding  of  surplus  value,  to

conceive it as a mere congelation of surplus labor time, as nothing but

materialized  surplus  labor,  as  it  is,  for  a  proper  comprehension  of

value, to conceive it as a mere congelation of so many hours of labor,

as nothing but materialized labor [...]

    Since, on the one hand, the values of the variable capital and of

the labor power purchased by that capital are equal, and the value of

this labor power determines the necessary portion of the working day;

and since, on the other hand, the surplus value is determined by the

surplus portion of the working day, it follows that surplus value bears

the same ratio to variable capital, that surplus labor does to necessary

labor,  or  in  other  words,  the  rate  of  surplus  value,  s/v  =  (surplus

labor)/(necessary  labor).  Both  ratios,  s/v  and  (surplus  labor)  /

(necessary labor), express the same thing in different ways; in the one

case by reference to materialized, incorporated labor, in the other by

reference to living, fluent labor.

    The rate of surplus value is therefore an exact expression for the

degree of exploitation of labor power by capital, or of the laborer by

the capitalist.

    We assumed in our example, that the value of the product = £410

const. + £90 var. + £90 surpl., and that the capital advanced = £500.Since the surplus value = £90, and the advanced capital = £500, we

[get, as the rate of profit, or s/(c+v),] 18% [...] But in truth, the rate of

surplus value is not equal to [.] s/(c+v), but to s/v: thus it is not 90/500

but 90/90 or 100% [.]


                          [Section 4. Surplus Produce]


    The portion of the product that represents the surplus value [...]

we  call  “surplus  produce”.  Just  as  the  rate  of  surplus  value  is

determined by its relation, not to the sum total of the capital, but to its

variable part; in like manner, the relative quantity of surplus produce is

determined by the ratio that this produce bears, not to the remaining

part of the total product, but to that part of it in which is incorporated

the necessary labor. Since the production of surplus value is the chief

end and aim of capitalist production, it is clear, that the greatness of a

man’s or a nation’s wealth should be measured, not by the absolute

quantity  produced,  but  by  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  surplus

produce.

    The sum of the necessary labor and the surplus labor, i.e., of the

periods of time during which the workman replaces the value of his

labor power, and produces the surplus value, this sum constitutes the

actual time during which he works, i.e., the working day.                            Chapter 10: The Working Day



    Section 1. The Limits of the Working Day


    We started with the supposition that labor power is bought and

sold  at  its  value.  Its  value,  like  that  of  all  other  commodities,  is

determined  by  the  working  time  necessary  to  its  production.  If  the

production of the average daily means of subsistence of the laborer

takes up 6 hours, he must work, on the average, 6 hours every day, to

produce his daily labor power, or to reproduce the value received as

the result of its sale. The necessary part of his working day amounts

to 6 hours, and is, therefore, caeteris paribus, a given quantity. But

with this, the extent of the working day itself is not yet given.

    Let us assume that the line A-----B represents the length of the

necessary working time, say 6 hours. If the labor be prolonged 1, 3, or

6 hours beyond A—B, we have 3 other lines:

 

                Working day I.  Working day II. Working day III.

                            A—B—C. A—B—C. A—B—C.

 

      representing 3 different working days of 7, 9, and 12 hours. The

extension B--C of the line A—B represents the length of the surplus

labor. As the working day is A—B + B—C or A—C, it varies with the

variable quantity B—C. Since A—B is constant, the ratio of B—C to A

—B can always be calculated. In working day I, it is 1/6, in working

day  II,  3/6,  in  working  day  III  6/6  of  A—B.  Since  further  the  ratio

(surplus working time)/ (necessary working time), determines the rate

of the surplus value, the latter is given by the ratio of B--C to A--B. It

amounts in the 3 different working days respectively to 16 2/3, 50 and

100 per cent. On the other hand, the rate of surplus value alone would

not give us the extent of the working day. If this rate, e.g., were 100

per cent., the working day might be of 8, 10, 12, or more hours. It

would  indicate  that  the  2  constituent  parts  of  the  working  day,necessary-labor and surplus labor time, were equal in extent, but not

how long each of these two constituent parts was.

    The working day is thus not a constant, but a variable quantity.

One of its parts, certainly, is determined by the working time required

for the Reproduction of the labor power of the laborer himself. But its

total amount varies with the duration of the surplus labor. The working

day is, therefore, determinable, but is, per se, indeterminate.

    Although the working day is not a fixed, but a fluent quantity, it

can, on the other hand, only vary within certain limits. The minimum

limit  is,  however,  not  determinable;  of  course,  if  we  make  the

extension line B- C or the surplus labor = 0, we have a minimum limit,

i.e., the part of the day which the laborer must necessarily work for his

own maintenance. On the basis of capitalist production, however, this

necessary labor can form a part only of the working day; the working

day itself can never be reduced to this minimum. On the other hand,

the working day has a maximum limit. It cannot be prolonged beyond

a certain point. This maximum limit is conditioned by two things. First,

by  the  physical  bounds  of  labor  power.  Within  the  24  hours  of  the

natural day a man can expend only a definite quantity of his vital force.

A  horse,  in  like  manner,  can  only  work  from  day  to  day,  8  hours.

During part of the day this force must rest, sleep; during another part

the man has to satisfy other physical needs, to feed, wash, and clothe

himself. Besides these purely physical limitations, the extension of the

working  day  encounters  moral  ones.  The  laborer  needs  time  for

satisfying his intellectual and social wants, the extent and number of

which  are  conditioned  by  the  general  state  of  social  advancement.

The variation of the working day fluctuates, therefore, within physical

and social bounds. But both these limiting conditions are of a very

elastic nature, and allow the greatest latitude. So we find working days

of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 hours, i.e., of the most different lengths [...]

    We see then, that, apart from extremely elastic bounds, the nature

of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working

day, no limit to surplus labor. The capitalist maintains his rights as a

purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible,

and to make, whenever possible, two working days out of one. On the

other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to

its consumption by the purchaser, and the laborer maintains his rightas seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite

normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against

right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between

equal rights force decides. Hence is it that in the history of capitalist

production, the determination of what is a working day, presents itself

as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e.,

the class of capitalists, and collective labor, i.e., the working class [...]                  Chapter 11: Rate and Mass of Surplus Value



    In  this  Chapter,  as  hitherto,  the  value  of  labor  power,  and

therefore the part of the working day necessary for the reproduction or

maintenance of that labor power, are supposed to be given, constant

magnitudes.

    This premised, with the rate, the mass is at the same time given

of  the  surplus  value  that  the  individual  laborer  furnishes  to  the

capitalist  in  a  definite  period  of  time.  If,  e.g.,  the  necessary  labor

amounts to 6 hours daily, expressed in a quantum of gold = 3 shillings,

then  3s.  is  the  daily  value  of  one  labor  power  or  the  value  of  the

capital advanced in the buying of one labor power. If, further, the rate

of surplus value be = 100%, this variable capital of 3s. produces a

mass of surplus value of 3s., or the laborer supplies daily a mass of

surplus labor equal to 6 hours.

    But the variable capital of a capitalist is the expression in money

of  the  total  value  of  all  the  labor  powers  that  he  employs

simultaneously. Its value is, therefore, equal to the average value of

one labor power, multiplied by the number of labor powers employed.

With a given value of labor power, therefore, the magnitude of the

variable  capital  varies  directly  as  the  number  of  laborers  employed

simultaneously.  If  the  daily  value  of  one  labor  power  =  3s.,  then  a

capital of 300s. must be advanced in order to exploit daily 100 labor

powers, of n times 3s., in order to exploit daily n labor powers.

    In the same way, if a variable capital of 3s., being the daily value

of one labor power, produce a daily surplus value of 3s., a variable

capital of 300s. will produce a daily surplus value of 300s., and one of

n times 3s. a daily surplus value of n x 3s. The mass of the surplus

value  produced  is  therefore  equal  to  the  surplus  value  which  the

working  day  of  one  laborer  supplies  multiplied  by  the  number  of

laborers employed. But as further the mass of surplus value which a

single  laborer  produces,  the  value  of  labor  power  being  given,  is

determined by the rate of the surplus value, this law follows: the massof the surplus value produced is equal to the amount of the variable

capital  advanced,  multiplied  by  the  rate  of  surplus  value,  in  other

words: it is determined by the compound ratio between the number of

labor powers exploited simultaneously by the same capitalist and the

degree of exploitation of each individual labor power.

    Let the mass of the surplus value be S, the surplus value supplied

by the individual laborer in the average days the variable capital daily

advanced in the purchase of one individual labor power v, the sum

total of the variable capital V, the value of an average labor power P,

its degree of exploitation (a’/a) (surplus labor/necessary-labor) and the

number of laborers employed n; we would have:





    It is always supposed, not only that the value of an average labor

power is constant, but that the laborers employed by a capitalist are

reduced to average laborers. There are exceptional cases in which the

surplus value produced does not increase in proportion to the number

of laborers exploited, but then the value of the labor power does not

remain constant.

    In the production of a definite mass of surplus value, therefore,

the decrease of one factor may be compensated by the increase of

the other. If the variable capital diminishes, and at the same time the

rate of surplus value increases in the same ratio, the mass of surplus

value produced remains unaltered. If on our earlier assumption the

capitalist must advance 300s., in order to exploit 100 laborers a day,

and if the rate of surplus value amounts to 50%, this variable capital of

300s. yields a surplus value of 150s. or of 100 x 3 working hours. If

the rate of surplus value doubles, or the working day, instead of being

extended from 6 to 9, is extended from 6 to 12 hours and at the same

time variable capital is lessened by half, and reduced to 150s., it yields

also a surplus value of 150s. or 50 x 6 working hours. Diminution of

the variable capital may therefore be compensated by a proportionate

rise in the degree of exploitation of labor power, or the decrease in the

number of the laborers employed by a proportionate extension of the

working  day.  Within  certain  limits  therefore  the  supply  of  laborexploitable by capital is independent of the supply of laborers. On the

contrary, a fall in the rate of surplus value leaves unaltered the mass

of the surplus value produced, if the amount of the variable capital, or

number of the laborers employed, increases in the same proportion.

      Nevertheless, the compensation of a decrease in the number of

laborers employed, or of the amount of variable capital advanced by a

rise in the rate of surplus value, or by the lengthening of the working

day, has impassable limits. Whatever the value of labor power may

be, whether the working time necessary for the maintenance of the

laborer is 2 or 10 hours, the total value that a laborer can produce, day

in, day out, is always less than the value in which 24 hours of labor

are embodied, less than 12s., if 12s. is the money expression for 24

hours of realized labor [...] The absolute limit of the average working

day  —  this  being  by  nature  always  less  than  24  hours  —  sets  an

absolute limit to the compensation of a reduction of variable capital by

a higher rate of surplus value, or of the decrease of the number of

laborers exploited by a higher degree of exploitation of labor power.

This  palpable  law  is  of  importance  for  the  clearing  up  of  many

phenomena, arising from a tendency (to be worked out later on) of

capital  to  reduce  as  much  as  possible  the  number  of  laborers

employed  by  it,  or  its  variable  constituent  transformed  into  labor

power, in contradiction to its other tendency to produce the greatest

possible mass of surplus value [.]

    A  third  law  results  from  the  determination,  of  the  mass  of  the

surplus value produced, by the two factors: rate of surplus value and

amount of variable capital advanced [...] The law [...] takes this form:

the  masses  of  value  and  of  surplus  value  produced  by  different

capitals  —  the  value  of  labor  power  being  given  and  its  degree  of

exploitation being equal — vary directly as the amounts of the variable

constituents of these capitals, i.e., as their constituents transformed

into living labor power.

    This law clearly contradicts all experience based on appearance.

Everyone knows that a cotton spinner, who, reckoning the percentage

on the whole of his applied capital, employs much constant and little

variable  capital,  does  not,  on  account  of  this,  pocket  less  profit  or

surplus  value  than  a  baker,  who  relatively  sets  in  motion  much

variable and little constant capital. For the solution of this apparentcontradiction, many intermediate terms are as yet wanted, as from the

standpoint of elementary algebra many intermediate terms are wanted

to understand that 0/0 may represent an actual magnitude [...]        PART 4: PRODUCTION OF RELATIVE SURPLUS

                                        VALUE            Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus Value



    [...]  Hitherto  in  treating  of  surplus  value,  arising  from  a  simple

prolongation  of  the  working  day,  we  have  assumed  the  mode  of

production to be given and invariable. But when surplus value has to

be produced by the conversion of necessary labor into surplus labor, it

by no means suffices for capital to take over the labor process in the

form  under  which  it  has  been  historically  handed  down,  and  then

simply  to  prolong  the  duration  of  that  process.  The  technical  and

social conditions of the process, and consequently the very mode of

production must be revolutionized, before the productiveness of labor

can be increased. By that means alone can the value of labor power

be made to sink, and the portion of the working day necessary for the

reproduction of that value, be shortened.

    The surplus value produced by prolongation of the working day, I

call  absolute  surplus  value.  On  the  other  hand,  the  surplus  value

arising from the curtailment of the necessary labor time, and from the

corresponding  alteration  in  the  respective  lengths  of  the  two

components of the working day, I call relative surplus value.

    In order to effect a fall in the value of labor power, the increase in

the  productiveness  of  labor  must  seize  upon  those  branches  of

industry  whose  products  determine  the  value  of  labor  power,  and

consequently  either  belong  to  the  class  of  customary  means  of

subsistence, or are capable of supplying the place of those means.

But the value of a commodity is determined, not only by the quantity of

labor which the laborer directly bestows upon that commodity, but also

by the labor contained in the means of production. For instance, the

value of a pair of boots depends not only on the cobbler’s labor, but

also on the value of the leather, wax, thread, etc. Hence, a fall in the

value  of  labor  power  is  also  brought  about  by  an  increase  in  the

productiveness  of  labor,  and  by  a  corresponding  cheapening  of

commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of labor

and the raw material, that form the material elements of the constant

capital required for producing the necessaries of life. But an increase

in  the  productiveness  of  labor  in  those  branches  of  industry  whichsupply neither the necessaries of life, nor the means of production for

such necessaries, leaves the value of labor power undisturbed.

    The cheapened commodity, of course, causes only a pro tanto fall

in the value of labor power, a fall proportional to the extent of that

commodity’s employment in the reproduction of labor power. Shirts,

for instance, are a necessary means of subsistence, but are only one

out of many. The totality of the necessaries of life consists, however,

of various commodities, each the product of a distinct industry; and

the value of each of those commodities enters as a component part

into  the  value  of  labor  power.  This  latter  value  decreases  with  the

decrease  of  the  labor  time  necessary  for  its  reproduction;  the  total

decrease being the sum of all the different curtailments of labor time

effected in those various and distinct industries. This general result is

treated, here, as if it were the immediate result directly aimed at in

each  individual  case.  Whenever  an  individual  capitalist  cheapens

shirts, for instance, by increasing the productiveness of labor he by no

means  necessarily  aims  at  reducing  the  value  of  labor  power  and

shortening, pro tanto the necessary labor time. But it is only in so far

as he ultimately contributes to this result, that he assists in raising the

general rate of surplus value [...]

    It is not our intention to consider, here, the way in which the laws,

immanent  in  capitalist  production,  manifest  themselves  in  the

movements  of  individual  masses  of  capital,  where  they  assert

themselves as coercive laws of competition, and are brought home to

the mind and consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing

motives  of  his  operations  [...]  Nevertheless,  for  the  better

comprehension  of  the  production  of  relative  surplus  value,  we  may

add the following remarks, in which we assume nothing more than the

results we have already obtained.

    If one hour’s labor is embodied in sixpence, a value of six shillings

will be produced in a working day of 12 hours. Suppose, that with the

prevailing productiveness of labor, 12 articles are produced in these

12 hours. Let the value of the means of production used up in each

article be sixpence. Under these circumstances, each article costs one

shilling:  sixpence  for  the  value  of  the  means  of  production,  and

sixpence for the value newly added in working with those means. Now

let someone capitalist contrive to double the productiveness of labor,and to produce in the working day of 12 hours, 24 instead of 12 such

articles. The value of the means of production remaining the same,

the value of each article will fall to nine pence, made up of sixpence

for the value of the means of production and three pence for the value

newly  added  by  the  labor.  Despite  the  doubled  productiveness  of

labor, the day’s labor creates, as before, a new value of six shillings

and  no  more,  which,  however,  is  now  spread  over  twice  as  many

articles.  Of  this  value  each  article  now  has  embodied  in  it  1/24th,

instead of 1/12th, three pence instead of sixpence; or, what amounts

to the same thing, only half an hour’s instead of a whole hour’s labor

time, is now added to the means of production while they are being

transformed into each article. The individual value of these articles is

now below their social value; in other words, they have cost less labor

time  than  the  great  bulk  of  the  same  article  produced  under  the

average  social  conditions.  Each  article  costs,  on  an  average,  one

shilling, and represents 2 hours of social labor; but under the altered

mode  of  production  it  costs  only  nine  pence,  or  contains  only  1
                                                                                        1/2

hours’ labor.

    The  real  value  of  a  commodity  is,  however,  not  its  individual

value,  but  its  social  value;  that  is  to  say,  the  real  value  is  not

measured by the labor time that the article in each individual case

costs  the  producer,  but  by  the  labor  time  socially  required  for  its

production. If therefore, the capitalist who applies the new method,

sells his commodity at its social value of one shilling, he sells it for

three  pence  above  its  individual  value,  and  thus  realizes  an  extra

surplus value of three pence. On the other hand, the working day of

12 hours is, as regards him, now represented by 24 articles instead of

12. Hence, in order to get rid of the product of one working day, the

demand must be double what it was, i.e., the market must become

twice  as  extensive.  Other  things  being  equal,  his  commodities  can

command a more extended market only by a diminution of their prices.

He will therefore sell them above their individual but under their social

value, say at ten pence each. By this means he still squeezes an extra

surplus value of one penny out of each. This augmentation of surplus

value is pocketed by him, whether his commodities belong or not to

the  class  of  necessary  means  of  subsistence  that  participate  in

determining the general value of labor power. Hence, independently ofthis latter circumstance, there is a motive for each individual capitalist

to  cheapen  his  commodities,  by  increasing  the  productiveness  of

labor.

      Nevertheless,  even  in  this  case,  the  increased  production  of

surplus value arises from the curtailment of the necessary labor time,

and from the corresponding prolongation of the surplus labor. Let the

necessary labor time amount to 10 hours, the value of a day’s labor

power to five shillings, the surplus labor time to 2 hours, and the daily

surplus value to one shilling.

    But the capitalist now produces 24 articles, which he sells at ten

pence a-piece, making twenty shillings in all. Since the value of the

means of production is twelve shillings, 14 2/5 of these articles merely

replace  the  constant  capital  advanced.  The  labor  of  the  12  hours’

working day is represented by the remaining 9 3/5 articles. Since the

price  of  the  labor  power  is  five  shillings,  6  articles  represent  the

necessary labor time, and 3 3/5 articles the surplus labor. The ratio of

the necessary labor to the surplus labor, which under average social

conditions was 5:1, is now only 5:3. The same result may be arrived at

in the following way. The value of the product of the working day of 12

hours is twenty shillings. Of this sum, twelve shillings belong to the

value  of  the  means  of  production,  a  value  that  merely  re-appears.

There remain eight shillings, which are the expression in money, of

the value newly created during the working day. This sum is greater

than  the  sum  in  which  average  social  labor  of  the  same  kind  is

expressed:  twelve  hours  of  the  latter  labor  are  expressed  by  six

shillings  only.  The  exceptionally  productive  labor  operates  as

intensified labor; it creates in equal periods of time greater values than

average social labor of the same kind. But our capitalist still continues

to pay as before only five shillings as the value of a day’s labor power.

Hence, instead of 10 hours, the laborer need now work only 7 hours,
                                                                                1/2

in  order  to  reproduce  this  value.  His  surplus  labor  is,  therefore,

increased by 2 hours, and the surplus value he produces grows from
                  1/2

one, into three shillings.

    Hence,  the  capitalist  who  applies  the  improved  method  of

production,  appropriates  to  surplus  labor  a  greater  portion  of  the

working day, than the other capitalists in the same trade. He does

individually, what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producingrelative surplus value, do collectively. On the other hand, however,

this  extra  surplus  value  vanishes,  so  soon  as  the  new  method  of

production  has  become  general,  and  has  consequently  caused  the

difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity

and its social value to vanish. The law of the determination of value by

labor time, a law which brings under its sway the individual capitalist

who applies the new method of production, by compelling him to sell

his goods under their social value, this same law, acting as a coercive

law of competition, forces his competitors to adopt the new method.

The general rate of surplus value is, therefore, ultimately affected by

the whole process, only when the increase in the productiveness of

labor,  has  seized  upon  those  branches  of  production  that  are

connected with, and has cheapened those commodities that form part

of, the necessary means of subsistence, and are therefore elements

of the value of labor power.

    The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness

of labor. And so, too, is the value of labor power, because it depends

on  the  values  of  commodities.  Relative  surplus  value  is,  on  the

contrary, directly proportional to that productiveness. It rises with rising

and  falls  with  falling  productiveness.  The  value  of  money  being

assumed to be constant, an average social working day of 12 hours

always produces the same new value, six shillings, no matter how this

sum may be apportioned between surplus value and wages. But if, in

consequence  of  increased  productiveness,  the  value  of  the

necessaries of life fall, and the value of a day’s labor power be thereby

reduced from five shillings to three, the surplus value increases from

one shilling to three. Ten hours were necessary for the reproduction of

the value of the labor power; now only six are required. Four hours

have been set free, and can be annexed to the domain of surplus

labor. Hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant

tendency, to heighten the productiveness of labor, in order to cheapen

commodities, and by such cheapening to cheapen the laborer himself.

    The  value  of  a  commodity  is,  in  itself,  of  no  interest  to  the

capitalist. What alone interests him, is the surplus value that dwells in

it,  and  is  realizable  by  sale.  Realization  of  the  surplus  value

necessarily  carries  with  it  the  refunding  of  the  value  that  was

advanced.  Now,  since  relative  surplus  value  increases  in  directproportion to the development of the productiveness of labor, while, on

the  other  hand,  the  value  of  commodities  diminishes  in  the  same

proportion; since one and the same process cheapens commodities,

and augments the surplus value contained in them; we have mere the

solution of the riddle: why does the capitalist, whose sole concern is

the  production  of  exchange  value,  continually  strive  to  depress  the

exchange value of commodities? [...]

    The shortening of the working day is, therefore, by no means what

is  aimed  at,  in  capitalist  production,  when  labor  is  economized  by

increasing  its  productiveness.  It  is  only  the  shortening  of  the  labor

time,  necessary  for  the  production  of  a  definite  quantity  of

commodities, that is aimed at. The fact that the workman, when the

productiveness  of  his  labor  has  been  increased,  produces,  say  10

times as many commodities as before, and thus spends one-tenth as

much labor time on each, by no means prevents him from continuing

to  work  12  hours  as  before,  nor  from  producing  in  those  12  hours

1,200  articles  instead  of  120.  Nay,  more,  his  working  day  may  be

prolonged at the same time, so as to make him produce, say 1,400

articles in 14 hours. In the treatises, therefore, of economists of the

stamp of MacCulloch, Ure, Senior, and tutti quanti, we may read upon

one  page,  that  the  laborer  owes  a  debt  of  gratitude  to  capital  for

developing his productiveness, because the necessary labor time is

thereby  shortened,  and  on  the  next  page,  that  he  must  prove  his

gratitude by working in future for 15 hours instead of 10. The object of

all  development  of  the  productiveness  of  labor,  within  the  limits  of

capitalist production, is to shorten that part of the working day, during

which the workman must labor for his own benefit, and by that very

shortening, to lengthen the other part of the day, during which he is at

liberty  to  work  gratis  for  the  capitalist.  How  far  this  result  is  also

attainable,  without  cheapening  commodities,  will  appear  from  an

examination  of  the  particular  modes  of  producing  relative  surplus

value, to which examination we now proceed.                              Chapter 13: Co-Operation



    Capitalist production only then really begins, as we have already

seen,  when  each  individual  capital  employs  simultaneously  a

comparatively large number of laborers; when consequently the labor

process is carried on an extensive scale and yields, relatively, large

quantities of products. A greater number of laborers working together,

at the same time, in one place (or, if you will, in the same field of

labor),  in  order  to  produce  the  same  sort  of  commodity  under  the

mastership of one capitalist, constitutes, both historically and logically,

the starting-point of capitalist production. With regard to the mode of

production  itself,  manufacture,  in  its  strict  meaning,  is  hardly  to  be

distinguished, in its earliest stages, from the handicraft trades of the

guilds,  otherwise  than  by  the  greater  number  of  workmen

simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital. The

workshop of the medieval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged.

    At first, therefore, the difference is purely quantitative. We have

shown that the surplus value produced by a given capital is equal to

the  surplus  value  produced  by  each  workman  multiplied  by  the

number  of  workmen  simultaneously  employed.  The  number  of

workmen in itself does not affect, either the rate of surplus value, or

the degree of exploitation of labor power. If a working day of 12 hours

be  embodied  in  six  shillings,  1.200  such  days  will  be  embodied  in

1,200 times 6 shillings. In one case 12 x 1.200 working hours, and in

the  other  12  such  hours  are  incorporated  in  the  product.  In  the

production of value, a number of workmen rank merely as so many

individual workmen; and it therefore makes no difference in the value

produced whether the 1,200 men work separately, or united under the

control of one capitalist.

      Nevertheless, within certain limits, a modification takes place. The

labor  realized  in  value,  is  labor  of  an  average  social  quality;  is

consequently the expenditure of average labor power. Any average

magnitude, however, is merely the average of a number of separatemagnitudes  all  of  one  kind,  but  differing  as  to  quantity.  In  every

industry, each individual laborer, be he Peter or Paul, differs from the

average laborer. These individual differences, or “errors” as they are

called  in  mathematics,  compensate  one  another,  and  vanish,

whenever  a  certain  minimum  number  of  workmen  are  employed

together  [...  It]  is  clear,  that  the  collective  working  day  of  a  large

number of workmen simultaneously employed, divided by the number

of  these  workmen,  gives  one  day  of  average  social  labor.  For

example, let the working day of each individual be 12 hours. Then the

collective working day of 12 men simultaneously employed, consists

of 144 hours; and although the labor of each of the dozen men may

deviate more or less from average social labor, each of them requiring

a different time for the same operation, yet since the working day of

each  is  one-twelfth  of  the  collective  working  day  of  144  hours,  it

possesses the qualities of an average social working day [...]

    Even  without  an  alteration  in  the  system  of  working,  the

simultaneous  employment  of  a  large  number  of  laborers  effects  a

revolution  in  the  material  conditions  of  the  labor  process.  The

buildings in which they work, the store-houses for the raw material, the

implements  and  utensils  used  simultaneously  or  in  turns  by  the

workmen;  in  short,  a  portion  of  the  means  of  production,  are  now

consumed in common. On the one hand, the exchange value of these

means  of  production  is  not  increased;  for  the  exchange  value  of  a

commodity  is  not  raised  by  its  use  value  being  consumed  more

thoroughly  and  to  greater  advantage.  On  the  other  hand,  they  are

used in common, and therefore on a larger scale than before. A room

where twenty weavers work at twenty looms must be larger than the

room of a single weaver with two assistants. But it costs less labor to

build  one  workshop  for  twenty  persons  than  to  build  ten  to

accommodate  two  weavers  each;  thus  the  value  of  the  means  of

production that are concentrated for use in common on a large scale

does  not  increase  in  direct  proportion  to  the  expansion  and  to  the

increased useful effect of those means. When consumed in common,

they give up a smaller part of their value to each single product; partly

because the total value they part with is spread over a greater quantity

of products, and partly because their value, though absolutely greater,

is, having regard to their sphere of action in the process, relatively lessthan  the  value  of  isolated  means  of  production.  Owing  to  this,  the

value of a part of the constant capital falls, and in proportion to the

magnitude of the fall, the total value of the commodity also falls. The

effect is the same as if the means of production had cost less. The

economy in their application is entirely owing to their being consumed

in common by a large number of workmen [.]

    Economy  in  the  use  of  the  means  of  production  has  to  be

considered under two aspects. First, as cheapening commodities, and

thereby bringing about a fall in the value of labor power. Secondly, as

altering the ratio of the surplus value to the total capital advanced, i.e.,

to the sum of the values of the constant and variable capital. The latter

aspect will not be considered until we come to the third book, to which,

with  the  object  of  treating  them  in  their  proper  connexion,  we  also

relegate many other points that relate to the present question [...]

    When numerous laborers work together side by side, whether in

one and the same process, or in different but connected processes,

they are said to co-operate, or to work in co-operation.

    Just  as  the  offensive  power  of  a  squadron  of  cavalry,  or  the

defensive power of a regiment of infantry is essentially different from

the sum of the offensive or defensive powers of the individual cavalry

or  infantry  soldiers  taken  separately,  so  the  sum  total  of  the

mechanical forces exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social

force that is developed, when many hands take part simultaneously in

one  and  the  same  undivided  operation,  such  as  raising  a  heavy

weight, turning a winch, or removing an obstacle [...]

    Apart  from  the  new  power  that  arises  from  the  fusion  of  many

forces  into  one  single  force,  mere  social  contact  begets  in  most

industries  an  emulation  and  a  stimulation  of  the  animal  spirits  that

heighten the efficiency of each individual workman [.]

    The combined working day produces, relatively to an equal sum

of  isolated  working  days,  a  greater  quantity  of  use  values,  and,

consequently, diminishes the labor time necessary for the production

of a given useful effect. Whether the combined working day, in a given

case, acquires this increased productive power, because it heightens

the mechanical force of labor, or extends its sphere of action over a

greater  space,  or  contracts  the  field  of  production  relatively  to  the

scale of production, or at the critical moment sets large masses oflabor  to  work,  or  excites  emulation  between  individuals  and  raises

their animal spirits, or impresses on the similar operations carried on

by a number of men the stamp of continuity and many-sidedness, or

performs  simultaneously  different  operations,  or  economizes  the

means of production by use in common, or lends to individual labor

the character of average social labor whichever of these be the cause

of the increase, the special productive power of the combined working

day is, under all circumstances, the social productive power of labor,

or  the  productive  power  of  social  labor.  This  power  is  due  to  co-

operation  itself.  When  the  laborer  co-operates  systematically  with

others, he strips off the fetters of his individuality, and develops the

capabilities of his species [.]

    [Concentration] of large masses of the means of production in the

hands  of  individual  capitalists,  is  a  material  condition  for  the  co-

operation of wage laborers, and the extent of the co-operation or the

scale of production, depends on the extent of this concentration.

    We saw in a former Chapter, that a certain minimum amount of

capital  was  necessary,  in  order  that  the  number  of  laborers

simultaneously employed, and, consequently, the amount of surplus

value produced, might suffice to liberate the employer himself from

manual labor, to convert him from a small master into a capitalist, and

thus  formally  to  establish  capitalist  production.  We  now  see  that  a

certain minimum amount is a necessary condition for the conversion

of numerous isolated and independent processes into one combined

social process.

    We also saw that at first, the subjection of labor to capital was

only a formal result of the fact, that the laborer, instead of working for

himself, works for and consequently under the capitalist. By the co-

operation of numerous wage laborers, the sway of capital develops

into  a  requisite  for  carrying  on  the  labor  process  itself,  into  a  real

requisite of production. That a capitalist should command on the field

of  production,  is  now  as  indispensable  as  that  a  general  should

command on the field of battle.

    All  combined  labor  on  a  large  scale  requires,  more  or  less,  a

directing authority, in order to secure the harmonious working of the

individual activities [...] A single violin player is his own conductor; an

orchestra  requires  a  separate  one.  The  work  of  directing,superintending,  and  adjusting,  becomes  one  of  the  functions  of

capital, from the moment that the labor under the control of capital,

becomes co-operative. Once a function of capital, it acquires special

characteristics.

    The directing motive, the end and aim of capitalist production, is

to  extract  the  greatest  possible  amount  of  surplus  value,  and

consequently to exploit labor power to the greatest possible extent. As

the number of the co-operating laborers increases, so too does their

resistance to the domination of capital, and with it, the necessity for

capital to overcome this resistance by counter pressure [...] Just as at

first the capitalist is relieved from actual labor so soon as his capital

has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist production, as

such, begins, so now, he hands over the work of direct and constant

supervision of the individual workmen, and groups of workmen, to a

special kind of wage laborer. An industrial army of workmen, under the

command  of  a  capitalist,  requires,  like  a  real  army,  officers

(managers),  and  sergeants  (foremen,  over  lookers),  who,  while  the

work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist. The work

of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function [.]

    The  laborer  is  the  owner  of  his  labor  power  until  he  has  done

bargaining for its sale with the capitalist; and he can sell no more than

what he has — i.e., his individual, isolated labor power. This state of

things is in no way altered by the fact that the capitalist, instead of

buying the labor power of one man, buys that of 100, and enters into

separate contracts with 100 unconnected men instead of with one. He

is  at  liberty  to  set  the  100  men  to  work,  without  letting  them  co-

operate. He pays them the value of 100 independent labor powers,

but he does not pay for the combined labor power of the hundred.

Being independent of each other, the laborers are isolated persons,

who enter into relations with the capitalist, but not with one another.

This co-operation begins only with the labor process, but they have

then ceased to belong to themselves. On entering that process, they

become incorporated with capital. As co-operators, as members of a

working organism, they are but special modes of existence of capital.

Hence, the productive power developed by the laborer when working

in  co-operation,  is  the  productive  power  of  capital.  This  power  is

developed  gratuitously,  whenever  the  workmen  are  placed  undergiven  conditions,  and  it  is  capital  that  places  them  under  such

conditions. Because this power costs capital nothing, and because, on

the other hand, the laborer himself does not develop it before his labor

belongs  to  capital,  it  appears  as  a  power  with  which  capital  is

endowed by Nature — a productive power that is immanent in capital

[...]

    Co-operation,  such  as  we  find  it  at  the  dawn  of  human

development,  among  races  who  live  by  the  chase,  or,  say,  in  the

agriculture  of  Indian  communities,  is  based,  on  the  one  hand,  on

ownership in common of the means of production, and on the other

hand, on the fact, that in those cases, each individual has no more

torn himself off from the navel-string of his tribe or community, than

each  bee  has  freed  itself  from  connexion  with  the  hive.  Such  co-

operation is distinguished from capitalistic co-operation by both of the

above characteristics. The sporadic application of co-operation on a

large  scale  in  ancient  times,  in  the  Middle  Ages,  and  in  modern

colonies, reposes on relations of dominion and servitude, principally

on slavery. The capitalistic form, on the contrary, pre-supposes from

first to last, the free wage laborer, who sells his labor power to capital

[.]

    Just as the social productive power of labor that is developed by

co-operation, appears to be the productive power of capital, so co-

operation itself, contrasted with the process of production carried on

by  isolated  independent  laborers,  or  even  by  small  employers,

appears to be a specific form of the capitalist process of production. It

is  the  first  change  experienced  by  the  actual  labor  process,  when

subjected  to  capital.  This  change  takes  place  spontaneously.  The

simultaneous employment of a large number of wage laborers, in one

and the same process, which is a necessary condition of this change,

also  forms  the  starting-point  of  capitalist  production.  This  point

coincides with the birth of capital itself. If then, on the one hand, the

capitalist  mode  of  production  presents  itself  to  us  historically,  as  a

necessary condition to the transformation of the labor process into a

social process, so, on the other hand, this social form of the labor

process presents itself, as a method employed by capital for the more

profitable  exploitation  of  labor,  by  increasing  that  labor’s

productiveness.    In the elementary form, under which we have hitherto viewed it,

co-operation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large

scale, but it does not, in itself, represent a fixed form characteristic of

a  particular  epoch  in  the  development  of  the  capitalist  mode  of

production.  At  the  most  it  appears  to  do  so,  and  that  only

approximately, in the handicraft-like beginnings of manufacture, and in

that  kind  of  agriculture  on  a  large  scale,  which  corresponds  to  the

epoch of manufacture, and is distinguished from peasant agriculture,

mainly by the number of the laborers simultaneously employed, and

by the mass of the means of production concentrated for their use.

Simple co-operation is always the prevailing form, in those branches

of production in which capital operates on a large scale, and division

of labor and machinery play but a subordinate part.

    Co-operation  ever  constitutes  the  fundamental  form  of  the

capitalist mode of production, nevertheless the elementary form of co-

operation  continues  to  subsist  as  a  particular  form  of  capitalist

production side by side with the more developed forms of that mode of

production.              Chapter 14: Division of Labor and Manufacture



    Section 1. Twofold Origin of Manufacture


    That co-operation which is based on division of labor, assumes its

typical form in manufacture, and is the prevalent characteristic form of

the  capitalist  process  of  production  throughout  the  manufacturing

period properly so called. That period, roughly speaking, extends from

the middle of the 16th to the last third of the 18th century.

      Manufacture takes its rise in two ways:

    (1.) By the assemblage, in one workshop under the control of a

single  capitalist,  of  laborers  belonging  to  various  independent

handicrafts, but through whose hands a given article must pass on its

way to completion. A carriage, for example, was formerly the product

of  the  labor  of  a  great  number  of  independent  artificers,  such  as

wheelwrights,  harness-makers,  tailors,  locksmiths,  upholsterers,

turners, fringe-makers, glaziers, painters, polishers, gilders, etc. In the

manufacture  of  carriages,  however,  all  these  different  artificers  are

assembled in one building where they work into one another’s hands

[... Soon] an important change takes place. The tailor, the locksmith,

and the other artificers, being now exclusively occupied in carriage-

making, each gradually loses, through want of practice, the ability to

carry on, to its full extent, his old handicraft. But, on the other hand,

his  activity  now  confined  in  one  groove,  assumes  the  form  best

adapted  to  the  narrowed  sphere  of  action.  At  first,  carriage

manufacture is a combination of various independent handicrafts. By

degrees, it becomes the splitting up of carriage-making into its various

detail processes, each of which crystallizes into the exclusive function

of a particular workman, the manufacture, as a whole, being carried

on by the men in conjunction. In the same way, cloth manufacture, as

also  a  whole  series  of  other  manufactures,  arose  by  combining

different handicrafts together under the control of a single capitalist.    (2.) Manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of this —

namely, by one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a

number of artificers, who all do the same, or the same kind of work,

such as making paper, type, or needles. This is co-operation in its

most elementary form. Each of these artificers (with the help, perhaps,

of  one  or  two  apprentices),  makes  the  entire  commodity,  and  he

consequently performs in succession all the operations necessary for

its production. He still works in his old handicraft-like way. But very

soon external circumstances cause a different use to be made of the

concentration  of  the  workmen  on  one  spot,  and  of  the

simultaneousness of their work. An increased quantity of the article

has perhaps to be delivered within a given time. The work is therefore

re-distributed. Instead of each man being allowed to perform all the

various operations in succession, these operations are changed into

disconnected, isolated ones, carried on side by side; each is assigned

to a different artificer, and the whole of them together are performed

simultaneously  by  the  co-operating  workmen.  This  accidental

repartition  gets  repeated,  develops  advantages  of  its  own,  and

gradually ossifies into a systematic division of labor. The commodity,

from being the individual product of an independent artificer, becomes

the social product of a union of artificers, each of whom performs one,

and only one, of the constituent partial operations [...]

    The  mode  in  which  manufacture  arises,  its  growth  out  of

handicrafts, is therefore two-fold. On the one hand, it arises from the

union of various independent handicrafts, which become stripped of

their  independence  and  specialized  to  such  an  extent  as  to  be

reduced to mere supplementary partial processes in the production of

one particular commodity. On the other hand, it arises from the co-

operation  of  artificers  of  one  handicraft;  it  splits  up  that  particular

handicraft  into  its  various  detail  operations,  isolating,  and  making

these operations independent of one another up to the point where

each becomes the exclusive function of a particular laborer. On the

one hand, therefore, manufacture either introduces division of labor

into a process of production, or further develops that division; on the

other hand, it unites together handicrafts that were formerly separate

[.]    For a proper understanding of the division of labor in manufacture,

it  is  essential  that  the  following  points  be  firmly  grasped.  First,  the

decomposition of a process of production into its various successive

steps coincides, here, strictly with the resolution of a handicraft into its

successive  manual  operations.  Whether  complex  or  simple,  each

operation  has  to  be  done  by  hand,  retains  the  character  of  a

handicraft,  and  is  therefore  dependent  on  the  strength,  skill,

quickness, and sureness, of the individual workman in handling his

tools. The handicraft continues to be the basis. This narrow technical

basis excludes a really scientific analysis of any definite process of

industrial production [...]



    Section 2. The Detail Laborer and His Implements


    If we now go more into detail, it is, in the first place, clear that a

laborer who all his life performs one and the same simple operation,

converts his whole body into the automatic, specialized implement of

that operation. Consequently, he takes less time in doing it, than the

artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession [.]

    An artificer, who performs one after another the various fractional

operations  in  the  production  of  a  finished  article,  must  at  one  time

change  his  place,  at  another  his  tools.  The  transition  from  one

operation to another interrupts the flow of his labor, and creates, so to

say, gaps in his working day. These gaps close up so soon as he is

tied  to  one  and  the  same  operation  all  day  long;  they  vanish  in

proportion  as  the  changes  in  his  work  diminish.  The  resulting

increased  productive  power  is  owing  either  to  an  increased

expenditure of labor power in a given time i.e., to increased intensity

of labor or to a decrease in the amount of labor power unproductively

consumed.  The  extra  expenditure  of  power,  demanded  by  every

transition  from  rest  to  motion,  is  made  up  for  by  prolonging  the

duration  of  the  normal  velocity  when  once  acquired.  On  the  other

hand, constant labor of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and

flow  of  a  man’s  animal  spirits,  which  find  recreation  and  delight  in

mere change of activity.    The productiveness of labor depends not only on the proficiency

of the workman, but on the perfection of his tools [...] Manufacture is

characterized by the differentiation of the instruments of labor — a

differentiation  whereby  implements  of  a  given  sort  acquire  fixed

shapes,  adapted  to  each  particular  application,  and  by  the

specialization of those instruments, giving to each special implement

its  full  play  only  in  the  hands  of  a  specific  detail  laborer  [...]  The

manufacturing  period  simplifies,  improves,  and  multiplies  the

implements  of  labor,  by  adapting  them  to  the  exclusively  special

functions of each detail laborer. It thus creates at the same time one of

the material conditions for the existence of machinery, which consists

of a combination of simple instruments.

    The detail laborer and his implements are the simplest elements

of manufacture. Let us now turn to its aspect as a whole.



    Section  3.  The  Two  Fundamental  Forms  of  Manufacture:

Heterogeneous Manufacture, Serial Manufacture


    The  organization  of  manufacture  has  two  fundamental  forms

which, in spite of occasional blending, are essentially different in kind,

and,  moreover,  play  very  distinct  parts  in  the  subsequent

transformation  of  manufacture  into  modern  industry  carried  on  by

machinery. This double character arises from the nature of the article

produced. This article either results from the mere mechanical fitting

together  of  partial  products  made  independently,  or  owes  its

completed  shape  to  a  series  of  connected  processes  and

manipulations.

    A  locomotive,  for  instance,  consists  of  more  than  5,000

independent parts. It cannot, however, serve as an example of the first

kind of genuine manufacture, for it is a structure produced by modern

mechanical industry. But a watch can; and William Petty used it to

illustrate the division of labor in manufacture. Formerly the individual

work of a Nuremberg artificer, the watch has been transformed into

the social product of an immense number of detail laborers [...]

    The  second  kind  of  manufacture,  its  perfected  form,  produces

articles that go through connected phases of development, through aseries of processes step by step, like the wire in the manufacture of

needles, which passes through the hands of 72 and sometimes even

92 different detail workmen.

    In  so  far  as  such  a  manufacture,  when  first  started,  combines

scattered  handicrafts,  it  lessens  the  space  by  which  the  various

phases of production are separated from each other. The time taken

in passing from one stage to another is shortened, so is the labor that

effectuates this passage. In comparison with a handicraft, productive

power is gained, and this gain is owing to the general co-operative

character of manufacture. On the other hand, division of labor, which

is the distinguishing principle of manufacture, requires the isolation of

the  various  stages  of  production  and  their  independence  of  each

other. The establishment and maintenance of a connexion between

the  isolated  functions  necessitates  the  incessant  transport  of  the

article from one hand to another, and from one process to another.

From  the  standpoint  of  modern  mechanical  industry,  this  necessity

stands forth as a characteristic and costly disadvantage, and one that

is immanent in the principle of manufacture.

    If we confine our attention to some particular lot of raw materials,

of  rags,  for  instance,  in  paper  manufacture,  or  of  wire  in  needle

manufacture,  we  perceive  that  it  passes  in  succession  through  a

series  of  stages  in  the  hands  of  the  various  detail  workmen  until

completion. On the other hand, if we look at the workshop as a whole,

we see the raw material in all the stages of its production at the same

time. The collective laborer, with one set of his many hands armed

with one kind of tools, draws the wire, with another set, armed with

different tools, he, at the same time, straightens it, with another, he

cuts  it,  with  another,  points  it,  and  so  on.  The  different  detail

processes,  which  were  successive  in  time,  have  become

simultaneous, go on side by side in space. Hence, production of a

greater quantum of finished commodities in a given time [...] It is clear

that  this  direct  dependence  of  the  operations,  and  therefore  of  the

laborers, on each other, compels each one of them to spend on his

work  no  more  than  the  necessary  time,  and  thus  a  continuity,

uniformity,  regularity,  order,  and  even  intensity  of  labor,  of  quite  a

different  kind,  is  begotten  than  is  to  be  found  in  an  independent

handicraft or even in simple co-operation [...]    Different  operations  take,  however,  unequal  periods,  and  yield

therefore, in equal times unequal quantities of fractional products. If,

therefore, the same laborer has, day after day, to perform the same

operation,  there  must  be  a  different  number  of  laborers  for  each

operation; for instance, in type manufacture, there are four founders

and two breakers to one rubber: the founder casts 2,000 type an hour,

the breaker breaks up 4,000, and the rubber polishes 8,000. Here we

have  again  the  principle  of  co-operation  in  its  simplest  form,  the

simultaneous employment of many doing the same thing; only now,

this principle is the expression of an organic relation [...]

    Finally, just as manufacture arises in part from the combination of

various handicrafts, so, too, it develops into a combination of various

manufactures. The larger English glass manufacturers, for instance,

make their own earthenware melting-pots, because, on the quality of

these depends, to a great extent, the success or failure of the process.

The manufacture of one of the means of production is here united with

that of the product [...] The various manufactures so combined form

more or less separate departments of a larger manufacture, but are at

the same time independent processes, each with its own division of

labor. In spite of the many advantages offered by this combination of

manufactures, it never grows into a complete technical system on its

own  foundation.  That  happens  only  on  its  transformation  into  an

industry carried on by machinery.

    Early in the manufacturing period, the principle of lessening the

necessary labor time in the production of commodities, was accepted

and formulated: and the use of machines, especially for certain simple

first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale, and

with the application of great force, sprang up here and there [...] The

Roman  Empire  had  handed  down  the  elementary  form  of  all

machinery in the water-wheel.

    The handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the

compass, of gunpowder, of type-printing, and of the automatic clock.

But,  on  the  whole,  machinery  played  that  subordinate  part  which

Adam Smith assigns to it in comparison with division of labor. The

sporadic  use  of  machinery  in  the  17th  century  was  of  the  greatest

importance, because it supplied the great mathematicians of that timewith a practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of

mechanics.

    The collective laborer, formed by the combination of a number of

detail  laborers,  is  the  machinery  especially  characteristic  of  the

manufacturing  period  [...]  After  manufacture  has  once  separated,

made independent, and isolated the various operations, the laborers

are divided, classified, and grouped according to their predominating

qualities.  If  their  natural  endowments  are,  on  the  one  hand,  the

foundation on which the division of labor is built up, on the other hand,

manufacture, once introduced, develops in them new powers that are

by nature fitted only for limited and special functions. The collective

laborer  now  possesses,  in  an  equal  degree  of  excellence,  all  the

qualities  requisite  for  production,  and  expends  them  in  the  most

economical  manner,  by  exclusively  employing  all  his  organs,

consisting of particular laborers, or groups of laborers, in performing

their special functions. The one-sidedness and the deficiencies of the

detail laborer become perfections when he is a part of the collective

laborer. The habit of doing only one thing converts him into a never

failing  instrument,  while  his  connexion  with  the  whole  mechanism

compels him to work with the regularity of the parts of a machine.

    Since  the  collective  laborer  has  functions,  both  simple  and

complex, both high and low, his members, the individual labor powers,

require different degrees of training, and must therefore have different

values. manufacture, therefore, develops a hierarchy of labor powers,

to which there corresponds a scale of wages [...] Hence, manufacture

begets, in every handicraft that it seizes upon, a class of so-called

unskilled laborers, a class which handicraft industry strictly excluded.

If it develops a one-sided specialty into a perfection, at the expense of

the  whole  of  a  man’s  working  capacity,  it  also  begins  to  make  a

specialty  of  the  absence  of  all  development.  Alongside  of  the

hierarchic gradation there steps the simple separation of the laborers

into skilled and unskilled [.]



    Section 4. Division of Labor in Manufacture, And Division of

Labor in Society    We  first  considered  the  origin  of  manufacture,  then  its  simple

elements, then the detail laborer and his implements, and finally, the

totality of the mechanism. We shall now lightly touch upon the relation

between the division of labor in manufacture, and the social division of

labor, which forms the foundation of all production of commodities.

    If we keep labor alone in view, we may designate the separation

of  social  production  into  its  main  divisions  or genera  —  viz.,

agriculture,  industries,  etc.,  as  division  of  labor  in  general,  and  the

splitting up of these families into species and sub-species, as division

of labor in particular, and the division of labor within the workshop as

division of labor in singular or in detail.

    Division of labor in a society, and the corresponding tying down of

individuals  to  a  particular  calling,  develops  itself,  just  as  does  the

division of labor in manufacture, from opposite starting-points. Within a

family, and after further development within a tribe, there springs up

naturally a division of labor, caused by differences of sex and age, a

division  that  is  consequently  based  on  a  purely  physiological

foundation, which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of

the community, by the increase of population, and more especially, by

the conflicts between different tribes, and the subjugation of one tribe

by  another.  On  the  other  hand,  as  I  have  before  remarked,  the

exchange of products springs up at the points where different families,

tribes,  communities,  come  in  contact;  for,  in  the  beginning  of

civilization, it is not private individuals but families, tribes, etc., that

meet on an independent footing. Different communities find different

means  of  production,  and  different  means  of  subsistence  in  their

natural environment. Hence, their modes of production, and of living,

and  their  products  are  different.  It  is  this  spontaneously  developed

difference which, when different communities come in contact, calls

forth the mutual exchange of products, and the consequent gradual

conversion of those products into commodities. Exchange does not

create the differences between the spheres of production, but brings

what are already different into relation, and thus converts them into

more or less inter-dependent branches of the collective production of

an enlarged society [...]

    The foundation of every division of labor that is well developed,

and brought about by the exchange of commodities, is the separationbetween town and country. It may be said, that the whole economic

history of society is summed up in the movement of this antithesis. We

pass it over, however, for the present [...]

    The territorial division of labor, which confines special branches of

production  to  special  districts  of  a  country,  acquires  fresh  stimulus

from  the  manufacturing  system,  which  exploits  every  special

advantage. The colonial system and the opening out of the markets of

the  world,  both  of  which  are  included  in  the  general  conditions  of

existence  of  the  manufacturing  period,  furnish  rich  material  for

developing the division of labor in society. It is not the place, here, to

go  on  to  show  how  division  of  labor  seizes  upon,  not  only  the

economic, but every other sphere of society, and everywhere lays the

foundation of that all engrossing system of specializing and sorting

men, that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense

of all other faculties [...]

    [In] spite of the numerous analogies and links connecting them,

division of labor in the interior of a society, and that in the interior of a

workshop, differ not only in degree, but also in kind [... What] is it that

forms the bond between the independent labors of the cattle-breeder,

the  tanner,  and  the  shoemaker?  It  is  the  fact  that  their  respective

products  are  commodities.  What,  on  the  other  hand,  characterizes

division  of  labor  in  manufactures?  The  fact  that  the  detail  laborer

produces no commodities. It is only the common product of all the

detail laborers that becomes a commodity. Division of labor in society

is brought about by the purchase and sale of the products of different

branches  of  industry,  while  the  connexion  between  the  detail

operations in a workshop, is due to the sale of the labor power of

several workmen to one capitalist, who applies it as combined labor

power. The division of labor in the workshop implies concentration of

the means of production in the hands of one capitalist; the division of

labor  in  society  implies  their  dispersion  among  many  independent

producers  of  commodities  [...]  The a  priori  system  on  which  the

division  of  labor,  within  the  workshop,  is  regularly  carried  out,

becomes in the division of labor within the society, an a posteriori,

nature-imposed  necessity,  controlling  the  lawless  caprice  of  the

producers,  and  perceptible  in  the  barometrical  fluctuations  of  the

market  prices.  Division  of  labor  within  the  workshop  implies  theundisputed authority of the capitalist over men, that are but parts of a

mechanism  that  belongs  to  him.  The  division  of  labor  within  the

society  brings  into  contact  independent  commodity  producers,  who

acknowledge no other authority but that of competition [...]

    The same bourgeois mind which praises division of labor in the

workshop,  life-long  annexation  of  the  laborer  to  a  partial  operation,

and his complete subjection to capital, as being an organization of

labor that increases its productiveness — that same bourgeois mind

denounces with equal vigor every conscious attempt to socially control

and  regulate  the  process  of  production,  as  an  inroad  upon  such

sacred things as the rights of property, freedom and unrestricted play

for the bent of the individual capitalist. It is very characteristic that the

enthusiastic  apologists  of  the  factory  system  have  nothing  more

damning to urge against a general organization of the labor of society,

than that it would turn all society into one immense factory [.]

    The rules of the [Middle Ages] guilds, as I have said before, by

limiting most strictly the number of apprentices and journeymen that a

single master could employ, prevented him from becoming a capitalist.

Moreover,  he  could  not  employ  his  journeymen  in  many  other

handicrafts  than  the  one  in  which  he  was  a  master.  The  guilds

zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants,

the  only  form  of  free  capital  with  which  they  came  in  contact.  A

merchant  could  buy  every  kind  of  commodity,  but  labor  as  a

commodity he could not buy [.] Hence, the guild organization, however

much it may have contributed by separating, isolating, and perfecting

the handicrafts, to create the material conditions for the existence of

manufacture,  excluded  division  of  labor  in  the  workshop.  On  the

whole,  the  laborer  and  his  means  of  production  remained  closely

united, like the snail with its shell, and thus there was wanting the

principal basis of manufacture, the separation of the laborer from his

means of production, and the conversion of these means into capital.

    While division of labor in society at large, whether such division be

brought  about  or  not  by  exchange  of  commodities,  is  common  to

economic formations of society the most diverse, division of labor in

the workshop, as practiced by manufacture, is a special creation of the

capitalist mode of production alone.    Section 5. The Capitalistic Character of Manufacture


    An  increased  number  of  laborers  under  the  control  of  one

capitalist is the natural starting-point, as well of co-operation generally,

as  of  manufacture  in  particular.  But  the  division  of  labor  in

manufacture  makes  this  increase  in  the  number  of  workmen  a

technical necessity. The minimum number that any given capitalist is

bound  to  employ  is  here  prescribed  by  the  previously  established

division of labor. On the other hand, the advantages of further division

are obtainable only by adding to the number of workmen, and this can

be done only by adding multiples of the various detail groups. But an

increase  in  the  variable  component  of  the  capital  employed

necessitates  an  increase  in  its  constant  component,  too,  in  the

workshops, implements, etc., and, in particular, in the raw material,

the call for which grows quicker than the number of workmen. The

quantity of it consumed in a given time, by a given amount of labor,

increases in the same ratio as does the productive power of that labor

in consequence of its division. Hence, it is a law, based on the very

nature of manufacture, that the minimum amount of capital, which is

bound to be in the hands of each capitalist, must keep increasing; in

other words, that the transformation into capital of the social means of

production and subsistence must keep extending [...]

      Manufacture proper not only subjects the previously independent

workman to the discipline and command of capital, but, in addition,

creates  a  hierarchic  gradation  of  the  workmen  themselves.  While

simple co-operation leaves the mode of working by the individual for

the most part unchanged, manufacture thoroughly revolutionizes it [...]

It converts the laborer into a crippled monstrosity [...] Not only is the

detail  work  distributed  to  the  different  individuals,  but  the  individual

himself is made the automatic motor of a fractional operation [...] If, at

first,  the  workman  sells  his  labor  power  to  capital,  because  the

material means of producing a commodity fail him, now his very labor

power  refuses  its  services  unless  it  has  been  sold  to  capital.  Its

functions can be exercised only in an environment that exists in the

workshop of the capitalist after the sale. By nature, unfitted to make

anything  independently,  the  manufacturing  laborer  develops

productive activity as a mere appendage of the capitalist’s workshop[...] This separation begins in simple co-operation, where the capitalist

represents  to  the  single  workman,  the  oneness  and  the  will  of  the

associated labor. It is developed in manufacture which cuts down the

laborer into a detail laborer. It is completed in modern industry, which

makes science a productive force distinct from labor and presses it

into the service of capital [...] In manufacture, in order to make the

collective laborer, and through him capital, rich in social productive

power,  each  laborer  must  be  made  poor  in  individual  productive

powers [.]

    By  decomposition  of  handicrafts,  by  specialization  of  the

instruments  of  labor,  by  the  formation  of  detail  laborers,  and  by

grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism, division of

labor in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation, and a quantitative

proportion in the social process of production; it consequently creates

a definite organization of the labor of society, and thereby develops at

the  same  time  new  productive  forces  in  the  society.  In  its  specific

capitalist form — and under the given conditions, it could take no other

form than a capitalistic one — manufacture is but a particular method

of begetting relative surplus value, or of augmenting at the expense of

the laborer the self-expansion of capital usually called social wealth,

“Wealth of Nations,” etc. It increases the social productive power of

labor, not only for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the

laborer, but it does this by crippling the individual laborers. It creates

new conditions for the lordship of capital over labor. If, therefore, on

the  one  hand,  it  presents  itself  historically  as  a  progress  and  as  a

necessary  phase  in  the  economic  development  of  society,  on  the

other hand, it is a refined and civilized method of exploitation.

    Political Economy, which as an independent science, first sprang

into being during the period of manufacture, views the social division

of labor only from the standpoint of manufacture, and sees in it only

the means of producing more commodities with a given quantity of

labor, and, consequently, of cheapening commodities and hurrying on

the  accumulation  of  capital.  In  most  striking  contrast  with  this

accentuation  of  quantity  and  exchange  value,  is  the  attitude  of  the

writers of classical antiquity, who hold exclusively by quality and use

value [.]    During  the  manufacturing  period  proper,  i.e.,  the  period  during

which  manufacture  is  the  predominant  form  taken  by  capitalist

production, many obstacles are opposed to the full development of the

peculiar tendencies of manufacture. Although manufacture creates, as

we have already seen, a simple separation of the laborers into skilled

and  unskilled,  simultaneously  with  their  hierarchic  arrangement  in

classes,  yet  the  number  of  the  unskilled  laborers,  owing  to  the

preponderating influence of the skilled, remains very limited. Although

it  adapts  the  detail  operations  to  the  various  degrees  of  maturity,

strength,  and  development  of  the  living instruments  of  labor,  thus

conducing to exploitation of women and children, yet this tendency as

a  whole  is  wrecked  on  the  habits  and  the  resistance  of  the  male

laborers.  Although  the  splitting  up  of  handicrafts  lowers  the  cost  of

forming the workman, and thereby lowers his value, yet for the more

difficult detail work, a longer apprenticeship is necessary, and, even

where  it  would  be  superfluous,  is  jealously  insisted  upon  by  the

workmen. In England, for instance, we find the laws of apprenticeship,

with their seven years’ probation, in full force down to the end of the

manufacturing  period;  and  they  are  not  thrown  on  one  side  till  the

advent of modern industry. Since handicraft skill is the foundation of

manufacture, and since the mechanism of manufacture as a whole

possesses no framework, apart from the laborers themselves, capital

is  constantly  compelled  to  wrestle  with  the  insubordination  of  the

workmen [...]

    At the same time manufacture was unable, either to seize upon

the  production  of  society  to  its  full  extent,  or  to  revolutionize  that

production to its very core. It towered up as an economic work of art,

on  the  broad  foundation  of  the  town  handicrafts,  and  of  the  rural

domestic industries. At a given stage in its development, the narrow

technical basis on which manufacture rested, came into conflict with

requirements of production that were created by manufacture itself [.]                  Chapter 15: Machinery and Modern Industry



    Section 1. The Development of Machinery


    John Stuart Mill says in his Principles of Political Economy: “It is

questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened

the day’s toil of any human being”.

    That  is,  however,  by  no  means  the  aim  of  the  capitalistic

application  of  machinery.  Like  every  other  increase  in  the

productiveness  of  labor,  machinery  is  intended  to  cheapen

commodities, and, by shortening that portion of the working day, in

which the laborer works for himself, to lengthen the other portion that

he gives, without an equivalent, to the capitalist. In short, it is a means

for producing surplus value.

    In manufacture, the revolution in the mode of production begins

with the labor power, in modern industry it begins with the instruments

of labor.  Our  first  inquiry  then  is,  how  the instruments of labor are

converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between

a  machine  and  the  implements  of  a  handicraft?  We  are  only

concerned here with striking and general characteristics; for epochs in

the history of society are no more separated from each other by hard

and fast lines of demarcation, than are geological epochs.

      Mathematicians and mechanicians, and in this they are followed

by  a  few  English  economists,  call  a  tool  a  simple  machine,  and  a

machine a complex tool. They see no essential difference between

them, and even give the name of machine to the simple mechanical

powers, the lever, the inclined plane, the screw, the wedge, etc. As a

matter of fact, every machine is a combination of those simple powers,

no matter how they may be disguised. From the economic standpoint

this  explanation  is  worth  nothing,  because  the  historical  element  is

wanting.  Another  explanation  of  the  difference  between  tool  and

machine is that in the case of a tool, man is the motive power, while

the motive power of a machine is something different from man, as,for instance, an animal, water, wind, and so on. According to this, a

plough drawn by oxen, which is a contrivance common to the most

different epochs, would be a machine, while Claussen’s circular loom,

which, worked by a single laborer, weaves 96,000 picks per minute,

would be a mere tool. Nay, this very loom, though a tool when worked

by hand, would, if worked by steam, be a machine. And since the

application  of  animal  power  is  one  of  man’s  earliest  inventions,

production  by  machinery  would  have  preceded  production  by

handicrafts [...]

    All  fully  developed  machinery  consists  of  three  essentially

different  parts,  the  motor  mechanism,  the  transmitting  mechanism,

and finally the tool or working machine. The motor mechanism is that

which  puts  the  whole  in  motion.  It  either  generates  its  own  motive

power, like the steam-engine, the caloric engine, the electromagnetic

machine, etc., or it receives its impulse from some already existing

natural force, like the water-wheel from a head of water, the wind-mill

from wind, etc. The transmitting mechanism, composed of fly-wheels,

shafting,  toothed  wheels,  pulley,  straps,  ropes,  bands,  pinions,  and

gearing of the most varied kinds, regulates the motion, changes its

form  where  necessary,  as  for  instance,  from  linear  to  circular,  and

divides and distributes it among the working machines. These two first

parts of the whole mechanism are there, solely for putting the working

machines in motion, by means of which motion the subject of labor is

seized upon and modified as desired. The tool or working machine is

that part of the machinery with which the industrial revolution of the

18th century started. And to this day it constantly serves as such a

starting-point, whenever a handicraft, or a manufacture, is turned into

an industry carried on by machinery.

    On a closer examination of the working machine proper, we find in

it, as a general rule, though often, no doubt, under very altered forms,

the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or manufacturing

workman;  with  this  difference,  that  instead  of  being  human

implements, they are the implements of a mechanism, or mechanical

implements. Either the entire machine is only a more or less altered

mechanical  edition  of  the  old  handicraft  tool,  as,  for  instance,  the

power-loom, or the working parts fitted in the frame of the machine are

old acquaintances, as spindles are in a mule, needles in a stocking-loom, saws in a sawing-machine, and knives in a chopping machine.

The  distinction  between  these  tools  and  the  body  proper  of  the

machine, exists from their very birth; for they continue for the most

part  to  be  produced  by  handicraft,  or  by  manufacture,  and  are

afterwards fitted into the body of the machine, which is the product of

machinery. The machine proper is therefore a mechanism that, after

being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operations that

were formerly done by the workman with similar tools. Whether the

motive  power  is  derived  from  man,  or  from  some  other  machine,

makes no difference in this respect. From the moment that the tool

proper is taken from man, and fitted into a mechanism, a machine

takes the place of a mere implement. The difference strikes one at

once,  even  in  those  cases  where  man  himself  continues  to  be  the

prime  mover.  The  number  of  implements  that  he  himself  can  use

simultaneously,  is  limited  by  the  number  of  his  own  natural

instruments of production, by the number of his bodily organs [...] The

Jenny,  on  the  other  hand,  even  at  its  very  birth,  spun  with  12-18

spindles, and the stocking-loom knits with many thousand needles at

once.  The  number  of  tools  that  a  machine  can  bring  into  play

simultaneously, is from the very first emancipated from the organic

limits that hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman.

    In many manual implements the distinction between man as mere

motive  power,  and  man  as  the  workman  or  operator  properly  so

called, is brought into striking contrast. For instance, the foot is merely

the prime mover of the spinning-wheel, while the hand, working with

the spindle, and drawing and twisting, performs the real operation of

spinning. It is this last part of the handicraftsman’s implement that is

first seized upon by the industrial revolution, leaving to the workman,

in addition to his new labor of watching the machine with his eyes and

correcting its mistakes with his hands, the merely mechanical part of

being the moving power. On the other hand, implements, in regard to

which  man  has  always  acted  as  a  simple  motive  power,  as,  for

instance, by turning the crank of a mill, by pumping, by moving up and

down  the  arm  of  a  bellows,  by  pounding  with  a  mortar,  etc.,  such

implements soon call for the application of animals, water and wind as

motive powers [...]    The steam-engine itself, such as it was at its invention, during the

manufacturing period at the close of the 17th century, and such as it

continued  to  be  down  to  1780,  did  not  give  rise  to  any  industrial

revolution.  It  was,  on  the  contrary,  the  invention  of  machines  that

made a revolution in the form of steam-engines necessary. As soon

as man, instead of working with an implement on the subject of his

labor, becomes merely the motive power of an implement-machine, it

is a mere accident that motive power takes the disguise of human

muscle; and it may equally well take the form of wind, water or steam

[...]  The  machine,  which  is  the  starting-point  of  the  industrial

revolution, supersedes the workman, who handles a single tool, by a

mechanism operating with a number of similar tools, and set in motion

by a single motive power, whatever the form of that power may be.

Here  we  have  the  machine,  but  only  as  an  elementary  factor  of

production by machinery. Increase in the size of the machine, and in

the number of its working tools, calls for a more massive mechanism

to  drive  it;  and  this  mechanism  requires,  in  order  to  overcome  its

resistance, a mightier moving power than that of man, apart from the

fact  that  man  is  a  very  imperfect  instrument  for  producing  uniform

continued motion [...]

    Wind  was  too  inconstant  and  uncontrollable,  and  besides,  in

England, the birthplace of modern industry, the use of water power

preponderated  even  during  the  manufacturing  period.  In  the  17th

century  attempts  had  already  been  made  to  turn  two  pairs  of

millstones  with  a  single  water-wheel.  But  the  increased  size  of  the

gearing was too much for the water power, which had now become

insufficient, and this was one of the circumstances that led to a more

accurate  investigation  of  the  laws  of  friction.  In  the  same  way  the

irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were put in motion

by pushing and pulling a lever, led to the theory, and the application,

of the fly-wheel, which afterwards plays so important a part in modern

industry. In this way, during the manufacturing period, were developed

the  first  scientific  and  technical  elements  of  modern  mechanical

industry […]

    As  soon  as  tools  had  been  converted  from  being  manual

implements of man into implements of a mechanical apparatus, of a

machine, the motive mechanism also acquired an independent form,entirely  emancipated  from  the  restraints  of  human  strength.

Thereupon  the  individual  machine,  that  we  have  hitherto  been

considering, sinks into a mere factor in production by machinery. One

motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines at once [...]

    We now proceed to distinguish the co-operation of a number of

machines of one kind from a complex system of machinery.

    In the one case, the product is entirely made by a single machine,

which  performs  all  the  various  operations  previously  done  by  one

handicraftsman with his tool; as, for instance, by a weaver with his

loom; or by several handicraftsmen successively, either separately or

as  members  of  a  system  of  manufacture.  For  example,  in  the

manufacture of envelopes, one man folded the paper with the folder,

another laid on the gum, a third turned the flap over, on which the

device is impressed, a fourth embossed the device, and so on; and for

each  of  these  operations  the  envelope  had  to  change  hands.  One

single envelope machine now performs all these operations at once,

and  makes  more  than  3,000  envelopes  in  an  hour.  In  the  London

exhibition of 1862, there was an American machine for making paper

cornets. It cut the paper, pasted, folded, and finished 300 in a minute.

Here, the whole process, which, when carried on as manufacture, was

split up into, and carried out by, a series of operations, is completed

by a single machine, working a combination of various tools. Now,

whether such a machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated

manual  implement,  or  a  combination  of  various  simple  implements

specialized by manufacture, in either case, in the factory, i.e., in the

workshop  in  which  machinery  alone  is  used,  we  meet  again  with

simple co-operation; and, leaving the workman out of consideration for

the  moment,  this  co-operation  presents  itself  to  us,  in  the  first

instance,  as  the  conglomeration  in  one  place  of  similar  and

simultaneously  acting  machines.  Thus,  a  weaving  factory  is

constituted of a number of power-looms, working side by side, and a

sewing  factory  of  a  number  of  sewing-machines  all  in  the  same

building [...]

    A real machinery system, however, does not take the place of

these independent machines, until the subject of labor goes through a

connected series of detail processes, that are carried out by a chain of

machines of various kinds, the one supplementing the other. Here wehave  again  the  co-operation  by  division  of  labor  that  characterizes

manufacture; only now, it is a combination of detail machines. The

special  tools  of  the  various  detail  workmen,  such  as  those  of  the

beaters, cambers, spinners, etc., in the woolen manufacture, are now

transformed  into  the  tools  of  specialized  machines,  each  machine

constituting a special organ, with a special function, in the system. In

those  branches  of  industry  in  which  the  machinery  system  is  first

introduced, manufacture itself furnishes, in a general way, the natural

basis for the division, and consequent organization, of the process of

production.  Nevertheless,  an  essential  difference  at  once  manifests

itself.  In  manufacture  it  is  the  workmen  who,  with  their  manual

implements, must, either singly or in groups, carry on each particular

detail process. If, on the one hand, the workman becomes adapted to

the process, on the other, the process was previously made suitable

to the workman. This subjective principle of the division of labor no

longer  exists  in  production  by  machinery.  Here,  the  process  as  a

whole is examined objectively, in itself, that is to say, without regard to

the question of its execution by human hands, it is analyzed into its

constituent  phases;  and  the  problem,  how  to  execute  each  detail

process,  and  bind  them  all  into  a  whole,  is  solved  by  the  aid  of

machines, chemistry, etc. [...]

    Just  as  in  manufacture,  the  direct  co-operation  of  the  detail

laborers  establishes  a  numerical  proportion  between  the  special

groups,  so  in  an  organized  system  of  machinery,  where  one  detail

machine is constantly kept employed by another, a fixed relation is

established between their numbers, their size, and their speed. The

collective  machine,  now  an  organized  system  of  various  kinds  of

single machines, and of groups of single machines, becomes more

and  more  perfect,  the  more  the  process  as  a  whole  becomes  a

continuous  one,  i.e.,  the  less  the  raw  material  is  interrupted  in  its

passage from its first phase to its last; in other words, the more its

passage from one phase to another is effected, not by the hand of

man, but by the machinery itself [...] A system of machinery, whether it

reposes on the mere co-operation of similar machines, as in weaving,

or on a combination of different machines, as in spinning, constitutes

in itself a huge automaton, whenever it is driven by a self-acting prime

mover [.] As soon as a machine executes, without man’s help, all themovements  requisite  to  elaborate  the  raw  material,  needing  only

attendance from him, we have an automatic system of machinery, and

one that is susceptible of constant improvement in its details [...]

    There  were  mules  and  steam-engines  before  there  were  any

laborers,  whose  exclusive  occupation  it  was  to  make  mules  and

steam-engines;  just  as  men  wore  clothes  before  there  were  such

people as tailors. The inventions of Vaucanson, Arkwright, Watt, and

others,  were,  however,  practicable,  only  because  those  inventors

found, ready to hand, a considerable number of skilled mechanical

workmen, placed at their disposal by the manufacturing period. Some

of these workmen were independent handicraftsman of various trades,

others were grouped together in manufactures, in which, as before-

mentioned,  division  of  labor  was  strictly  carried  out.  As  inventions

increased  in  number,  and  the  demand  for  the  newly  discovered

machines grew larger, the machine-making industry split up, more and

more, into numerous independent branches, and division of labor in

these manufactures was more and more developed.

    Here,  then,  we  see  in  manufacture  the  immediate  technical

foundation of modern industry. Manufacture produced the machinery,

by  means  of  which  modern  industry  abolished  the  handicraft  and

manufacturing  systems  in  those  spheres  of  production  that  it  first

seized upon. The factory system was therefore raised, in the natural

course  of  things,  on  an  inadequate  foundation.  When  the  system

attained  to  a  certain  degree  of  development,  it  had  to  root  up  this

ready-made foundation, which in the meantime had been elaborated

on  the  old  lines,  and  to  build  up  for  itself  a  basis  that  should

correspond  to  its  methods  of  production.  Just  as  the  individual

machine retains a dwarfish character, so long as it is worked by the

power of man alone, and just as no system of machinery could be

properly  developed  before  the  steam-engine  took  the  place  of  the

earlier motive powers, animals, wind, and even water; so, too, modern

industry  was  crippled  in  its  complete  development,  so  long  as  its

characteristic  instrument  of  production,  the  machine,  owed  its

existence to personal strength and personal skill [...]

    [At] a certain stage of its development, modern industry became

technologically  incompatible  with  the  basis  furnished  for  it  by

handicraft and manufacture. The increasing size of the prime movers,of  the  transmitting  mechanism,  and  of  the  machines  proper,  the

greater complication, multiformity and regularity of the details of these

machines, as they more and more departed from the model of those

originally made by manual labor, and acquired a form, untrammeled

except by the conditions under which they worked, the perfecting of

the automatic system, and the use, every day more unavoidable, of a

more refractory material, such as iron instead of wood the solution of

all these problems, which sprang up by the force of circumstances,

everywhere  met  with  a  stumbling-block  in  the  personal  restrictions,

which  even  the  collective  laborer  of  manufacture  could  not  break

through, except to a limited extent.

    Such  machines  as  the  modern  hydraulic  press,  the  modern

power-loom, and the modern carding engine, could never have been

furnished by manufacture [...] at a certain stage of its development,

modern industry became technologically incompatible with the basis

furnished for it by handicraft and manufacture. The increasing size of

the prime movers, of the transmitting mechanism, and of the machines

proper,  the  greater  complication,  multiformity  and  regularity  of  the

details of these machines, as they more and more departed from the

model of those originally made by manual labor, and acquired a form,

untrammeled except by the conditions under which they worked, the

perfecting  of  the  automatic  system,  and  the  use,  every  day  more

unavoidable,  of  a  more  refractory  material,  such  as  iron  instead  of

wood — the solution of all these problems, which sprang up by the

force of circumstances, everywhere met with a stumbling-block in the

personal restrictions, which even the collective laborer of manufacture

could not break through, except to a limited extent. Such machines as

the modern hydraulic press, the modern power-loom, and the modern

carding engine, could never have been furnished by manufacture [...]

    Modern industry had therefore itself to take in hand the machine,

its characteristic instrument of production, and to construct machines

by machines. It was not till it did this, that it built up for itself a fitting

technical  foundation,  and  stood  on  its  own  feet.  Machinery,

simultaneously with the increasing use of it, in the first decades of this

century, appropriated, by degrees, the fabrication of machines proper.

But  it  was  only  during  the  decade  preceding  1866,  that  the

construction of railways and ocean steamers on a stupendous scalecalled into existence the cyclopean machines now employed in the

construction of prime movers.

    The  most  essential  condition  to  the  production  of  machines  by

machines was a prime mover capable of exerting any amount of force,

and yet under perfect control. Such a condition was already supplied

by  the  steam-engine.  But  at  the  same  time  it  was  necessary  to

produce  the  geometrically  accurate  straight  lines,  planes,  circles,

cylinders,  cones,  and  spheres,  required  in  the  detail  parts  of  the

machines. This problem Henry Maudsley solved in the first decade of

this century by the invention of the slide rest, a tool that was soon

made  automatic,  and  in  a  modified  form  was  applied  to  other

constructive  machines  besides  the  lathe,  for  which  it  was  originally

intended.  This  mechanical  appliance  replaces,  not  some  particular

tool, but the hand itself, which produces a given form by holding and

guiding the cutting tool along the iron or other material operated upon.

Thus it became possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of

machinery [...]

    If  we  now  fix  our  attention  on  that  portion  of  the  machinery

employed  in  the  construction  of  machines,  which  constitutes  the

operating tool, we find the manual implements re-appearing, but on a

cyclopean  scale.  The  operating  part  of  the  boring  machine  is  an

immense drill driven by a steam-engine; without this machine, on the

other  hand,  the  cylinders  of  large  steam-engines  and  of  hydraulic

presses could not be made. The mechanical lathe is only a cyclopean

reproduction of the ordinary foot-lathe [...]

    The implements of labor, in the form of machinery, necessitate the

substitution  of  natural  forces  for  human  force,  and  the  conscious

application of science, instead of rule of thumb. In manufacture, the

organization  of  the  social  labor  process  is  purely  subjective;  it  is  a

combination  of  detail  laborers;  in  its  machinery  system,  modern

industry has a productive organism that is purely objective, in which

the  laborer  becomes  a  mere  appendage  to  an  already  existing

material condition of production. In simple co-operation, and even in

that founded on division of labor, the suppression of the isolated, by

the collective, workman still appears to be more or less accidental.

Machinery, with a few exceptions to be mentioned later, operates only

by  means  of  associated  labor,  or  labor  in  common.  Hence  the  co-operative  character  of  the  labor  process  is,  in  the  latter  case,  a

technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labor itself.



    Section 2. The Value Transferred by Machinery to the Product


    Although,  therefore,  it  is  clear  at  the  first  glance  that,  by

incorporating  both  stupendous  physical  forces,  and  the  natural

sciences, with the process of production, modern industry raises the

productiveness of labor to an extraordinary degree, it is by no means

equally clear, that this increased productive force is not, on the other

hand, purchased by an increased expenditure of labor. Machinery, like

every other component of constant capital, creates no new value, but

yields up its own value to the product that it serves to beget. In so far

as the machine has value, and, in consequence, parts with value to

the product, it forms an element in the value of that product. Instead of

being  cheapened,  the  product  is  made  dearer  in  proportion  to  the

value of the machine [...] In the first place, it must be observed that the

machinery, while always entering as a whole into the labor process,

enters  into  the  value-begetting  process  only  by  bits.  It  never  adds

more value than it loses, on an average, by wear and tear. Hence

there is a great difference between the value of a machine, and the

value transferred in a given time by that machine to the product.

    The longer the life of the machine in the labor process, the greater

is that difference. It is true, no doubt, as we have already seen, that

every instrument of labor enters as a whole into the labor process, and

only piece-meal, proportionally to its average daily loss by wear and

tear, into the value-begetting process. But this difference between the

instrument as a whole and its daily wear and tear, is much greater in a

machine than in a tool, because the machine, being made from more

durable material, has a longer life [...] Given the difference between

the value of the machinery, and the value transferred by it in a day to

the product, the extent to which this latter value makes the product

dearer,  depends  in  the  first  instance,  upon  the  [dimensions]  of  the

product [...] Given a machine’s capacity for work, that is, the number

of its operating tools, or, where it is a question of force, their mass, the

amount of its product will depend on the velocity of its working parts,on the speed, for instance, of the spindles, or on the number of blows

given  by  the  hammer  in  a  minute  [...]  Given  the  rate  at  which

machinery transfers its value to the product, the amount of value so

transferred  depends  on  the  total  value  of  the  machinery.  The  less

labor  it  contains,  the  less  value  it  imparts  to  the  product.  The  less

value it gives up, so much the more productive it is, and so much the

more  its  services  approximate  to  those  of  natural  forces.  But  the

production of machinery by machinery lessens its value relatively to its

extension and efficacy [.]

    It is evident that whenever it costs as much labor to produce a

machine  as  is  saved  by  the  employment  of  that  machine,  there  is

nothing  but  a  transposition  of  labor;  consequently,  the  total  labor

required  to  produce  a  commodity  is  not  lessened  or  the

productiveness of labor is not increased. It is clear, however, that the

difference between the labor a machine costs, and the labor it saves,

in other words, that the degree of its productiveness does not depend

on  the  difference  between  its  own  value  and  the  value  of  the

implement it replaces. As long as the labor spent on a machine, and

consequently the portion of its value added to the product, remains

smaller than the value added by the workman to the product with his

tool,  there  is  always  a  difference  of  labor  saved  in  favor  of  the

machine. The productiveness of a machine is therefore measured by

the human labor power it replaces [...] Where block printing, the old

method of printing calico by hand, has been superseded by machine

printing, a single machine prints, with the aid of one man or boy, as

much calico of four colors in one hour, as it formerly took 200 men to

do [.]

    As  already  stated,  a  steam-plough  does  as  much  work  in  one

hour at a cost of three-pence, as 66 men at a cost of 15 shillings. I

return to this example in order to clear up an erroneous notion. The 15

shillings are by no means the expression in money of all the labor

expended in one hour by the 66 men. If the ratio of surplus labor to

necessary labor were 100%, these 66 men would produce in one hour

a value of 30 shillings, although their wages, 15 shillings, represent

only their labor for half an hour. Suppose, then, a machine cost as

much as the wages for a year of the 150 men it displaces, say £3,000;

this  £3,000  is  by  no  means  the  expression  in  money  of  the  laboradded  to  the  object  produced  by  these  150  men  before  the

introduction  of  the  machine,  but  only  of  that  portion  of  their  year’s

labor which was expended for themselves and represented by their

wages.  On  the  other  hand,  the  £3,000,  the  money  value  of  the

machine,  expresses  all  the  labor  expended  on  its  production,  no

matter  in  what  proportion  this  labor  constitutes  wages  for  the

workman,  and  surplus  value  for  the  capitalist.  Therefore,  though  a

machine cost as much as the labor power displaced by it costs, yet

the labor materialized in it is even then much less than the living labor

it replaces.

    The use of machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the

product, is limited in this way, that less labor must be expended in

producing the machinery than is displaced by the employment of that

machinery, For the capitalist, however, this use is still more limited.

Instead of paying for the labor, he only pays the value of the labor

power employed; therefore, the limit to his using a machine is fixed by

the difference between the value of the machine and the value of the

labor power replaced by it. Since the division of the day’s work into

necessary and surplus labor differs in different countries, and even in

the  same  country  at  different  periods,  or  in  different  branches  of

industry; and further, since the actual wage of the laborer at one time

sinks below the value of his labor power, at another rises above it, it is

possible for the difference between the price of the machinery and the

price of the labor power replaced by that machinery to vary very much,

although  the  difference  between  the  quantity  of  labor  requisite  to

produce  the  machine  and  the  total  quantity  replaced  by  it,  remain

constant [.]



    Section  3.  The  Proximate  Effects  of  Machinery  on  the

Workman


    [...]

    a. Appropriation of Supplementary Labor Power by Capital.

The Employment of Women and Children

    In  so  far  as  machinery  dispenses  with  muscular  power,  it

becomes a means of employing laborers of slight muscular strength,and those whose bodily development is incomplete, but whose limbs

are all the suppler. The labor of women and children was, therefore,

the  first  thing  sought  for  by  capitalists  who  used  machinery.  That

mighty substitute for labor and laborers was forthwith changed into a

means for increasing the number of wage laborers by enrolling, under

the  direct  sway  of  capital,  every  member  of  the  workman’s  family,

without distinction of age or sex. Compulsory work for the capitalist

usurped the place, not only of the children’s play, but also of free labor

at home within moderate limits for the support of the family.

    The value of labor power was determined, not only by the labor

time necessary to maintain the individual adult laborer, but also by that

necessary  to  maintain  his  family.  Machinery,  by  throwing  every

member of that family on to the labor market, spreads the value of the

man’s labor power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labor

power. To purchase the labor power of a family of four workers may,

perhaps, cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labor power of

the head of the family, but, in return, four days’ labor takes the place

of one, and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus

labor of four over the surplus labor of one. In order that the family may

live, four people must now, not only labor, but expend surplus labor for

the  capitalist.  Thus  we  see,  that  machinery,  while  augmenting  the

human material that forms the principal object of capital’s exploiting

power, at the same time raises the degree of exploitation [...]

    b. Prolongation of the Working Day

    If  machinery  be  the  most  powerful  means  for  increasing  the

productiveness  of  labor  —  i.e.,  for  shortening  the  working  time

required in the production of a commodity, it becomes in the hands of

capital the most powerful means, in those industries first invaded by it,

for  lengthening  the  working  day  beyond  all  bounds  set  by  human

nature. It creates, on the one hand, new conditions by which capital is

enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency, and on the

other hand, new motives with which to whet capital’s appetite for the

labor of others.

    In the first place, in the form of machinery, the implements of labor

become  automatic,  things  moving  and  working  independent  of  the

workman. They are thenceforth an industrial perpetuum mobile, that

would  go  on  producing  forever,  did  it  not  meet  with  certain  naturalobstructions  in  the  weak  bodies  and  the  strong  wills  of  its  human

attendants. The automaton, as capital, and because it is capital, is

endowed, in the person of the capitalist, with intelligence and will; it is

therefore  animated  by  the  longing  to  reduce  to  a  minimum  the

resistance offered by that repellent yet elastic natural barrier, man [...]

    The  productiveness  of  machinery  is,  as  we  saw,  inversely

proportional to the value transferred by it to the product. The longer

the life of the machine, the greater is the mass of the products over

which the value transmitted by the machine is spread, and the less is

the portion of that value added to each single commodity. The active

lifetime of a machine is, however, clearly dependent on the length of

the  working  day,  or  on  the  duration  of  the  daily  labor  process

multiplied by the number of days for which the process is carried on.

    The wear and tear of a machine is not exactly proportional to its

working time. And even if it were so, a machine working 16 hours daily

for 1XA years, covers as long a working period as, and transmits to

the total product no more value than, the same machine would if it

worked only 8 hours daily for 15 years. But in the first case the value

of the machine would be reproduced twice as quickly as in the latter,

and the capitalist would, by this use of the machine, absorb in 7 
                                                                                        1/2

years as much surplus value as in the second case he would in 15 [.]

    [In]  addition  to  the  material  wear  and  tear,  a  machine  also

undergoes, what we may call a moral depreciation. It loses exchange

value, either by machines of the same sort being produced cheaper

than it, or by better machines entering into competition with it. In both

cases, be the machine ever so young and full of life, its value is no

longer determined by the labor actually materialized in it, but by the

labor time requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine. It has,

therefore,  lost  value  more  or  less.  The  shorter  the  period  taken  to

reproduce its total value, the less is the danger of moral depreciation;

and the longer the working day, the shorter is that period [.]

    Given  the  length  of  the  working  day,  all  other  circumstances

remaining  the  same,  the  exploitation  of  double  the  number  of

workmen demands, not only a doubling of that part of constant capital

which  is  invested  in  machinery  and  buildings,  but  also  of  that  part

which  is  laid  out  in  raw  material  and  auxiliary  substances.  The

lengthening  of  the  working  day,  on  the  other  hand,  allows  ofproduction on an extended scale without any alteration in the amount

of  capital  laid  out  on  machinery  and  buildings.  Not  only  is  there,

therefore, an increase of surplus value, but the outlay necessary to

obtain it diminishes. It is true that this takes place, more or less, with

every  lengthening  of  the  working  day;  but  in  the  case  under

consideration,  the  change  is  more  marked,  because  the  capital

converted  into  the instruments  of  labor  preponderates  to  a  greater

degree [...]

    Machinery  produces  relative  surplus  value;  not  only  by  directly

depreciating the value of labor power, and by indirectly cheapening

the  same  through  cheapening  the  commodities  that  enter  into  its

reproduction, but also, when it is first introduced sporadically into an

industry,  by  converting  the  labor  employed  by  the  owner  of  that

machinery,  into  labor  of  a  higher  degree  and  greater  efficacy,  by

raising  the  social  value  of  the  article  produced  above  its  individual

value, and thus enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a day’s

labor  power  by  a  smaller  portion  of  the  value  of  a  day’s  product.

During this transition period, when the use of machinery is a sort of

monopoly,  the  profits  are  therefore  exceptional,  and  the  capitalist

endeavors to exploit thoroughly “the sunny time of this his first love”,

by prolonging the working day as much as possible. The magnitude of

the profit whets his appetite for more profit.

    As the use of machinery becomes more general in a particular

industry, the social value of the product sinks down to its individual

value, and the law that surplus value does not arise from the labor

power that has been replaced by the machinery, but from the labor

power actually employed in working with the machinery, asserts itself.

Surplus value arises from variable capital alone, and we saw that the

amount  of  surplus  value  depends  on  two  factors,  viz.,  the  rate  of

surplus  value  and  the  number  of  the  workmen  simultaneously

employed. Given the length of the working day, the rate of surplus

value is determined by the relative duration of the necessary labor and

of  the  surplus  labor  in  a  day.  The  number  of  the  laborers

simultaneously  employed  depends,  on  its  side,  on  the  ratio  of  the

variable  to  the  constant  capital.  Now,  however  much  the  use  of

machinery  may  increase  the  surplus  labor  at  the  expense  of  the

necessary labor by heightening the productiveness of labor, it is clearthat it attains this result, only by diminishing the number of workmen

employed by a given amount of capital. It converts what was formerly

variable capital, invested in labor power, into machinery which, being

constant capital, does not produce surplus value. It is impossible, for

instance,  to  squeeze  as  much  surplus  value  out  of  2  as  out  of  24

laborers. If each of these 24 men gives only one hour of surplus labor

in 12, the 24 men give together 24 hours of surplus labor, while 24

hours is the total labor of the two men.

    Hence, the application of machinery to the production of surplus

value implies a contradiction which is immanent in it, since of the two

factors of the surplus value created by a given amount of capital, one,

the rate of surplus value, cannot be increased, except by diminishing

the other, the number of workmen. This contradiction comes to light,

as  soon  as  by  the  general  employment  of  machinery  in  a  given

industry, the value of the machine-produced commodity regulates the

value of all commodities of the same sort; and it is this contradiction,

that in its turn, drives the capitalist, without his being conscious of the

fact, to excessive lengthening of the working day, in order that he may

compensate the decrease in the relative number of laborers exploited,

by an increase not only of the relative, but of the absolute surplus

labor [...] Hence, too, the economic paradox, that the most powerful

instrument  for  shortening  labor  time,  becomes  the  most  unfailing

means for placing every moment of the laborer’s time and that of his

family, at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding

the value of his capital [.]

    c. Intensification of Labor

    The  immoderate  lengthening  of  the  working  day,  produced  by

machinery in the hands of capital, leads to a reaction on the part of

society, the very sources of whose life are menaced; and, thence, to a

normal  working  day  whose  length  is  fixed  by  law.  Thenceforth  a

phenomenon  that  we  have  already  met  with,  namely,  the

intensification of labor, develops into great importance. Our analysis of

absolute  surplus  value  had  reference  primarily  to  the  extension  or

duration of the labor; its intensity being assumed as given. We now

proceed  to  consider  the  substitution  of  a  more  intensified  labor  for

labor of more extensive duration, and the degree of the former.    It  is  self-evident,  that  in  proportion  as  the  use  of  machinery

spreads, and the experience of a special class of workmen habituated

to machinery accumulates, the rapidity and intensity of labor increase

as  a  natural  consequence.  Thus  in  England,  during  half  a  century,

lengthening  of  the  working  day  went  hand  in  hand  with  increasing

intensity of factory labor. Nevertheless, the reader will clearly see, that

where we have labor, not carried on by fits and starts, but repeated

day  after  day  with  unvarying  uniformity,  a  point  must  inevitably  be

reached, where extension of the working day and intensity of the labor

mutually exclude one another, in such a way that lengthening of the

working day becomes compatible only with a lower degree of intensity,

and a higher degree of intensity, only with a shortening of the working

day.  So  soon  as  the  gradually  surging  revolt  of  the  working  class

compelled Parliament to shorten compulsorily the hours of labor, and

to begin by imposing a normal working day on factories proper, so

soon consequently as an increased production of surplus value by the

prolongation of the working day was once for all put a stop to, from

that moment capital threw itself with all its might into the production of

relative  surplus  value,  by  hastening  on  the  further  improvement  of

machinery.

    At the same time a change took place in the nature of relative

surplus  value.  Generally  speaking,  the  mode  of  producing  relative

surplus value consists in raising the productive power of the workman,

so as to enable him to produce more in a given time with the same

expenditure of labor. Labor time continues to transmit as before the

same  value  to  the  total  product,  but  this  unchanged  amount  of

exchange value is spread over more use value; hence the value of

each  single  commodity  sinks.  Otherwise,  however,  so  soon  as  the

compulsory shortening of the hours of labor takes place. The immense

impetus  it  gives  the  development  of  productive  power,  and  to

economy  in  the  means  of  production,  imposes  on  the  workman

increased expenditure of labor in a given time, heightened tension of

labor power, and closer filling up of the pores of the working day, or

condensation of labor to a degree that is attainable only within the

limits of the shortened working day. This condensation of a greater

mass  of  labor  into  a  given  period  thenceforward  counts  for  what  it

really is, a greater quantity of labor. In addition to a measure of itsextension, i.e., duration, labor now acquires a measure of its intensity

or of the degree of its condensation or density. The denser hour of the

ten  hours’  working  day  contains  more  labor,  i.e.,  expended  labor

power than the more porous hour of the twelve hours’ working day.

The product therefore of one of the former hours has as much or more

value than has the product of 1 1/5 of the latter hours. Apart from the

increased  yield  of  relative  surplus  value  through  the  heightened

productiveness of labor, the same mass of value is now produced for

the capitalist say by 3 1/3 hours of surplus labor, and 6 2/3 hours of

necessary labor, as was previously produced by four hours of surplus

labor  and  eight  hours  of  necessary  labor  [...].  So  soon  as  that

shortening  [of  the  working  day]  becomes  compulsory,  machinery

becomes in the hands of capital the objective means, systematically

employed  for  squeezing  out  more  labor  in  a  given  time.  This  is

effected in two ways: by increasing the speed of the machinery, and

by giving the workman more machinery to tent [.]



    Section 4. -The Factory


    At the commencement of this Chapter we considered that which

we may call the body of the factory, i.e., machinery organized into a

system.  We  there  saw  how  machinery,  by  annexing  the  labor  of

women  and  children,  augments  the  number  of  human  beings  who

form  the  material  for  capitalistic  exploitation,  how  it  confiscates  the

whole of the workman’s disposable time, by immoderate extension of

the  hours  of  labor,  and  how  finally  its  progress,  which  allows  of

enormous  increase  of  production  in  shorter  and  shorter  periods,

serves  as  a  means  of  systematically  getting  more  work  done  in  a

shorter time, or of exploiting labor power more intensely. We now turn

to the factory as a whole, and that in its most perfect form.

    Dr. Ure, the Pindar of the automatic factory, describes it, on the

one hand, as “Combined co-operation of many orders of workpeople,

adult  and  young,  in  tending  with  assiduous  skill,  a  system  of

productive machines, continuously impelled by a central power” (the

prime mover); on the other hand, as “a vast automaton, composed of

various  mechanical  and  intellectual  organs,  acting  in  uninterruptedconcert  for  the  production  of  a  common  object,  all  of  them  being

subordinate to a self-regulated moving force”.

    These two descriptions are far from being identical. In one, the

collective laborer, or social body of labor, appears as the dominant

subject, and the mechanical automaton as the object; in the other, the

automaton itself is the subject, and the workmen are merely conscious

organs,  co-ordinate  with  the  unconscious  organs  of  the  automaton,

and  together  with  them,  subordinated  to  the  central  moving-power.

The  first  description  is  applicable  to  every  possible  employment  of

machinery on a large scale, the second is characteristic of its use by

capital, and therefore of the modern factory system [...]

    Along with the tool, the skill of the workman in handling it passes

over to the machine. The capabilities of the tool are emancipated from

the restraints that are inseparable from human labor power. Thereby

the  technical  foundation  on  which  is  based  the  division  of  labor  in

manufacture, is swept away. Hence, in the place of the hierarchy of

specialized workmen that characterizes manufacture, there steps, in

the automatic factory, a tendency to equalize and reduce to one and

the same level every kind of work that has to be done by the minders

of the machines; in the place of the artificially produced differentiations

of the detail workmen, step the natural differences of age and sex.

    So far as division of labor re-appears in the factory, it is primarily a

distribution of the workmen among the specialized machines; and of

masses of workmen, not however organized into groups, among the

various departments of the factory, in each of which they work at a

number  of  similar  machines  placed  together;  their  co-operation,

therefore,  is  only  simple.  The  organized  group,  peculiar  to

manufacture,  is  replaced  by  the  connexion  between  the  head

workman  and  his  few  assistants.  The  essential  division  is,  into

workmen who are actually employed on the machines (among whom

are  included  a  few  who  look  after  the  engine),  and  into  mere

attendants (almost exclusively children) of these workmen. Among the

attendants are reckoned more or less all “Feeders” who supply the

machines  with  the  material  to  be  worked.  In  addition  to  these  two

principal classes, there is a numerically unimportant class of persons,

whose occupation it is to look after the whole of the machinery and

repair it from time to time; such as engineers, mechanics, joiners, etc.This  is  a  superior  class  of  workmen,  some  of  them  scientifically

educated, others brought up to a trade; it is distinct from the factory

operative class, and merely aggregated to it. This division of labor is

purely technical.

    To  work  at  a  machine,  the  workman  should  be  taught  from

childhood, in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to

the  uniform  and  unceasing  motion  of  an  automaton.  When  the

machinery, as a whole, forms a system of manifold machines, working

simultaneously  and  in  concert,  the  co-operation  based  upon  it,

requires  the  distribution  of  various  groups  of  workmen  among  the

different kinds of machines. But the employment of machinery does

away  with  the  necessity  of  crystallizing  this  distribution  after  the

manner  of  manufacture,  by  the  constant  annexation  of  a  particular

man to a particular function. Since the motion of the whole system

does  not  proceed  from  the  workman,  but  from  the  machinery,  a

change of persons can take place at any time without an interruption

of the work. The most striking proof of this is afforded by the relays

system,  put  into  operation  by  the  manufacturers  during  their  revolt

from  1848-1850.  Lastly,  the  quickness  with  which  machine  work  is

learnt by young people, does away with the necessity of bringing up

for exclusive employment by machinery, a special class of operatives

[...]

    Although then, technically speaking, the old system of division of

labor is thrown overboard by machinery, it hangs on in the factory, as

a traditional habit handed down from manufacture, and is afterwards

systematically re-molded and established in a more hideous form by

capital, as a means of exploiting labor power. The life-long specialty of

handling one and the same tool, now becomes the life-long specialty

of serving one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong

use,  with  the  object  of  transforming  the  workman,  from  his  very

childhood, into a part of a detail-machine. In this way, not only are the

expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened, but at the same

time  his  helpless  dependence  upon  the  factory  as  a  whole,  and

therefore upon the capitalist, is rendered complete [...] In handicrafts

and manufacture, the workman makes use of a tool, in the factory, the

machine makes use of him. There the movements of the instrument of

labor proceed from him, here it is the movements of the machine thathe  must  follow.  In  manufacture  the  workmen  are  parts  of  a  living

mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent

of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage [.]

    At the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system

to  the  uttermost,  it  does  away  with  the  many-sided  play  of  the

muscles, and confiscates every atom of freedom, both in bodily and

intellectual activity [...] Every kind of capitalist production, in so far as it

is  not  only  a  labor  process,  but  also  a  process  of  creating  surplus

value, has this in common, that it is not the workman that employs the

instruments  of  labor,  but  the instruments  of  labor  that  employ  the

workman. But it is only in the factory system that this inversion for the

first  time  acquires  technical  and  palpable  reality.  By  means  of  its

conversion into an automaton, the instrument of labor confronts the

laborer,  during  the  labor  process,  in  the  shape  of  capital,  of  dead

labor,  that  dominates,  and  pumps  dry,  living  labor  power  [...]  The

special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative vanishes

as an infinitesimal quantity before the science, the gigantic physical

forces,  and  the  mass  of  labor  that  are  embodied  in  the  factory

mechanism and, together with that mechanism, constitute the power

of the “master” [.] The technical subordination of the workman to the

uniform  motion  of  the instruments  of  labor,  and  the  peculiar

composition  of  the  body  of  workpeople,  consisting  as  it  does  of

individuals  of  both  sexes  and  of  all  ages,  give  rise  to  a  barrack

discipline, which is elaborated into a complete system in the factory,

and which fully develops the before mentioned labor of overlooking,

thereby dividing the workpeople into operatives and over lookers, into

private  soldiers  and  sergeants  of  an  industrial  army  [.  The]  main

difficulty  [in  the  automatic  factory  lay]  above  all  in  training  human

beings  to  renounce  their  desultory  habits  of  work,  and  to  identify

themselves  with  the  unvarying  regularity  of  the  complex  automaton

[...] The place of the slave-driver’s lash is taken by the over looker’s

book of penalties. All punishments naturally resolve themselves into

fines and deductions from wages [...]



    Section 5. The Strife Between Workman and Machine    The contest between the capitalist and the wage laborer dates

back to the very origin of capital. It raged on throughout the whole

manufacturing period. But only since the introduction of machinery has

the workman fought against the instrument of labor itself, the material

embodiment of capital. He revolts against this particular form of the

means  of  production,  as  being  the  material  basis  of  the  capitalist

mode of production [.]

    The  contests  about  wages  in  manufacture,  pre-suppose

manufacture, and are in no sense directed against its existence. The

opposition against the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds

from the guilds and privileged towns, not from the workpeople. Hence

the  writers  of  the  manufacturing  period  treat  the  division  of  labor

chiefly as a means of virtually supplying a deficiency of laborers, and

not as a means of actually displacing those in work [...]

    The  instrument  of  labor,  when  it  takes  the  form  of  a  machine,

immediately becomes a competitor of the workman himself. The self-

expansion of capital by means of machinery is thenceforward directly

proportional  to  the  number  of  the  workpeople,  whose  means  of

livelihood have been destroyed by that machinery. The whole system

of capitalist production is based on the fact that the workman sells his

labor power as a commodity. Division of labor specializes this labor

power, by reducing it to skill in handling a particular tool. So soon as

the handling of this tool becomes the work of a machine, then, with the

use  value,  the  exchange  value  too,  of  the  workman’s  labor  power

vanishes; the workman becomes unsaleable, like paper money thrown

out of currency by legal enactment. That portion of the working class,

thus by machinery rendered superfluous, i.e., no longer immediately

necessary for the self-expansion of capital, either goes to the wall in

the  unequal  contest  of  the  old  handicrafts  and  manufactures  with

machinery, or else floods all the more easily accessible branches of

industry, swamps the labor market, and sinks the price of labor power

below its value [...]

    But machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better of

the  workman,  and  is  constantly  on  the  point  of  making  him

superfluous. It is also a power inimical to him, and as such capital

proclaims it from the roof tops and as such makes use of it. It is themost powerful weapon for repressing strikes, those periodical revolts

of the working class against the autocracy of capital [...]      PART 5: THE PRODUCTION OF ABSOLUTE AND OF

                      RELATIVE SURPLUS VALUE              Chapter 16: Absolute and Relative Surplus Value



    Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities;

it is essentially the production of surplus value. The laborer produces,

not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices, therefore, that he

should simply produce. He must produce surplus value. That laborer

alone is productive, who produces surplus value for the capitalist, and

thus  works  for  the  self-expansion  of  capital.  If  we  may  take  an

example from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a

schoolmaster is a productive laborer when, in addition to belaboring

the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school

proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory,

instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. Hence the

notion of a productive laborer implies not merely a relation between

work and useful effect, between laborer and product of labor, but also

a specific, social relation of production, a relation that has sprung up

historically  and  stamps  the  laborer  as  the  direct  means  of  creating

surplus value. To be a productive laborer is, therefore, not a piece of

luck, but a misfortune [.]

    The prolongation of the working day beyond the point at which the

laborer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his

labor power, and the appropriation of that surplus labor by capital, this

is  production  of  absolute  surplus  value.  It  forms  the  general

groundwork  of  the  capitalist  system,  and  the  starting-point  for  the

production of relative surplus value. The latter pre-supposes that the

working day is already divided into two parts, necessary labor, and

surplus  labor.  In  order  to  prolong  the  surplus  labor,  the  necessary

labor is shortened by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages

is  produced  in  less  time.  The  production  of  absolute  surplus  value

turns exclusively upon the length of the working day; the production of

relative  surplus  value,  revolutionizes  out  and  out  the  technical

processes of labor, and the composition of society. It therefore pre-

supposes a specific mode, the capitalist mode of production, a mode

which,  along  with  its  methods,  means,  and  conditions,  arises  and

develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formalsubjection of labor to capital. In the course of this development, the

formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labor to capital

[...]        Chapter 17: Changes of Magnitude in The Price Of Labor

                          Power And In Surplus Value



    The  value  of  labor  power  is  determined  by  the  value  of  the

necessaries  of  life  habitually  required  by  the  average  laborer.  The

quantity of these necessaries is known at any given epoch of a given

society, and can therefore be treated as a constant magnitude. What

changes, is the value of this quantity. There are, besides, two other

factors that enter into the determination of the value of labor power.

One, the expenses of developing that power, which expenses vary

with  the  mode  of  production;  the  other,  its  natural  diversity,  the

difference between the labor power of men and women, of children

and adults. The employment of these different sorts of labor power, an

employment  which  is,  in  its  turn,  made  necessary  by  the  mode  of

production, makes a great difference in the cost of maintaining the

family of the laborer, and in the value of the labor power of the adult

male.  Both  these  factors,  however,  are  excluded  in  the  following

investigation.

    I assume (1) that commodities are sold at their value; (2) that the

price of labor power rises occasionally above its value, but never sinks

below it.

    On this assumption we have seen that the relative magnitudes of

surplus  value  and  of  price  of  labor  power  are  determined  by  three

circumstances;  (1)  the  length  of  the  working  day,  or  the  extensive

magnitude  of  labor;  (2)  the  normal  intensity  of  labor,  its  intensive

magnitude, whereby a given quantity of labor is expended in a given

time; (3) the productiveness of labor, whereby the same quantum of

labor yields, in a given time, a greater or less quantum of product,

dependent  on  the  degree  of  development  in  the  conditions  of

production. Very different combinations are clearly possible, according

as  one  of  the  three  factors  is  constant  and  two  variables,  or  two

constant and one variable, or lastly, all three simultaneously variable.

And the number of these combinations is augmented by the fact that,when these factors simultaneously vary, the amount and direction of

their  respective  variations  may  differ.  In  what  follows  the  chief

combinations alone are considered.



    Section 1. Length of The Working D Ay and Intensity of Labor

Constant. Productiveness of Labor Variable


    On  these  assumptions  the  value  of  labor  power,  and  the

magnitude of surplus value, are determined by three laws.

    (1.)  A  working  day  of  given  length  always  creates  the  same

amount of value, no matter how the productiveness of labor, and, with

it, the mass of the product, and the price of each single commodity

produced, may vary.

    If the value created by a working day of 12 hours be, say, six

shillings, then, although the mass of the articles produced varies with

the  productiveness  of  labor,  the  only  result  is  that  the  value

represented by six shillings is spread over a greater or less number of

articles.

    (2.) Surplus value and the value of labor power vary in opposite

directions. A variation in the productiveness of labor, its increase or

diminution, causes a variation in the opposite direction in the value of

labor power, and in the same direction in surplus value.

    The value created by a working day of 12 hours is a constant

quantity, say, six shillings. This constant quantity is the sum of the

surplus value plus the value of the labor power, which latter value the

laborer replaces by an equivalent. It is self-evident, that if a constant

quantity consists of two parts, neither of them can increase without the

other diminishing. Let the two parts at starting be equal; 3 shillings’

value of labor power, 3 shillings’ surplus value. Then the value of the

labor power cannot rise from three shillings to four, without the surplus

value falling from three shillings to two; and the surplus value cannot

rise from three shillings to four, without the value of labor power falling

from three shillings to two. Under these circumstances, therefore, no

change can take place in the absolute magnitude, either of the surplus

value, or of the value of labor power, without a simultaneous changein  their  relative  magnitudes,  i.e.,  relatively  to  each  other.  It  is

impossible for them to rise or fall simultaneously.

    Further, the value of labor power cannot fall, and consequently

surplus value cannot rise, without a rise in the productiveness of labor.

For instance, in the above case, the value of the labor power cannot

sink  from  three  shillings  to  two,  unless  an  increase  in  the

productiveness of labor makes it possible to produce in 4 hours the

same  quantity  of  necessaries  as  previously  required  6  hours  to

produce. On the other hand, the value of the labor power cannot rise

from three shillings to four, without a decrease in the productiveness

of labor, whereby eight hours become requisite to produce the same

quantity  of  necessaries,  for  the  production  of  which  six  hours

previously  sufficed.  It  follows  from  this,  that  an  increase  in  the

productiveness of labor causes a fall in the value of labor power and a

consequent rise in surplus value, while, on the other hand, a decrease

in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of labor power, and

a fall in surplus value.

    In  formulating  this  law,  Ricardo  overlooked  one  circumstance;

although a change in the magnitude of the surplus value or surplus

labor causes a change in the opposite direction in the magnitude of

the value of labor power, or in the quantity of necessary labor, it by no

means follows that they vary in the same proportion. They do increase

or diminish by the same quantity. But their proportional increase or

diminution depends on their original magnitudes before the change in

the productiveness of labor took place. If the value of the labor power

be 4 shillings, or the necessary labor time 8 hours, and the surplus

value  be  2  shillings,  or  the  surplus  labor  4  hours,  and  if,  in

consequence of an increase in the productiveness of labor, the value

of the labor power fall to 3 shillings, or the necessary labor to 6 hours,

the surplus value will rise to 3 shillings, or the surplus labor to 6 hours.

The same quantity, 1 shilling or 2 hours, is added in one case and

subtracted in the other. But the proportional change of magnitude is

different in each case. While the value of the labor power falls from 4

shillings  to  3,  i.e.,  by  1/4  or  25%,  the  surplus  value  rises  from  2

shillings  to  3,  i.e.,  by  1/2  or  50%.  It  therefore  follows  that  the

proportional increase or diminution in surplus value, consequent on a

given change in the productiveness of labor, depends on the originalmagnitude of that portion of the working day which embodies itself in

surplus value; the smaller that portion, the greater is the proportional

change; the greater that portion, the less is the proportional change.

    (3.) Increase or diminution in surplus value is always consequent

on, and never the cause of, the corresponding diminution or increase

in the value of labor power.

    Since  the  working  day  is  constant  in  magnitude,  and  is

represented  by  a  value  of  constant  magnitude,  since,  to  every

variation  in  the  magnitude  of  surplus  value,  there  corresponds  an

inverse variation in the value of labor power, and since the value of

labor power cannot change, except in consequence of a change in the

productiveness of labor, it clearly follows, under these conditions, that

every change of magnitude in surplus value arises from an inverse

change of magnitude in the value of labor power. If, then, as we have

already seen, there can be no change of absolute magnitude in the

value  of  labor  power,  and  in  surplus  value,  unaccompanied  by  a

change in their relative magnitudes, so now it follows that no change

in their relative magnitudes is possible, without a previous change in

the absolute magnitude of the value of labor power.

    According to the third law, a change in the magnitude of surplus

value, presupposes a movement in the value of labor power, which

movement is brought about by a variation in the productiveness of

labor. The limit of this change is given by the altered value of labor

power.  Nevertheless,  even  when  circumstances  allow  the  law  to

operate,  subsidiary  movements  may  occur.  For  example:  if  in

consequence of the increased productiveness of labor, the value of

labor power falls from 4 shillings to 3, or the necessary labor time from

8 hours to 6, the price of labor power may possibly not fall below 3s.

8d., 3s. 6d., or 3s. 2d., and the surplus value consequently not rise

above 3s. 4d., 3s. 6d., or 3s. 10d. The amount of this fall, the lowest

limit of which is 3 shillings (the new value of labor power), depends on

the relative weight, which the pressure of capital on the one side, and

the resistance of the laborer on the other, throws into the scale.

    The value of labor power is determined by the value of a given

quantity  of  necessaries.  It  is  the  value  and  not  the  mass  of  these

necessaries  that  varies  with  the  productiveness  of  labor.  It  is,

however, possible that, owing to an increase of productiveness, boththe  laborer  and  the  capitalist  may  simultaneously  be  able  to

appropriate  a  greater  quantity  of  these  necessaries,  without  any

change in the price of labor power or in surplus value. If the value of

labor power be 3 shillings, and the necessary labor time amount to 6

hours, if the surplus value likewise be 3 shillings, and the surplus labor

6  hours,  then  if  the  productiveness  of  labor  were  doubled  without

altering the ratio of necessary labor to surplus labor, there would be

no change of magnitude in surplus value and price of labor power.

The only result would be that each of them would represent twice as

many use values as before; these use values being twice as cheap as

before. Although labor power would be unchanged in price, it would be

above its value. If, however, the price of labor power had fallen, not to

1s. 6d., the lowest possible point consistent with its new value, but to

2s. 10d. or 2s. 6d., still this lower price would represent an increased

mass  of  necessaries.  In  this  way  it  is  possible  with  an  increasing

productiveness of labor, for the price of labor power to keep on falling,

and yet this fall to be accompanied by a constant growth in the mass

of the laborer’s means of subsistence. But even in such case, the fall

in  the  value  of  labor  power  would  cause  a  corresponding  rise  of

surplus value, and thus the abyss between the laborer’s position and

that of the capitalist would keep widening.

    Ricardo was the first who accurately formulated the three laws we

have above stated. But he falls into the following errors: (1) he looks

upon the special conditions under which these laws hold good as the

general  and  sole  conditions  of  capitalist  production.  He  knows  no

change, either in the length of the working day, or in the intensity of

labor; consequently, with him there can be only one variable factor,

viz., the productiveness of labor; (2), and this error vitiates his analysis

much  more  than  (1),  he  has  not,  any  more  than  have  the  other

economists, investigated surplus value as such, i.e., independently of

its particular forms, such as profit, rent, etc. He therefore confounds

together the laws of the rate of surplus value and the laws of the rate

of profit. The rate of profit is, as we have already said, the ratio of the

surplus value to the total capital advanced; the rate of surplus value is

the  ratio  of  the  surplus  value  to  the  variable  part  of  that  capital.

Assume  that  a  capital  C  of  £500  is  made  up  of  raw  material,

instruments of labor, etc. (c) to the amount of £400; and of wages (v)to the amount of £100; and further, that the surplus value (s) = £100.

Then we have rate of surplus value s/v = £100/£100 = 100%. But the

rate of profit s/C [= s/(c+v)] = £100/£500 = 20%. It is, besides, obvious

that the rate of profit may depend on circumstances that in no way

affect the rate of surplus value. I shall show in Book III that, with a

given rate of surplus value, we may have any number of rates of profit,

and that various rates of surplus value may, under given conditions,

express themselves in a single rate of profit.



    Section 2. Working Day Constant. Productiveness of Labor

Constant. Intensity of Labor Variable


    Increased intensity of labor means increased expenditure of labor

in  a  given  time.  Hence  a  working  day  of  more  intense  labor  is

embodied  in  more  products  than  is  one  of  less  intense  labor,  the

length of each day being the same. Increased productiveness of labor

also, it is true, will supply more products in a given working day. But in

this latter case, the value of each single product falls, for it costs less

labor than before; in the former case, that value remains unchanged,

for  each  article  costs  the  same  labor  as  before.  Here  we  have  an

increase in the number of products, unaccompanied by a fall in their

individual prices: as their number increases, so does the sum of their

prices. But in the case of increased productiveness, a given value is

spread  over  a  greater  mass  of  products.  Hence  the  length  of  the

working day being constant, a day's labor of increased intensity will be

incorporated in an increased value, and, the value of money remaining

unchanged, in more money.

    The value created varies with the extent to which the intensity of

labor deviates from its normal intensity in the society. A given working

day, therefore, no longer creates a constant, but a variable value; in a

day  of  12  hours  of  ordinary  intensity,  the  value  created  is,  say  6

shillings, but with increased intensity, the value created may be 7, 8,

or more shillings. It is clear that, if the value created by a day’s labor

increases from, say, 6 to 8 shillings then the two parts into which this

value is divided, viz., price of labor power and surplus value, may both

of  them  increase  simultaneously,  and  either  equally  or  unequally.They may both simultaneously increase from 3 shillings to 4. Here, the

rise in the price of labor power does not necessarily imply that the

price has risen above the value of labor power. On the contrary, the

rise  in  price  may  be  accompanied  by  a  fall  in  value.  This  occurs

whenever the rise in the price of labor power does not compensate for

its increased wear and tear.

    We  know  that,  with  transitory  exceptions,  a  change  in  the

productiveness of labor does not cause any change in the value of

labor  power,  nor  consequently  in  the  magnitude  of  surplus  value,

unless the products of the industries affected are articles habitually

consumed by the laborers. In the present case this condition no longer

applies.  For  when  the  variation  is  either  in  the  duration  or  in  the

intensity  of  labor,  there  is  always  a  corresponding  change  in  the

magnitude of the value created, independently of the nature of the

article in which that value is embodied.

    If  the  intensity  of  labor  were  to  increase  simultaneously  and

equally in every branch of industry, then the new and higher degree of

intensity would become the normal degree for the society, and would

therefore  cease  to  be  taken  account  of.  But  still,  even  then,  the

intensity of labor would be different in different countries, and would

modify  the  international  application  of  the  law  of  value.  The  more

intense working day of one nation would be represented by a greater

sum of money than would the less intense day of another nation.



    Section 3. Productiveness and Intensity of Labor Constant.

Length of The Working Day Variable


    The working day may vary in two ways. It may be made either

longer or shorter. From our present data, and within the limits of the

assumptions made above we obtain the following laws:

    (1.) The working day creates a greater or less amount of value in

proportion to its length — thus, a variable and not a constant quantity

of value.

    (2.)  Every  change  in  the  relation  between  the  magnitudes  of

surplus value and of the value of labor power arises from a change inthe absolute magnitude of the surplus labor, and consequently of the

surplus value.

    (3.)  The  absolute  value  of  labor  power  can  change  only  in

consequence of the reaction exercised by the prolongation of surplus

labor upon the wear and tear of labor power. Every change in this

absolute  value  is  therefore  the  effect,  but  never  the  cause,  of  a

change in the magnitude of surplus value.

    We begin with the case in which the working day is shortened.

    (1.) A shortening of the working day under the conditions given

above,  leaves  the  value  of  labor  power,  and  with  it,  the  necessary

labor time, unaltered. It reduces the surplus labor and surplus value.

Along with the absolute magnitude of the latter, its relative magnitude

also  falls,  i.e.,  its  magnitude  relatively  to  the  value  of  labor  power

whose  magnitude  remains  unaltered.  Only  by  lowering  the  price  of

labor power below its value could the capitalist save himself harmless.

    All the usual arguments against the shortening of the working day,

assume  that  it  takes  place  under  the  conditions  we  have  here

supposed to exist; but in reality the very contrary is the case: a change

in  the  productiveness  and  intensity  of  labor  either  precedes,  or

immediately follows, a shortening of the working day.

    (2.) Lengthening of the working day. Let the necessary labor time

be 6 hours, or the value of labor power 3 shillings; also let the surplus

labor be 6 hours or the surplus value 3 shillings. The whole working

day  then  amounts  to  12  hours  and  is  embodied  in  a  value  of  6

shillings. If, now, the working day be lengthened by 2 hours and the

price  of  labor  power  remain  unaltered,  the  surplus  value  increases

both absolutely and relatively. Although there is no absolute change in

the value of labor power, it suffers a relative fall. Under the conditions

assumed in 1. there could not be a change of relative magnitude in the

value of labor power without a change in its absolute magnitude. Here,

on the contrary, the change of relative magnitude in the value of labor

power is the result of the change of absolute magnitude in surplus

value.

    Since the value in which a day’s labor is embodied, increases with

the length of that day, it is evident that the surplus value and the price

of  labor  power  may  simultaneously  increase,  either  by  equal  or

unequal quantities. This simultaneous increase is therefore possible intwo cases, one, the actual lengthening of the working day, the other,

an  increase  in  the  intensity  of  labor  unaccompanied  by  such

lengthening.

    When the working day is prolonged, the price of labor power may

fall below its value, although that price be nominally unchanged or

even rise. The value of a day’s labor power is, as will be remembered,

estimated  from  its  normal  average  duration,  or  from  the  normal

duration of life among the laborers, and from corresponding normal

transformations of organized bodily matter into motion, in conformity

with the nature of man. Up to a certain point, the increased wear and

tear of labor power, inseparable from a lengthened working day, may

be compensated by higher wages. But beyond this point the wear and

tear  increases  in  geometrical  progression,  and  every  condition

suitable for the normal reproduction and functioning of labor power is

suppressed.  The  price  of  labor  power  and  the  degree  of  its

exploitation cease to be commensurable quantities.



    Section  4.  Simultaneous  Variations  in  The  Duration,

Productiveness, And Intensity of Labor


    It  is  obvious  that  a  large  number  of  combinations  are  here

possible.  Any  two  of  the  factors  may  vary  and  the  third  remain

constant, or all three may vary at once. They may vary either in the

same or in different degrees, in the same or in opposite directions,

with the result that the variations counteract one another, either wholly

or in part. Nevertheless, the analysis of every possible case is easy in

view of the results given [in sections 1, 2 and 3]. The effect of every

possible combination may be found by treating each factor in turn as

variable,  and  the  other  two  constant  for  the  time  being.  We  shall,

therefore, notice, and that briefly, but two important cases.

    (1.) Diminishing productiveness of labor with a simultaneous

lengthening of the working day

    In speaking of diminishing productiveness of labor, we here refer

to diminution in those industries whose products determine the value

of  labor  power;  such  a  diminution,  for  example,  as  results  from

decreasing fertility of the soil, and from the corresponding dearness ofits products. Take the working day at 12 hours and the value created

by it at 6 shillings, of which one half replaces the value of the labor

power, the other forms the surplus value. Suppose, in consequence of

the increased dearness of the products of the soil, that the value of

labor power rises from 3 shillings to 4, and therefore the necessary

labor time from 6 hours to 8. If there be no change in the length of the

working day, the surplus labor would fall from 6 hours to 4, the surplus

value from 3 shillings to 2. If the day be lengthened by 2 hours, i.e.,

from 12 hours to 14, the surplus labor remains at 6 hours, the surplus

value at 3 shillings, but the surplus value decreases compared with

the value of labor power, as measured by the necessary labor time. If

the  day  be  lengthened  by  4  hours,  viz.,  from  12  hours  to  16,  the

proportional magnitudes of surplus value and value of labor power, of

surplus  labor  and  necessary  labor,  continue  unchanged,  but  the

absolute magnitude of surplus value rises from 3 shillings to 4, that of

the  surplus  labor  from  6  hours  to  8,  an  increment  of  33  1/3%.

Therefore,  with  diminishing  productiveness  of  labor  and  a

simultaneous lengthening of the working day, the absolute magnitude

of  surplus  value  may  continue  unaltered,  at  the  same  time  that  its

relative  magnitude  diminishes;  its  relative  magnitude  may  continue

unchanged, at the same time that its absolute magnitude increases;

and,  provided  the  lengthening  of  the  day  be  sufficient,  both  may

increase.

    (2.)  Increasing  intensity  and  productiveness  of  labor  with

simultaneous shortening of the working day

    Increased productiveness and greater intensity of labor, both have

a like effect. They both augment the mass of articles produced in a

given time. Both, therefore, shorten that portion of the working day

which the laborer needs to produce his means of subsistence or their

equivalent. The minimum length of the working day is fixed by this

necessary but contractile portion of it. If the whole working day were to

shrink  to  the  length  of  this  portion,  surplus  labor  would  vanish,  a

consummation utterly impossible under the régime of capital. Only by

suppressing the capitalist form of production could the length of the

working day be reduced to the necessary labor time. But, even in that

case, the latter would extend its limits. On the one hand, because the

notion of “means of subsistence” would considerably expand, and thelaborer would lay claim to an altogether different standard of life. On

the other hand, because a part of what is now surplus labor, would

then count as necessary labor; I mean the labor of forming a fund for

reserve and accumulation.

    The more the productiveness of labor increases, the more can the

working day be shortened; and the more the working day is shortened,

the more can the intensity of labor increase. From a social point of

view, the productiveness increases in the same ratio as the economy

of labor, which, in its turn, includes not only economy of the means of

production, but also the avoidance of all useless labor. The capitalist

mode  of  production,  while  on  the  one  hand,  enforcing  economy  in

each individual business, on the other hand, begets, by its anarchical

system  of  competition,  the  most  outrageous  squandering  of  labor

power  and  of  the  social  means  of  production,  not  to  mention  the

creation of a vast number of employments, at present indispensable,

but in themselves superfluous.

    The intensity and productiveness of labor being given, the time

which society is bound to devote to material production is shorter, and

as a consequence, the time at its disposal for the free development,

intellectual and social, of the individual is greater, in proportion as the

work  is  more  and  more  evenly  divided  among  all  the  able-bodied

members  of  society,  and  as  a  particular  class  is  more  and  more

deprived of the power to shift the natural burden of labor from its own

shoulders to those of another layer of society. In this direction, the

shortening of the working day finds at last a limit in the generalization

of labor. In capitalist society spare time is acquired for one class by

converting the whole life-time of the masses into labor time.      Chapter 18: Various Formulae for The Rate of Surplus Value



    We have seen that the rate of surplus value is represented by the

following formulae:

 




 

    The two first of these formulae represent, as a ratio of values, that

which, in the third, is represented as a ratio of the times during which

those values are produced. These formulae, supplementary the one to

the other, are rigorously definite and correct [...]

    There  is  [another]  formula  which  I  have  occasionally  already

anticipated; it is

 




 

    After  the  investigations  we  have  given  above,  it  is  no  longer

possible to be misled, by the formula

 



 

    into concluding, that the capitalist pays for labor and not for labor

power. This formula is only a popular expression for

 



 

    The capitalist pays the value, so far as price coincides with value,

of the labor power, and receives in exchange the disposal of the livinglabor power itself. His usufruct is spread over two periods. During one

the laborer produces a value that is only equal to the value of his labor

power; he produces its equivalent. This the capitalist receives in return

for his advance of the price of the labor power, a product ready made

in the market. During the other period, the period of surplus labor, the

usufruct of the labor power creates a value for the capitalist, that costs

him  no  equivalent.  This  expenditure  of  labor  power  comes  to  him

gratis. In this sense it is that surplus labor can be called unpaid labor.

    Capital, therefore, it not only, as Adam Smith says, the command

over labor. It is essentially the command over unpaid labor. All surplus

value,  whatever  particular  form  (profit,  interest,  or  rent),  it  may

subsequently  crystallize  into,  is  in  substance  the  materialization  of

unpaid labor. The secret of the self-expansion of capital resolves itself

into having the disposal of a definite quantity of other people’s unpaid

labor.                                  PART 6: WAGES            Chapter 19: The Transformation of the Value (And

          Respectively the Price) Of Labor Power into Wages



    That  which  comes  directly  face  to  face  with  the  possessor  of

money on the market, is in fact not labor, but the laborer. What the

latter sells is his labor power. As soon as his labor actually begins, it

has already ceased to belong to him; it can therefore no longer be

sold by him. Labor is the substance, and the immanent measure of

value,  but  has  itself  no  value  [...]  What  [bourgeois]  economists

therefore call value of labor, is in fact the value of labor power, as it

exists in the personality of the laborer, which is as different from its

function, labor, as a machine is from the work it performs [...]

    Let us next see how value (and price) of labor power, present

themselves in this transformed condition as wages. We know that the

daily value of labor power is calculated upon a certain length of the

laborer’s life, to which, again, corresponds a certain length of working

day. Assume the habitual working day as 12 hours, the daily value of

labor power as 3s., the expression in money of a value that embodies

6 hours of labor. If the laborer receives 3s., then he receives the value

of his labor power functioning through 12 hours [...]                              Chapter 20: Time Wages



    Wages  themselves  again  take  many  forms,  a  fact  not

recognizable  in  the  ordinary  economic  treatises  which,  exclusively

interested in the material side of the question, neglect every difference

of  form.  An  exposition  of  all  these  forms  however,  belongs  to  the

special study of wage labor, not therefore to this work. Still the two

fundamental forms must be briefly worked out here.

    The sale of labor power, as will be remembered, takes place for a

definite  period  of  time.  The  converted  form  under  which  the  daily,

weekly, etc., value of labor power presents itself, is hence that of time

wages, therefore day wages, etc.

    Next it is to be noted that the laws set forth, in the 17th Chapter,

on the changes in the relative magnitudes of price of labor power and

surplus value, pass by a simple transformation of form, into laws of

wages. Similarly, the distinction between the exchange value of labor

power, and the sum of the necessaries of life into which this value is

converted, now reappears as the distinction between nominal and real

wages.  It  would  be  useless  to  repeat  here,  with  regard  to  the

phenomenal  form,  what  has  been  already  worked  out  in  the

substantial  form.  We  limit  ourselves  therefore  to  a  few  points

characteristic of time wages.

    The  sum  of  money  which  the  laborer  receives  for  his  daily  or

weekly labor, forms the amount of his nominal wages, or of his wages

estimated in value. But it is clear that according to the length of the

working  day,  that  is,  according  to  the  amount  of  actual  labor  daily

supplied, the same daily or weekly wage may represent very different

prices of labor, i.e., very different sums of money for the same quantity

of  labor.  We  must,  therefore,  in  considering  time  wages,  again

distinguish between the sum-total of the daily or weekly wages, etc.,

and the price of labor. How then, to find this price, i.e., the money

value of a given quantity of labor? The average price of labor is found,

when  the  average  daily  value  of  the  labor  power  is  divided  by  theaverage number of hours in the working day. If, e.g., the daily value of

labor power is 3 shillings, the value of the product of 6 working hours,

and if the working day is 12 hours, the price of 1 working hour is 3/12

shillings = 3d. The price of the working hour thus found serves as the

unit measure for the price of labor.

    It  follows  therefore  that  the  daily  and  weekly  wages,  etc.,  may

remain the same, although the price of labor falls constantly. If, e.g.,

the habitual working day is 10 hours and the daily value of the labor

power 3s., the price of the working hour is 3 3/5d. It falls to 3s. as

soon as the working day rises to 12 hours, to 2 2/5d. as soon as it

rises  to  15  hours.  Daily  or  weekly  wages  remain,  despite  all  this,

unchanged.  On  the  contrary,  the  daily  or  weekly  wages  may  rise,

although the price of labor remains constant or even falls. If, e.g., the

working day is 10 hours, and the daily value of labor power 3 shillings,

the price of one working hour is 3 3/5d. If the laborer, in consequence

of increase of trade, works 12 hours, the price of labor remaining the

same,  his  daily  wage  now  rises  to  3  shillings  7  1/5  d.  without  any

variation in the price of labor. The same result might follow if, instead

of the extensive amount of labor, its intensive amount increased. The

rise  of  the  nominal  daily  or  weekly  wages  may  therefore  be

accompanied by a price of labor that remains stationary or falls. The

same holds as to the income of the laborer’s family, as soon as the

quantity of labor expended by the head of the family is increased by

the labor of the members of his family. There are, therefore, methods

of  lowering  the  price  of  labor  independent  of  the  reduction  of  the

nominal daily or weekly wages.

    As  a  general  law  it  follows  that,  given  the  amount  of  daily  or

weekly labor, etc., the daily or weekly wages depend on the price of

labor which itself varies either with the value of labor power, or with

the  difference  between  its  price  and  its  value.  Given,  on  the  other

hand, the price of labor, the daily or weekly wages depend on the

quantity of the daily or weekly labor.

    The unit-measure for time wages, the price of the working hour, is

the quotient of the value of a day’s labor power, divided by the number

of hours of the average working day. Let the latter be 12 hours, and

the daily value of labor power 3 shillings, the value of the product of 6

hours of labor. Under these circumstances the price of a working houris 3d.; the value produced in it is 6d. If the laborer is now employed

less than 12 hours (or less than 6 days in the week), e.g., only 6 or 8

hours, he receives, with this price of labor, only 2s. or 1s. 6d. a day.

As on our hypothesis he must work on the average 6 hours daily, in

order to produce a day’s wage corresponding merely to the value of

his labor power, as according to the same hypothesis he works only

half of every hour for himself, and half for the capitalist, it is clear that

he cannot obtain for himself the value of the product of 6 hours if he is

employed  less  than  12  hours.  In  previous  Chapters  we  saw  the

destructive consequences of overwork; here we find the sources of

the  sufferings  that  result  to  the  laborer  from  his  insufficient

employment.

    If  the  hour’s  wage  is  fixed  so  that  the  capitalist  does  not  bind

himself to pay a day’s or a week’s wage, but only to pay wages for the

hours during which he chooses to employ the laborer, he can employ

him for a shorter time than that which is originally the basis of the

calculation of the hour wage, or the unit-measure of the price of labor.

Since  this  unit  is  determined  by  the  ratio  [  (daily  value  of  labor

power)/(working day of a given number of hours) ] it, of course, loses

all meaning as soon as the working day ceases to contain a definite

number of hours. The connection between the paid and the unpaid

labor  is  destroyed.  The  capitalist  can  now  wring  from  the  labor  a

certain quantity of surplus labor without allowing him the labor time

necessary for his own subsistence. He can annihilate all regularity of

employment, and according to his own convenience, caprice, and the

interest of the moment, make the most enormous overwork alternate

with relative or absolute cessation of work. He can, under the pretense

of paying “the normal price of labor”, abnormally lengthen the working

day without any corresponding compensation to the laborer. Hence

the perfectly rational revolt in 1860 of the London laborers, employed

in the building trades, against the attempt of the capitalists to impose

on them this sort of wage by the hour [...]

    The capitalist does not know that the normal price of labor also

includes a definite quantity of unpaid labor, and that this very unpaid

labor is the normal source of his gain. The category of surplus labor

time does not exist at all for him, since it is included in the normal

working day, which he thinks he has paid for in the day’s wages. Butover-time  does  exist  for  him,  the  prolongation  of  the  working  day

beyond the limits corresponding with the usual price of labor. Face to

face with his underselling competitor, he even insists upon extra pay

for this overtime. He again does not know that this extra pay includes

unpaid labor, just as well as does the price of the customary hour of

labor. For example, the price of one hour of the 12 hours’ working day

is 3d., say the value product of half a working hour, whilst the price of

the  overtime  working  hour  is  4d.,  or  the  value  product  of  2/3  of  a

working hour. In the first case the capitalist appropriates to himself

one-half, in the second, one-third of the working hour without paying

for it.                              Chapter 21: Piece Wages



    Wages by the piece are nothing else than a converted form of

wages by time, just as wages by time are a converted form of the

value or price of labor power.

    In piece wages it seems at first sight as if the use value bought

from the laborer was, not the function of his labor power, living labor,

but labor already realized in the product, and as if the price of this

labor was determined, not as with time wages, by the fraction [ (daily

value of labor power)/(the working day of a given number of hours) ]

but by the capacity for work of the producer.

    The confidence that trusts in this appearance ought to receive a

first severe shock from the fact that both forms of wages exist side by

side,  simultaneously,  in  the  same  branches  of  industry  [...]  In  the

regular  factories  in  which  throughout  piece  wages  predominate,

particular kinds of work are unsuitable to this form of wage, and are

therefore  paid  by  time.  But  it  is,  moreover,  self-evident  that  the

difference  of  form  in  the  payment  of  wages  alters  in  no  way  their

essential nature, although the one form may be more favorable to the

development of capitalist production than the other.

    Let the ordinary working day contain 12 hours of which 6 are paid,

6 unpaid. Let its value product be 6 shillings, that of one hour’s labor

therefore  6d.  Let  us  suppose  that,  as  the  result  of  experience,  a

laborer who works with the average amount of intensity and skill, who,

therefore,  gives  in  fact  only  the  time  socially  necessary  to  the

production of an article, supplies in 12 hours 24 pieces, either distinct

products or measurable parts of a continuous whole. Then the value

of these 24 pieces, after. subtraction of the portion of constant capital

contained in them, is 6 shillings, and the value of a single piece 3d.

The laborer receives 1 d. per piece, and thus earns in 12 hours 3
                              1/2

shillings.  Just  as,  with  time  wages,  it  does  not  matter  whether  we

assume that the laborer works 6 hours for himself and 6 hours for the

capitalist, or half of every hour for himself, and the other half for thecapitalist,  so  here  it  does  not  matter  whether  we  say  that  each

individual piece is half paid, and half unpaid for, or that the price of 12

pieces is the equivalent only of the value of the labor power, whilst in

the other 12 pieces surplus value is incorporated.

    The form of piece wages is just as irrational as that of time wages.

Whilst in our example two pieces of a commodity, after subtraction of

the value of the means of production consumed in them, are worth 6d.

as being the product of one hour, the laborer receives for them a price

of 3d. Piece wages do not, in fact, distinctly express any relation of

value. It is not, therefore, a question of measuring the value of the

piece by the working time incorporated in it, but on the contrary, of

measuring the working time the laborer has expended by the number

of pieces he has produced. In time wages, the labor is measured by

its immediate duration; in piece wages, by the quantity of products in

which the labor has embodied itself during a given time. The price of

labor time itself is finally determined by the equation: value of a day’s

labor = daily value of labor power. Piece wage is, therefore, only a

modified form of time wage.

    Let  us  now  consider  a  little  more  closely  the  characteristic

peculiarities of piece wages.

    The quality of the labor is here controlled by the work itself, which

must be of average perfection if the piece price is to be paid in full.

Piece wages become, from this point of view, the most fruitful source

of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating. They furnish to the

capitalist an exact measure for the intensity of labor. Only the working

time  which  is  embodied  in  a  quantum  of  commodities  determined

beforehand,  and  experimentally  fixed,  counts  as  socially  necessary

working time, and is paid as such [...]

    Given  piece  wage,  it  is  naturally  the  personal  interest  of  the

laborer to strain his labor power as intensely as possible; this enables

the capitalist to raise more easily the normal degree of intensity of

labor.  It  is  moreover  now  the  personal  interest  of  the  laborer  to

lengthen the working day, since with it his daily or weekly wages rise.

This gradually brings on a reaction like that already described in time

wages,  without  reckoning  that  the  prolongation  of  the  working  day,

even if the piece wage remains constant, includes of necessity a fall in

the price of the labor.    In time wages, with few exceptions, the same wage holds for the

same  kind  of  work,  whilst  in  piece  wages,  though  the  price  of  the

working time is measured by a certain quantity of product, the day’s or

week’s wage will vary with the individual differences of the laborers, of

whom  one  supplies  in  a  given  time  the  minimum  of  product  only,

another the average, a third more than the average. With regard to

actual  receipts  there  is,  therefore,  great  variety  according  to  the

different skill, strength, energy, staying power, etc., of the individual

laborers. Of course this does not alter the general relations between

capital and wage labor. First, the individual differences balance one

another in the workshop as a whole, which thus supplies in a given

working time the average product, and the total wages paid will be the

average  wages  of  that  particular  branch  of  industry.  Second,  the

proportion between wages and surplus value remains unaltered, since

the  mass  of  surplus  labor  supplied  by  each  particular  laborer

corresponds with the wage received by him. But the wider scope that

piece wage gives to individuality tends to develop on the one hand

that individuality, and with it the sense of liberty, independence, and

self-control of the laborers, and on the other, their competition one

with  another.  Piece  work  has,  therefore,  a  tendency,  while  raising

individual wages above the average, to lower this average itself. But

where a particular rate of piece wage has for a long time been fixed by

tradition, and its lowering, therefore, presented especial difficulties, the

masters, in such exceptional cases, sometimes had recourse to its

compulsory  transformation  into  time  wages.  Hence,  e.g.,  in  1860  a

great  strike  among  the  ribbon-weavers  of  Coventry.  Piece  wage  is

finally one of the chief supports of the hour-system described in the

preceding Chapter.

    From what has been shown so far, it follows that piece wage is

the  form  of  wages  most  in  harmony  with  the  capitalist  mode  of

production [...]

    With the changing productiveness of labor, the same quantum of

product represents a varying working time. Therefore, piece wage also

varies, for it is the money expression of a determined working time. In

our example above, 24 pieces were produced in 12 hours, whilst the

value of the product of the 12 hours was 6s., the daily value of the

labor power 3s., the price of the labor-hour 3d., and the wage for onepiece d. In one piece half-an-hour’s labor was absorbed. If the same
      1/2

working  day  now  supplies,  in  consequence  of  the  doubled

productiveness  of  labor,  48  pieces  instead  of  24,  and  all  other

circumstances remain unchanged, then the piece wage falls from 1

1/2d. to 3/4d., as every piece now only represents 1/4, instead of a

working hour. 24 by 1d. = 3s., and in like manner 48 by 3/4d. = 3s.
                            1/2

In other words, piece wage is lowered in the same proportion as the

number of the pieces produced in the same time rises, and, therefore,

as the working time spent on the same piece falls. This change in

piece wage, so far purely nominal, leads to constant battles between

capitalist and labor. Either because the capitalist uses it as a pretext

for  actually  lowering  the  price  of  labor,  or  because  increased

productive power of labor is accompanied by an increased intensity of

the same. Or because the laborer takes seriously the appearance of

piece wages (viz., that his product is paid for, and not his labor power)

and therefore revolts against a lowering of wages, unaccompanied by

a lowering in the selling price of the commodity [.]                  Chapter 22: National Differences of Wages



    In  the  17th  Chapter  we  were  occupied  with  the  manifold

combinations which may bring about a change in magnitude of the

value  of  labor  power  —  this  magnitude  being  considered  either

absolutely or relatively, i.e., as compared with surplus value; whilst on

the other hand, the quantum of the means of subsistence in which the

price of labor is realized might again undergo fluctuations independent

of, or different from, the changes of this price. As has been already

said, the simple translation of the value, or respectively of the price, of

labor power into the exoteric form of wages transforms all these laws

into laws of the fluctuations of wages. That which appears in these

fluctuations of wages within a single country as a series of varying

combinations, may appear in different countries as contemporaneous

difference  of  national  wages.  In  the  comparison  of  the  wages  in

different nations, we must therefore take into account all the factors

that determine changes in the amount of the value of labor power; the

price and the extent of the prime necessaries of life as naturally and

historically developed, the cost of training the laborers, the part played

by the labor of women and children, the productiveness of labor, its

extensive  and  intensive  magnitude.  Even  the  most  superficial

comparison requires the reduction first of the average day wage for

the same trades, in different countries, to a uniform working day. After

this reduction to the same terms of the day wages, time wage must

again  be  translated  into  piece  wage,  as  the  latter  only  can  be  a

measure both of the productivity and the intensity of labor.

    In every country there is a certain average intensity of labor below

which the labor for the production of a commodity requires more than

the socially necessary time, and therefore does not reckon as labor of

normal quality. Only a degree of intensity above the national average

affects, in a given country, the measure of value by the mere duration

of  the  working  time.  This  is  not  the  case  on  the  universal  market,

whose  integral  parts  are  the  individual  countries.  The  averageintensity of labor changes from country to country; here it is greater,

there  less.  These  national  averages  form  a  scale;  whose  unit  of

measure  is  the  average  unit  of  universal  labor.  The  more  intense

national labor, therefore, as compared with the less intense, produces

in the same time more value, which expresses itself in more money.

    But  the  law  of  value  in  its  international  application  is  yet  more

modified  by  the  fact  that  on  the  world  market  the  more  productive

national labor reckons also as the more intense, so long as the more

productive nation is not compelled by competition to lower the selling

price of its commodities to the level of their value.

    In proportion as capitalist production is developed in a country, in

the same proportion do the national intensity and productivity of labor

there  rise  above  the  international  level.  The  different  quantities  of

commodities of the same kind, produced in different countries in the

same  working  time,  have,  therefore,  unequal  international  values,

which are expressed in different prices, i.e., in sums of money varying

according  to  international  values.  The  relative  value  of  money  will,

therefore, be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of

production than in the nation with less developed. It follows, then, that

the  nominal  wages,  the  equivalent  of  labor  power  expressed  in

money, will also be higher in the first nation than in the second; which

does not at all prove that this holds also for the real wages, i.e., for the

means of subsistence placed at the disposal of the laborer.

    But  even  apart  from  these  relative  differences  of  the  value  of

money in different countries, it will be found, frequently, that the daily

or weekly, etc., wage in the first nation is higher than in the second,

whilst the relative price of labor, i.e., the price of labor as compared

both  with  surplus  value  and  with  the  value  of  the  product,  stands

higher in the second than in the first [...]            PART 7: THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL



    The conversion of a sum of money into means of production and

labor power, is the first step taken by the quantum of value that is

going to function as capital. This conversion takes place in the market,

within  the  sphere  of  circulation.  The  second  step,  the  process  of

production,  is  complete  so  soon  as  the  means  of  production  have

been converted into commodities whose value exceeds that of their

component  parts,  and,  therefore,  contains  the  capital  originally

advanced,  plus  a  surplus  value.  These  commodities  must  then  be

thrown  into  circulation.  They  must  be  sold,  their  value  realized  in

money, this money afresh converted into capital, and so over and over

again.  This  circular  movement,  in  which  the  same  phases  are

continually  gone  through  in  succession,  forms  the  circulation  of

capital.

    The first condition of accumulation is that the capitalist must have

contrived  to  sell  his  commodities,  and  to  reconvert  into  capital  the

greater part of the money so received. In the following pages we shall

assume that capital circulates in its normal way. The detailed analysis

of the process will be found in Book II.

    The capitalist who produces surplus value — i.e., who extracts

unpaid labor directly from the laborers, and fixes it in commodities, is,

indeed, the first appropriator, but by no means the ultimate owner, of

this surplus value. He has to share it with capitalists, with landowners,

etc.,  who  fulfil  other  functions  in  the  complex  of  social  production.

Surplus value, therefore, splits up into various parts. Its fragments fall

to various categories of persons, and take various forms, independent

the one of the other, such as profit, interest, merchants’ profit, rent,

etc. It is only in Book III that we can take in hand these modified forms

of surplus value.

    On the one hand, then, we assume that the capitalist sells at their

value the commodities he has produced, without concerning ourselves

either about the new forms that capital assumes while in the sphere ofcirculation,  or  about  the  concrete  conditions  of  reproduction  hidden

under these forms. On the other hand, we treat the capitalist producer

as  owner  of  the  entire  surplus  value,  or,  better  perhaps,  as  the

representative of all the sharers with him in the booty. We, therefore,

first of all consider accumulation from an abstract point of view — i.e.,

as a mere phase in the actual process of production.

    So  far  as  accumulation  takes  place,  the  capitalist  must  have

succeeded in selling his commodities, and in reconverting the sale-

money into capital. Moreover, the breaking-up of surplus value into

fragments neither alters its nature nor the conditions under which it

becomes an element of accumulation. Whatever be the proportion of

surplus  value  which  the  industrial  capitalist  retains  for  himself,  or

yields  up  to  others,  he  is  the  one  who,  in  the  first  instance,

appropriates  it.  We,  therefore,  assume  no  more  than  what  actually

takes place. On the other hand, the simple fundamental form of the

process of accumulation is obscured by the incident of the circulation

which brings it about, and by the splitting up of surplus value. An exact

analysis of the process, therefore, demands that we should, for a time,

disregard all phenomena that hide the play of its inner mechanism.                        Chapter 23: Simple Reproduction



    Whatever the form of the process of production in a society, it

must  be  a  continuous  process,  must  continue  to  go  periodically

through the same phases. A society can no more cease to produce

than  it  can  cease  to  consume.  When  viewed,  therefore,  as  a

connected  whole,  and  as  flowing  on  with  incessant  renewal,  every

social  process  of  production  is,  at  the  same  time,  a  process  of

reproduction.

    The conditions of production are also those of reproduction. No

society  can  go  on  producing,  in  other  words,  no  society  can

reproduce, unless it constantly reconverts a part of its products into

means  of  production,  or  elements  of  fresh  products.  All  other

circumstances  remaining  the  same,  the  only  mode  by  which  it  can

reproduce its wealth, and maintain it at one level, is by replacing the

means of production — i.e., the instruments of labor, the raw material,

and the auxiliary substances consumed in the course of the year — by

an  equal  quantity  of  the  same  kind  of  articles;  these  must  be

separated from the mass of the yearly products, and thrown afresh

into the process of production. Hence, a definite portion of each year’s

product belongs to the domain of production. Destined for productive

consumption from the very first, this portion exists, for the most part, in

the shape of articles totally unfitted for individual consumption.

    If production be capitalistic in form, so, too, will be reproduction.

Just as in the former the labor process figures but as a means towards

the self-expansion of capital, so in the latter it figures but as a means

of reproducing as capital — i.e., as self-expanding value — the value

advanced. It is only because his money constantly functions as capital

that  the  economic  guise  of  a  capitalist  attaches  to  a  man.  If,  for

instance, a sum of £100 has this year been converted into capital, and

produced a surplus value of £20, it must continue during next year,

and subsequent years, to repeat the same operation. As a periodic

increment  of  the  capital  advanced,  or  periodic  fruit  of  capital  inprocess, surplus value acquires the form of a revenue flowing out of

capital.

    If this revenue serves the capitalist only as a fund to provide for

his consumption, and be spent as periodically as it is gained, then,

caeteris paribus, simple reproduction will take place [...]

    The purchase of labor power for a fixed period is the prelude to

the  process  of  production;  and  this  prelude  is  constantly  repeated

when the stipulated term comes to an end, when a definite period of

production, such as a week or a month, has elapsed. But the laborer

is not paid until after he has expended his labor power, and realized in

commodities not only its value, but surplus value. He has, therefore,

produced not only surplus value, which we for the present regard as a

fund to meet the private consumption of the capitalist, but he has also

produced, before it flows back to him in the shape of wages, the fund

out  of  which  he  himself  is  paid,  the  variable  capital;  and  his

employment lasts only so long as he continues to reproduce this fund.

Hence,  that  formula  of  the  economists,  referred  to  in  Chapter  23,

which represents wages as a share in the product itself. What flows

back to the laborer in the shape of wages is a portion of the product

that is continuously reproduced by him. The capitalist, it is true, pays

him in money, but this money is merely the transmuted form of the

product of his labor. While he is converting a portion of the means of

production  into  products,  a  portion  of  his  former  product  is  being

turned into money. It is his labor of last week, or of last year, that pays

for his labor power this week or this year. The illusion begotten by the

intervention  of  money  vanishes  immediately,  if,  instead  of  taking  a

single capitalist and a single laborer, we take the class of capitalists

and the class of laborers as a whole. The capitalist class is constantly

giving to the laboring class order-notes, in the form of money, on a

portion of the commodities produced by the latter and appropriated by

the  former.  The  laborers  give  these  order-notes  back  just  as

constantly to the capitalist class, and in this way get their share of their

own product. The transaction is veiled by the commodity form of the

product and the money form of the commodity [...]

    When treating of the working day, we saw that the laborer is often

compelled  to  make  his  individual  consumption  a  mere  incident  of

production. In such a case, he supplies himself with necessaries inorder to maintain his labor power, just as coal and water are supplied

to the steam-engine and oil to the wheel. His means of consumption,

in that case, are the mere means of consumption required by a means

of  production;  his  individual  consumption  is  directly  productive

consumption. This, however, appears to be an abuse not essentially

appertaining to capitalist production.

    The matter takes quite another aspect, when we contemplate, not

the single capitalist, and the single laborer, but the capitalist class and

the laboring class, not an isolated process of production, but capitalist

production in full swing, and on its actual social scale. By converting

part of his capital into labor power, the capitalist augments the value of

his entire capital. He kills two birds with one stone. He profits, not only

by what he receives from, but by what he gives to, the laborer. The

capital  given  in  exchange  for  labor  power  is  converted  into

necessaries,  by  the  consumption  of  which  the  muscles,  nerves,

bones,  and  brains  of  existing  laborers  are  reproduced,  and  new

laborers are begotten. Within the limits of what is strictly necessary,

the  individual  consumption  of  the  working  class  is,  therefore,  the

reconversion  of  the  means  of  subsistence  given  by  capital  in

exchange for labor power, into fresh labor power at the disposal of

capital for exploitation. It is the production and reproduction of that

means  of  production  so  indispensable  to  the  capitalist:  the  laborer

himself. The individual consumption of the laborer, whether it proceed

within the workshop or outside it, whether it be part of the process of

production  or  not,  forms  therefore  a  factor  of  the  production  and

reproduction of capital; just as cleaning machinery does, whether it be

done while the machinery is working or while it is standing.

    The fact that the laborer consumes his means of subsistence for

his own purposes, and not to please the capitalist, has no bearing on

the matter. The consumption of food by a beast of burden is none the

less  a  necessary  factor  in  the  process  of  production,  because  the

beast enjoys what it eats. The maintenance and reproduction of the

working  class  is,  and  must  ever  be,  a  necessary  condition  to  the

reproduction of capital. But the capitalist may safely leave its fulfilment

to the laborer’s instincts of self-preservation and of propagation. All

the  capitalist  cares  for,  is  to  reduce  the  laborer’s  individual

consumption as far as possible to what is strictly necessary, and he isfar away from imitating those brutal South Americans, who force their

laborers to take the more substantial, rather than the less substantial,

kind of food.

    Hence both the capitalist and his ideological representative, the

political economist, consider that part alone of the laborer’s individual

consumption to be productive, which is requisite for the perpetuation

of the class, and which therefore must take place in order that the

capitalist  may  have  labor  power  to  consume;  what  the  laborer

consumes  for  his  own  pleasure  beyond  that  part,  is  unproductive

consumption. If the accumulation of capital were to cause a rise of

wages and an increase in the laborer’s consumption, unaccompanied

by  increase  in  the  consumption  of  labor  power  by  capital,  the

additional capital would be consumed unproductively. In reality, the

individual  consumption  of  the  laborer  is  unproductive  as  regards

himself,  for  it  reproduces  nothing  but  the  needy  individual;  it  is

productive to the capitalist and to the State, since it is the production

of the power that creates their wealth [...]

    Capitalist production, therefore, under its aspect of a continuous

connected process, of a process of reproduction, produces not only

commodities,  not  only  surplus  value,  but  it  also  produces  and

reproduces the capitalist relation; on the one side the capitalist, on the

other the wage laborer [...]          Chapter 24: Conversion of Surplus Value Into Capital



    Section  1.  Capitalist  Production  On  a  Progressively

Increasing  Scale.  Transition  of  The  Laws  of  Property  That

Characterize Production of Commodities into Laws of Capitalist

Appropriation


    Hitherto we have investigated how surplus value emanates from

capital; we have now to see how capital arises from surplus value.

Employing  surplus  value  as  capital,  reconverting  it  into  capital,  is

called accumulation of capital.

    First let us consider this transaction from the standpoint of the

individual capitalist. Suppose a spinner to have advanced a capital of

£10,000, of which four-fifths (£8,000) are laid out in cotton, machinery,

etc., and one-fifth (£2,000) in wages. Let him produce 240,000 lbs. of

yarn  annually,  having  a  value  of  £2,000.  The  rate  of  surplus  value

being 100%, the surplus value lies in the surplus or net product of

40,000 lbs. of yarn, one-sixth of the gross product, with a value of

£2,000 which will be realized by a sale. £2,000 is £2,000 [...]

    In order to convert this additional sum of £2,000 into capital, the

master-spinner will, all circumstances remaining as before, advance

four-fifths of it (£1,600) in the purchase of cotton, etc., and one-fifth

(£400)  in  the  purchase  of  additional  spinners,  who  will  find  in  the

market the necessaries of life whose value the master has advanced

to them.

    Then the new capital of £2,000 functions in the spinning mill, and

brings in, in its turn, a surplus value of £400.

    The capital value was originally advanced in the money form. The

surplus  value  on  the  contrary  is,  originally,  the  value  of  a  definite

portion of the gross product. If this gross product be sold, converted

into  money,  the  capital  value  regains  its  original  form.  From  this

moment the capital value and the surplus value are both of them sums

of money, and their reconversion into capital takes place in preciselythe  same  way.  The  one,  as  well  as  the  other,  is  laid  out  by  the

capitalist in the purchase of commodities that place him in a position

to  begin  afresh  the  fabrication  of  his  goods,  and  this  time,  on  an

extended scale. But in order to be able to buy those commodities, he

must find them ready in the market.

    His  own  yarns  circulate,  only  because  he  brings  his  annual

product  to  market,  as  all  other  capitalists  likewise  do  with  their

commodities. But these commodities, before coming to market, were

part of the general annual product, part of the total mass of objects of

every kind, into which the sum of the individual capitals, i.e., the total

capital of society, had been converted in the course of the year, and of

which  each  capitalist  had  in  hand  only  an  aliquot  part.  The

transactions  in  the  market  effectuate  only  the  interchange  of  the

individual components of this annual product, transfer them from one

hand to another, but can neither augment the total annual production,

nor alter the nature of the objects produced. Hence the use that can

be made of the total annual product, depends entirely upon its own

composition, but in no way upon circulation.

    The  annual  production  must  in  the  first  place  furnish  all  those

objects (use values) from which the material components of capital,

used up in the course of the year, have to be replaced. Deducting

these there remains the net or surplus product, in which the surplus

value  lies.  And  of  what  does  this  surplus  product  consist?  Only  of

things destined to satisfy the wants and desires of the capitalist class,

things  which,  consequently,  enter  into  the  consumption  fund  of  the

capitalists? Were that the case, the cup of surplus value would be

drained to the very dregs, and nothing but simple reproduction would

ever take place.

    To accumulate it is necessary to convert a portion of the surplus

product into capital. But we cannot, except by a miracle, convert into

capital  anything  but  such  articles  as  can  be  employed  in  the  labor

process (i.e., means of production), and such further articles as are

suitable for the sustenance of the laborer (i.e., means of subsistence).

Consequently,  a  part  of  the  annual  surplus  labor  must  have  been

applied  to  the  production  of  additional  means  of  production  and

subsistence, over and above the quantity of these things required to

replace the capital advanced. In one word, surplus value is convertibleinto  capital  solely  because  the  surplus  product,  whose  value  it  is,

already comprises the material elements of new capital.

    Now in order to allow of these elements actually functioning as

capital, the capitalist class requires additional labor. If the exploitation

of the laborers already employed do not increase, either extensively or

intensively, then additional labor power must be found. For this the

mechanism  of  capitalist  production  provides  beforehand,  by

converting the working class into a class dependent on wages, a class

whose ordinary wages suffice, not only for its maintenance, but for its

increase. It is only necessary for capital to incorporate this additional

labor power, annually supplied by the working class in the shape of

laborers of all ages, with the surplus means of production comprised

in the annual produce, and the conversion of surplus value into capital

is  complete.  From  a  concrete  point  of  view,  accumulation  resolves

itself  into  the  reproduction  of  capital  on  a  progressively  increasing

scale. The circle in which simple reproduction moves, alters its form,

and, to use Sismondi’s expression, changes into a spiral [...]

    We  here  leave  out  of  consideration  the  portion  of  the  surplus

value consumed by the capitalist [.]

    [In  the  example  above,  the]  original  capital  was  formed  by  the

advance of £10,000. How did the owner become possessed of it? “By

his own labor and that of his forefathers”, answer unanimously the

spokesmen  of  Political  Economy.  And,  in  fact,  their  supposition

appears the only one consonant with the laws of the production of

commodities.

    But it is quite otherwise with regard to the additional capital of

£2,000. How that originated we know perfectly well. There is not one

single  atom  of  its  value  that  does  not  owe  its  existence  to  unpaid

labor. The means of production, with which the additional labor power

is incorporated, as well as the necessaries with which the laborers are

sustained, are nothing but component parts of the surplus product, of

the tribute annually exacted from the working class by the capitalist

class  [...]  The  accumulation  of  the  first  additional  capital  of  £2,000

presupposes a value of £10,000 belonging to the capitalist by virtue of

his  “primitive  labor,”  and  advanced  by  him.  The  second  additional

capital  of  £400  presupposes,  on  the  contrary,  only  the  previous

accumulation of the £2,000, of which the £400 is the surplus valuecapitalized. The ownership of past unpaid labor is thenceforth the sole

condition for the appropriation of living unpaid labor on a constantly

increasing scale. The more the capitalist has accumulated, the more is

he able to accumulate [...]

    The relation of exchange subsisting between capitalist and laborer

becomes a mere semblance appertaining to the process of circulation,

a mere form, foreign to the real nature of the transaction, and only

mystifying it. The ever repeated purchase and sale of labor power is

now the mere form; what really takes place is this — the capitalist

again  and  again  appropriates,  without  equivalent,  a  portion  of  the

previously materialized labor of others, and exchanges it for a greater

quantity of living labor [...]

    Nor  does  it  matter  if  simple  reproduction  is  replaced  by

reproduction  on  an  extended  scale,  by  accumulation.  In  the  former

case the capitalist squanders the whole surplus value in dissipation, in

the latter he demonstrates his bourgeois virtue by consuming only a

portion of it and converting the rest into money [.]



    Section  3.  Separation  of  Surplus  Value  into  Capital  and

Revenue. The Abstinence Theory


    In the last preceding Chapter, we treated surplus value (or the

surplus  product)  solely  as  a  fund  for  supplying  the  individual

consumption of the capitalist. In this Chapter we have, so far, treated it

solely as a fund for accumulation. It is, however, neither the one nor

the  other,  but  is  both  together.  One  portion  is  consumed  by  the

capitalist  as  revenue,  the  other  is  employed  as  capital,  is

accumulated. Given the mass of surplus value, then, the larger the

one of these parts, the smaller is the other. Caeteris paribus, the ratio

of these parts determines the magnitude of the accumulation [.]

    At the historical dawn of capitalist production, and every capitalist

upstart has personally to go through this historical stage - avarice, and

desire to get rich, are the ruling passions. But the progress of capitalist

production  not  only  creates  a  world  of  delights;  it  lays  open,  in

speculation  and  the  credit  system,  a  thousand  sources  of  sudden

enrichment. When a certain stage of development has been reached,a  conventional  degree  of  prodigality,  which  is  also  an  exhibition  of

wealth,  and  consequently  a  source  of  credit,  becomes  a  business

necessity  to  the  “unfortunate”  capitalist.  Luxury  enters  into  capital’s

expenses of representation. Moreover, the capitalist gets rich, not like

the  miser,  in  proportion  to  his  personal  labor  and  restricted

consumption,  but  at  the  same  rate  as  he  squeezes  out  the  labor

power of others, and enforces on the laborer abstinence from all life’s

enjoyments. Although, therefore, the prodigality of the capitalist never

possesses the bona fide character of the open-handed feudal lord’s

prodigality, but, on the contrary, has always lurking behind it the most

sordid avarice and the most anxious calculation, yet his expenditure

grows with his accumulation, without the one necessarily restricting

the  other.  But  along  with  this  growth,  there  is  at  the  same  time

developed in his breast, a Faustian conflict between the passion for

accumulation, and the desire for enjoyment [...]

      Accumulate,  accumulate!  That  is  Moses  and  the  prophets!

“Industry furnishes the material which saving accumulates”. Therefore,

save,  save,  i.e.,  reconvert  the  greatest  possible  portion  of  surplus

value, or surplus product into capital! Accumulation for accumulation’s

sake,  production  for  production’s  sake:  by  this  formula  classical

economy expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie, and did

not for a single instant deceive itself over the birth-throes of wealth.

But what avails lamentation in the face of historical necessity? [...]



    Section  4.  Circumstances  That,  Independently  of  The

Proportional Division of Surplus Value into Capital and Revenue,

Determine The Amount of Accumulation. Degree of Exploitation

of  Labor  Power.  Productivity  of  Labor.  Growing  Difference  in

Amount  Between  Capital  Employed  and  Capital  Consumed.

Magnitude of Capital Advanced


    [...  An]  important  factor  in  the  accumulation  of  capital  is  the

degree of productivity of social labor. With the productive power of

labor increases the mass of the products, in which a certain value,

and, therefore, a surplus value of a given magnitude, is embodied.

The rate of surplus value remaining the same or even falling, so longas it only falls more slowly, than the productive power of labor rises,

the mass of the surplus product increases. The division of this product

into  revenue  and  additional  capital  remaining  the  same,  the

consumption  of  the  capitalist  may,  therefore,  increase  without  any

decrease in the fund of accumulation. The relative magnitude of the

accumulation  fund  may  even  increase  at  the  expense  of  the

consumption fund, whilst the cheapening of commodities places at the

disposal of the capitalist as many means of enjoyment as formerly, or

even  more  than  formerly.  But  hand-in-hand  with  the  increasing

productivity of labor, goes, as we have seen, the cheapening of the

laborer, therefore a higher rate of surplus value, even when the real

wages are rising. The latter never rise proportionally to the productive

power of labor. The same value in variable capital therefore sets in

movement more labor power, and, therefore, more labor. The same

value in constant capital is embodied in more means of production,

i.e.,  in  more instruments  of  labor,  materials  of  labor  and  auxiliary

materials; it therefore also supplies more elements for the production

both  of  use  value  and  of  value,  and  with  these  more  absorbers  of

labor.  The  value  of  the  additional  capital,  therefore,  remaining  the

same or even diminishing, accelerated accumulation still takes place.

Not  only  does  the  scale  of  reproduction  materially  extend,  but  the

production of surplus value increases more rapidly than the value of

the additional capital [.]

    Labor  transmits  to  its  product  the  value  of  the  means  of

production consumed by it. On the other hand, the value and mass of

the means of production set in motion by a given quantity of labor

increase as the labor becomes more productive. Though the same

quantity of labor adds always to its products only the same sum of

new value, still the old capital value, transmitted by the labor to the

products, increases with the growing productivity of labor. An English

and a Chinese spinner, e.g., may work the same number of hours with

the same intensity; then they will both in a week create equal values.

But in spite of this equality, an immense difference will obtain between

the value of the week’s product of the Englishman, who works with a

mighty automaton, and that of the Chinaman, who has but a spinning-

wheel. In the same time as the Chinaman spins one pound of cotton,

the  Englishman  spins  several  hundreds  of  pounds.  A  sum,  manyhundred times as great, of old values swells the value of his product,

in which those re-appear in a new, useful form, and can thus function

anew as capital [...]

    With a given degree of exploitation of labor power, the mass of

the surplus value produced is determined by the number of workers

simultaneously  exploited;  and  this  corresponds,  although  in  varying

proportions, with the magnitude of the capital. The more, therefore,

capital  increases  by  means  of  successive  accumulations,  the  more

does the sum of the value increase that is divided into consumption

fund and accumulation fund. The capitalist can, therefore, live a jollier

life, and at the same time show more “abstinence”. And, finally, all the

springs  of  production  act  with  greater  elasticity,  the  more  its  scale

extends with the mass of the capital advanced.        Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation



    Section  1.  The  Increased  Demand  for  Labor  Power  That

Accompanies  Accumulation,  The  Composition  of  Capital

Remaining the Same


    In this Chapter we consider the influence of the growth of capital

on  the  lot  of  the  laboring  class.  The  most  important  factor  in  this

inquiry is the composition of capital and the changes it undergoes in

the course of the process of accumulation.

    The composition of capital is to be understood in a two-fold sense.

On the side of value, it is determined by the proportion in which it is

divided into constant capital or value of the means of production, and

variable capital or value of labor power, the sum total of wages. On

the side of material, as it functions in the process of production, all

capital is divided into means of production and living labor power. This

latter composition is determined by the relation between the mass of

the means of production employed, on the one hand, and the mass of

labor necessary for their employment on the other. I call the former the

day laborer, the latter the technical composition of capital.

    Between the two there is a strict correlation. To express this, I call

the value composition of capital, in so far as it is determined by its

technical  composition  and  mirrors  the  changes  of  the  latter,  the

organic composition of capital. Wherever I refer to the composition of

capital, without further qualification, its organic composition is always

understood.

    The  many  individual  capitals  invested  in  a  particular  branch  of

production  have,  one  with  another,  more  or  less  different

compositions. The average of their individual compositions gives us

the composition of the total capital in this branch of production. Lastly,

the average of these averages, in all branches of production, gives us

the composition of the total social capital of a country, and with thisalone  are  we,  in  the  last  resort,  concerned  in  the  following

investigation [...]

    As simple reproduction constantly reproduces the capital relation

itself,  i.e.,  the  relation  of  capitalists  on  the  one  hand,  and  wage

workers  on  the  other,  so  reproduction  on  a  progressive  scale,  i.e.,

accumulation, reproduces the capital relation on a progressive scale,

more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole, more wage workers at

that.  The  reproduction  of  a  mass  of  labor  power,  which  must

incessantly  re-incorporate  itself  with  capital  for  that  capital´s  self-

expansion;  which  cannot  get  free  from  capital,  and  whose

enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety of individual

capitalists  to  whom  it  sells  itself,  this  reproduction  of  labor  power

forms,  in  fact,  an  essential  of  the  reproduction  of  capital  itself.

Accumulation of capital is, therefore, increase of the proletariat [...]

    In the controversies on this subject the chief fact has generally

been  overlooked,  viz.,  the differentia  specifica  of  capitalistic

production. Labor power is sold today, not with a view of satisfying, by

its service or by its product, the personal needs of the buyer. His aim

is augmentation of his capital, production of commodities containing

more labor than he pays for, containing therefore a portion of value

that  costs  him  nothing,  and  that  is  nevertheless  realized  when  the

commodities are sold. Production of surplus value is the absolute law

of this mode of production. Labor power is only saleable so far as it

preserves  the  means  of  production  in  their  capacity  of  capital,

reproduces  its  own  value  as  capital,  and  yields  in  unpaid  labor  a

source of additional capital [.]

    Wages, as we have seen, by their very nature, always imply the

performance of a certain quantity of unpaid labor on the part of the

laborer. Altogether, irrespective of the case of a rise of wages with a

falling  price  of  labor,  etc.,  such  an  increase  only  means  at  best  a

quantitative  diminution  of  the  unpaid  labor  that  the  worker  has  to

supply. This diminution can never reach the point at which it would

threaten the system itself. Apart from violent conflicts as to the rate of

wages (and Adam Smith has already shown that in such a conflict,

taken on the whole, the master is always master), a rise in the price of

labor  resulting  from  accumulation  of  capital  implies  the  following

alternative:    Either the price of labor keeps on rising, because its rise does not

interfere  with  the  progress  of  accumulation.  In  this  there  is  nothing

wonderful, for, says Adam Smith, “after these (profits) are diminished,

stock may not only continue to increase, but to increase much faster

than before.

    A great stock, though with small profits, generally increases faster

than a small stock with great profits”. [...] In this case it is evident that

a diminution in the unpaid labor in no way interferes with the extension

of  the  domain  of  capital.  —  Or,  on  the  other  hand,  accumulation

slackens in consequence of the rise in the price of labor, because the

stimulus of gain is blunted. The rate of accumulation lessens; but with

its lessening, the primary cause of that lessening vanishes, i.e., the

disproportion  between  capital  and  exploitable  labor  power.  The

mechanism of the process of capitalist production removes the very

obstacles that it temporarily creates. The price of labor falls again to a

level corresponding with the needs of the self-expansion of capital,

whether the level be below, the same as, or above the one which was

normal before the rise of wages took place. We see thus: In the first

case,  it  is  not  the  diminished  rate  either  of  the  absolute,  or  of  the

proportional,  increase  in  labor  power,  or  laboring  population,  which

causes capital to be in excess, but conversely the excess of capital

that makes exploitable labor power insufficient. In the second case, it

is not the increased rate either of the absolute, or of the proportional,

increase  in  labor  power,  or  laboring  population,  that  makes  capital

insufficient;  but,  conversely,  the  relative  diminution  of  capital  that

causes the exploitable labor power, or rather its price, to be in excess.

It is these absolute movements of the accumulation of capital which

are reflected as relative movements of the mass of exploitable labor

power, and therefore seem produced by the latter’s own independent

movement. To put it mathematically: the rate of accumulation is the

independent,  not  the  dependent,  variable;  the  rate  of  wages,  the

dependent, not the independent, variable [.]

    The  law  of  capitalist  production,  that  is  at  the  bottom  of  the

pretended “natural law of population”, reduces itself simply to this: The

correlation  between  accumulation  of  capital  and  rate  of  wages  is

nothing  else  than  the  correlation  between  the  unpaid  labor

transformed into capital, and the additional paid labor necessary forthe setting in motion of this additional capital. It is therefore in no way

a relation between two magnitudes, independent one of the other: on

the one hand, the magnitude of the capital; on the other, the number

of  the  laboring  population;  it  is  rather,  at  bottom,  only  the  relation

between  the  unpaid  and  the  paid  labor  of  the  same  laboring

population.  If  the  quantity  of  unpaid  labor  supplied  by  the  working

class, and accumulated by the capitalist class, increases so rapidly

that its conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of

paid labor, then wages rise, and, all other circumstances remaining

equal, the unpaid labor diminishes in proportion. But as soon as this

diminution touches the point at which the surplus labor that nourishes

capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity, a reaction sets in: a

smaller  part  of  revenue  is  capitalized,  accumulation  lags,  and  the

movement of rise in wages receives a check.

    The rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only

leave intact the foundations of the capitalistic system, but also secure

its  reproduction  on  a  progressive  scale.  The  law  of  capitalistic

accumulation, metamorphosed by economists into pretended law of

Nature, in reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation

excludes every diminution in the degree of exploitation of labor, and

every  rise  in  the  price  of  labor,  which  could  seriously  imperil  the

continual reproduction, on an ever-enlarging scale, of the capitalistic

relation. It cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the

laborer exists to satisfy the needs of self-expansion of existing values,

instead  of,  on  the  contrary,  material  wealth  existing  to  satisfy  the

needs of development on the part of the laborer. As, in religion, man is

governed  by  the  products  of  his  own  brain,  so  in  capitalistic

production, he is governed by the products of his own hand [...]



    Section 2. Relative Diminution of the Variable Part of Capital

Simultaneously with The Progress of Accumulation and of The

Concentration That Accompanies It


    [...]  On  the  basis  of  the  production  of  commodities,  where  the

means of production are the property of private persons, and where

the artisan therefore either produces commodities, isolated from andindependent  of  others,  or  sells  his  labor  power  as  a  commodity,

because he lacks the means for independent industry, co-operation on

a  large  scale  can  realize  itself  only  in  the  increase  of  individual

capitals, only in proportion as the means of social production and the

means  of  subsistence  are  transformed  into  the  private  property  of

capitalists. The basis of the production of commodities can admit of

production on a large scale in the capitalistic form alone. A certain

accumulation  of  capital,  in  the  hands  of  individual  producers  of

commodities,  forms  therefore  the  necessary  preliminary  of  the

specifically  capitalistic  mode  of  production.  We  had,  therefore,  to

assume  that  this  occurs  during  the  transition  from  handicraft  to

capitalistic industry. It may be called primitive accumulation, because

it  is  the  historic  basis,  instead  of  the  historic  result  of  specifically

capitalist production. How it itself originates, we need not here inquire

as yet. It is enough that it forms the starting point. But all methods for

raising the social productive power of labor that are developed on this

basis, are at the same time methods for the increased production of

surplus  value  or  surplus  product,  which  in  its  turn  is  the  formative

element of accumulation.

    They are, therefore, at the same time methods of the production

of capital by capital, or methods of its accelerated accumulation. The

continual re-transformation of surplus value into capital now appears

in the shape of the increasing magnitude of the capital that enters into

the process of production. This in turn is the basis of an extended

scale of production, of the methods for raising the productive power of

labor  that  accompany  it,  and  of  accelerated  production  of  surplus

value.  If,  therefore,  a  certain  degree  of  accumulation  of  capital

appears  as  a  condition  of  the  specifically  capitalist  mode  of

production, the latter causes conversely an accelerated accumulation

of capital. With the accumulation of capital, therefore, the specifically

capitalistic mode of production develops, and with the capitalist mode

of production the accumulation of capital. Both these economic factors

bring about, in the compound ratio of the impulses they reciprocally

give one another, that change in the technical composition of capital

by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller and smaller

as compared with the constant.    Every  individual  capital  is  a  larger  or  smaller  concentration  of

means of production, with a corresponding command over a larger or

smaller labor-army. Every accumulation becomes the means of new

accumulation. With the increasing mass of wealth which functions as

capital, accumulation increases the concentration of that wealth in the

hands  of  individual  capitalists,  and  thereby  widens  the  basis  of

production on a large scale and of the specific methods of capitalist

production. The growth of social capital is effected by the growth of

many individual capitals. All other circumstances remaining the same,

individual capitals, and with them the concentration of the means of

production, increase in such proportion as they form aliquot parts of

the  total  social  capital.  At  the  same  time  portions  of  the  original

capitals  disengage  themselves  and  function  as  new  independent

capitals.  Besides  other  causes,  the  division  of  property,  within

capitalist families, plays a great part in this. With the accumulation of

capital, therefore, the number of capitalists grows to a greater or less

extent. Two points characterize this kind of concentration which grows

directly out of, or rather is identical with, accumulation.

    First:  The  increasing  concentration  of  the  social  means  of

production  in  the  hands  of  individual  capitalists  is,  other  things

remaining equal, limited by the degree of increase of social wealth.

Second: The part of social capital domiciled in each particular sphere

of production is divided among many capitalists who face one another

as  independent  commodity  producers  competing  with  each  other.

Accumulation and the concentration accompanying it are, therefore,

not  only  scattered  over  many  points,  but  the  increase  of  each

functioning capital is thwarted by the formation of new and the sub-

division of old capitals. Accumulation, therefore, presents itself on the

one hand as increasing concentration of the means of production, and

of  the  command  over  labor;  on  the  other,  as  repulsion  of  many

individual capitals one from another.

    This  splitting-up  of  the  total  social  capital  into  many  individual

capitals  or  the  repulsion  of  its  fractions  one  from  another,  is

counteracted by their attraction. This last does not mean that simple

concentration of the means of production and of the command over

labor,  which  is  identical  with  accumulation.  It  is  concentration  of

capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence,expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small

into few large capitals. This process differs from the former in this, that

it only presupposes a change in the distribution of capital already to

hand, and functioning; its field of action is therefore not limited by the

absolute  growth  of  social  wealth,  by  the  absolute  limits  of

accumulation. Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single

hand,  because  it  has  in  another  place  been  lost  by  many.  This  is

centralization proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration.

    The laws of this centralization of capitals, or of the attraction of

capital by capital, cannot be developed here. A brief hint at a few facts

must  suffice.  The  battle  of  competition  is  fought  by  cheapening  of

commodities.  The  cheapness  of  commodities  demands, caeteris

paribus, on the productiveness of labor, and this again on the scale of

production.  Therefore,  the  larger  capitals  beat  the  smaller.  It  will

further  be  remembered  that,  with  the  development  of  the  capitalist

mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of

individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal

conditions [...]

      Commensurately  with  the  development  of  capitalist  production

and  accumulation  there  develop  the  two  most  powerful  levers  of

centralization — competition and credit [.]



    Section  3.  Progressive  Production  of  a  Relative  Surplus

Population or Industrial Reserve Army


    The  accumulation  of  capital,  though  originally  appearing  as  its

quantitative  extension  only,  is  effected,  as  we  have  seen,  under  a

progressive  qualitative  change  in  its  composition,  under  a  constant

increase of its constant, at the expense of its variable constituent.

    The specifically capitalist mode of production, the development of

the  productive  power  of  labor  corresponding  to  it,  and  the  change

thence resulting in the organic composition of capital, do not merely

keep pace with the advance of accumulation, or with the growth of

social wealth. They develop at a much quicker rate, because mere

accumulation,  the  absolute  increase  of  the  total  social  capital,  is

accompanied by the centralization of the individual capitals of whichthat total is made up; and because the change in the technological

composition of the additional capital goes hand in hand with a similar

change in the technological composition of the original capital [...] With

the  growth  of  the  total  capital,  its  variable  constituent  or  the  labor

incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a constantly diminishing

proportion  [...]  This  accelerated  relative  diminution  of  the  variable

constituent, that goes along with the accelerated increase of the total

capital, and moves more rapidly than this increase, takes the inverse

form,  at  the  other  pole,  of  an  apparently  absolute  increase  of  the

laboring population, an increase always moving more rapidly than that

of the variable capital or the means of employment. But in fact, it is

capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces, and produces

in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant

population of laborers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices

for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore a

surplus population [...]

    The  laboring  population  therefore  produces,  along  with  the

accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which it itself is

made  relatively  superfluous,  is  turned  into  a  relative  surplus

population; and it does this to an always increasing extent. This is a

law of population peculiar to the capitalist mode of production [...] But

if a surplus laboring population is a necessary product of accumulation

or  of  the  development  of  wealth  on  a  capitalist  basis,  this  surplus

population becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalistic accumulation,

nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production. It

forms  a  disposable  industrial  reserve  army,  that  belongs  to  capital

quite  as  absolutely  as  if  the  latter  had  bred  it  at  its  own  cost.

Independently  of  the  limits  of  the  actual  increase  of  population,  it

creates,  for  the  changing  needs  of  the  self-expansion  of  capital,  a

mass of human material always ready for exploitation [.]

    The  course  characteristic  of  modern  industry,  viz.,  a  decennial

cycle  (interrupted  by  smaller  oscillations),  of  periods  of  average

activity, production at high pressure, crisis and stagnation, depends on

the  constant  formation,  the  greater  or  less  absorption,  and  the  re-

formation of the industrial reserve army or surplus population. In their

turn,  the  varying  phases  of  the  industrial  cycle  recruit  the  surplus

population,  and  become  one  of  the  most  energetic  agents  of  itsreproduction. This peculiar course of modern industry, which occurs in

no  earlier  period  of  human  history,  was  also  impossible  in  the

childhood of capitalist production. The composition of capital changed

but very slowly. With its accumulation, therefore, there kept pace, on

the whole, a corresponding growth in the demand for labor. Slow as

was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more modern

times, it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable laboring

population, limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means to

be mentioned later [...] The whole form of the movement of modern

industry  depends,  therefore,  upon  the  constant  transformation  of  a

part  of  the  laboring  population  into  unemployed  or  half-employed

hands.

    Capitalist  production  can  by  no  means  content  itself  with  the

quantity  of  disposable  labor  power  which  the  natural  increase  of

population yields. It requires for its free play an industrial reserve army

independent of these natural limits [...]

    The number of laborers commanded by capital may remain the

same, or even fall, while the variable capital increases. This is the

case  if  the  individual  laborer  yields  more  labor,  and  therefore  his

wages increase, and this although the price of labor remains the same

or even falls, only more slowly than the mass of labor rises. Increase

of variable capital, in this case, becomes an index of more labor, but

not  of  more  laborers  employed.  It  is  the  absolute  interest  of  every

capitalist to press a given quantity of labor out of a smaller, rather than

a greater number of laborers, if the cost is about the same. In the

latter case, the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the

mass  of  labor  set  in  action;  in  the  former  that  increase  is  much

smaller. The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this

motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital [.]

    If  the  means  of  production,  as  they  increase  in  extent  and

effective  power,  become  to  a  less  extent  means  of  employment  of

laborers,  this  state  of  things  is  again  modified  by  the  fact  that  in

proportion as the productiveness of labor increases, capital increases

its  supply  of  labor  more  quickly  than  its  demand  for  laborers.  The

overwork of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of

the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its

competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to overworkand to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of

one part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of

the other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the

individual capitalists, and accelerates at the same time the production

of  the  industrial  reserve  army  on  a  scale  corresponding  with  the

advance of social accumulation [...]                  PART 8: THE SO-CALLED PRIMITIVE

                                ACCUMULATION              Chapter 26: The Secret of Primitive Accumulation



    We have seen how money is changed into capital; how through

capital surplus value is made, and from surplus value more capital.

But  the  accumulation  of  capital  presupposes  surplus  value;  surplus

value  presupposes  capitalistic  production;  capitalistic  production

presupposes the pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and

of labor power in the hands of producers of commodities. The whole

movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we

can  only  get  by  supposing  a  primitive  accumulation  (previous

accumulation of Adam Smith) preceding capitalistic accumulation; an

accumulation not the result of the capitalistic mode of production, but

its starting point [...]

    In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than

are  the  means  of  production  and  of  subsistence.  They  want

transforming into capital. But this transformation itself can only take

place  under  certain  circumstances  that  center  in  this,  viz.,  that  two

very different kinds of commodity possessors must come face to face

and into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of

production, means of subsistence, who are eager to increase the sum

of values they possess, by buying other people’s labor power; on the

other hand, free laborers, the sellers of their own labor power, and

therefore the sellers of labor. Free laborers, in the double sense that

neither  they  themselves  form  part  and  parcel  of  the  means  of

production,  as  in  the  case  of  slaves,  bondsmen,  etc.,  nor  do  the

means  of  production  belong  to  them,  as  in  the  case  of  peasant-

proprietors;  they  are,  therefore,  free  from,  unencumbered  by,  any

means of production of their own.

    With  this  polarization  of  the  market  for  commodities,  the

fundamental  conditions  of  capitalist  production  are  given.  The

capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the laborers

from all property in the means by which they can realize their labor. As

soon  as  capitalist  production  is  once  on  its  own  legs,  it  not  only

maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending

scale.  The  process,  therefore,  that  clears  the  way  for  the  capitalistsystem, can be none other than the process which takes away from

the laborer the possession of his means of production; a process that

transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of

production  into  capital,  on  the  other,  the  immediate  producers  into

wage  laborers.  The  so-called  primitive  accumulation,  therefore,  is

nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from

the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the

prehistoric  stage  of  capital  and  of  the  mode  of  production

corresponding with it.

    The economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the

economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the latter set

free the elements of the former.

    The immediate producer, the laborer, could only dispose of his

own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased

to be the slave, serf, or bondsman of another. To become a free seller

of  labor  power,  who  carries  his  commodity  wherever  he  finds  a

market, he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds,

their rules for apprentices and journeymen, and the impediments of

their labor regulations. Hence, the historical movement which changes

the producers into wage workers, appears, on the one hand, as their

emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this

side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the other hand,

these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had

been  robbed  of  all  their  own  means  of  production,  and  of  all  the

guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And

the  history  of  this,  their  expropriation,  is  written  in  the  annals  of

mankind in letters of blood and fire.

    The industrial capitalists, these new potentates, had on their part

not  only  to  displace  the  guild  masters  of  handicrafts,  but  also  the

feudal lords, the possessors of the sources of wealth. In this respect,

their  conquest  of  social  power  appears  as  the  fruit  of  a  victorious

struggle  both  against  feudal  lordship  and  its  revolting  prerogatives,

and  against  the  guilds  and  the  fetters  they  laid  on  the  free

development of production and the free exploitation of man by man.

The chevaliers d’industrie,  however,  only  succeeded  in  supplanting

the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they

themselves were wholly innocent. They have risen by means as vileas those by which the Roman freedman once on a time made himself

the master of his patronus.

    The starting point of the development that gave rise to the wage

laborer as well as to the capitalist, was the servitude of the laborer.

The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in the

transformation  of  feudal  exploitation  into  capitalist  exploitation.  To

understand  its  march,  we  need  not  go  back  very  far.  Although  we

come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as

the  14th  or  15th  century,  sporadically,  in  certain  towns  of  the

Mediterranean,  the  capitalistic  era  dates  from  the  16th  century.

Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been long effected,

and  the  highest  development  of  the  Middle  Ages,  the  existence  of

sovereign towns, has been long on the wane.

    In the history of primitive accumulation, all revolutions are epoch-

making that act as levers for the capital class in course of formation;

but,  above  all,  those  moments  when  great  masses  of  men  are

suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence, and hurled

as  free  and  “unattached”  proletarians  on  the  labor  market.  The

expropriation of the agricultural producer, of the peasant, from the soil,

is the basis of the whole process. The history of this expropriation, in

different  countries,  assumes  different  aspects,  and  runs  through  its

various  phases  in  different  orders  of  succession,  and  at  different

periods. In England alone, which we take as our example, has it the

classic form.        Chapter 27: Expropriation of The Agricultural Population

                                  from The Land



    In England, serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of

the 14th century. The immense majority of the population consisted

then, and to a still larger extent, in the 15th century, of free peasant

proprietors,  whatever  was  the  feudal  title  under  which  their  right  of

property was hidden. In the larger seigniorial domains, the old bailiff,

himself a serf, was displaced by the free farmer. The wage laborers of

agriculture consisted partly of peasants, who utilized their leisure time

by working on the large estates, partly of an independent special class

of wage laborers, relatively and absolutely few in numbers. The latter

also were practically at the same time peasant farmers, since, besides

their wages, they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of 4 or

more acres, together with their cottages. Besides they, with the rest of

the peasants, enjoyed the usufruct of the common land, which gave

pasture to their cattle, furnished them with timber, fire-wood, turf, etc.

In  all  countries  of  Europe,  feudal  production  is  characterized  by

division  of  the  soil  amongst  the  greatest  possible  number  of  sub

feudatories. The might of the feudal lord, like that of the sovereign,

depended not on the length of his rent roll, but on the number of his

subjects,  and  the  latter  depended  on  the  number  of  peasant

proprietors.  Although,  therefore,  the  English  land,  after  the  Norman

Conquest,  was  distributed  in  gigantic  baronies,  one  of  which  often

included some 900 of the old Anglo-Saxon lordships, it was bestrewn

with small peasant properties, only here and there interspersed with

great  seigniorial  domains.  Such  conditions,  together  with  the

prosperity of the towns so characteristic of the 15th century, allowed of

that wealth of the people which Chancellor Fortescue so eloquently

paints in his “Laudibus legum Angliae”; but it excluded the possibility

of capitalistic wealth.

    The  prelude  of  the  revolution  that  laid  the  foundation  of  the

capitalist mode of production, was played in the last third of the 15th,and the first decade of the 16th century. A mass of free proletarians

was hurled on the labor market by the breaking-up of the bands of

feudal retainers, who, as Sir James Steuart well says, “everywhere

uselessly filled house and castle”. Although the royal power, itself a

product  of  bourgeois  development,  in  its  strife  after  absolute

sovereignty  forcibly  hastened  on  the  dissolution  of  these  bands  of

retainers, it was by no means the sole cause of it. In insolent conflict

with  king  and  parliament,  the  great  feudal  lords  created  an

incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry

from the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord

himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands. The rapid rise of

the  Flemish  wool  manufactures,  and  the  corresponding  rise  in  the

price of wool in England, gave the direct impulse to these evictions.

The old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars. The new

nobility was the child of its time, for which money was the power of all

powers.  Transformation  of  arable  land  into  sheep-walks  was,

therefore,  its  cry  [...]  In  his  history  of  Henry  VII,  Bacon  says:

“Enclosures at that time (1489) began to be more frequent, whereby

arable land (which could not be manured without people and families)

was turned into pasture, which was easily rid by a few herdsmen; and

tenancies  for  years,  lives,  and  at  will  (whereupon  much  of  the

yeomanry lived) were turned into demesnes” [...]

    The process of forcible expropriation of the people received in the

16th century a new and frightful impulse from the Reformation, and

from the consequent colossal spoliation of the church property. The

Catholic church was, at the time of the Reformation, feudal proprietor

of  a  great  part  of  the  English  land.  The  suppression  of  the

monasteries, etc., hurled their inmates into the proletariat. The estates

of the church were to a large extent given away to rapacious royal

favorites,  or  sold  at  a  nominal  price  to  speculating  farmers  and

citizens,  who  drove  out,  en  masse,  the  hereditary  sub-tenants  and

threw their holdings into one. The legally guaranteed property of the

poorer folk in a part of the church’s tithes was tacitly confiscated [...]

    Even in the last decade of the 17th century, the yeomanry, the

class of independent peasants, were more numerous than the class of

farmers. They had formed the backbone of Cromwell’s strength, and,

even  according  to  the  confession  of  Macaulay,  stood  in  favorablecontrast  to  the  drunken  squires  and  to  their  servants,  the  country

clergy,  who  had  to  marry  their  masters’  cast-off  mistresses.  About

1750, the yeomanry had disappeared, and so had, in the last decade

of  the  18th  century,  the  last  trace  of  the  common  land  of  the

agricultural laborer. We leave on one side here the purely economic

causes of the agricultural revolution. We deal only with the forcible

means employed [...]

    The “Glorious Revolution” brought into power, along with William

of Orange, the landlord and capitalist appropriators of surplus value.

They inaugurated the new era by practicing on a colossal scale thefts

of state lands, thefts that had been hitherto managed more modestly.

These estates were given away, sold at a ridiculous figure, or even

annexed to private estates by direct seizure. All this happened without

the  slightest  observation  of  legal  etiquette.  The  Crown  lands  thus

fraudulently  appropriated,  together  with  the  robbery  of  the  Church

estates, as far as these had not been lost again during the republican

revolution, form the basis of the today princely domains of the English

oligarchy.  The  bourgeois  capitalists  favored  the  operation  with  the

view, among others, to promoting free trade in land, to extending the

domain  of  modern  agriculture  on  the  large  farm-system,  and  to

increasing  their  supply  of  the  free  agricultural  proletarians  ready  to

hand. Besides, the new landed aristocracy was the natural ally of the

new bankocracy, of the newly-hatched haute finance, and of the large

manufacturers, then depending on protective duties.

    Communal property - always distinct from the State property just

dealt with - was an old Teutonic institution which lived on under cover

of  feudalism.  We  have  seen  how  the  forcible  usurpation  of  this,

generally  accompanied  by  the  turning  of  arable  into  pasture  land,

begins at the end of the 15th and extends into the 16th century. But, at

that time, the process was carried on by means of individual acts of

violence against which legislation, for a hundred and fifty years, fought

in vain. The advance made by the 18th century shows itself in this,

that  the  law  itself  becomes  now  the  instrument  of  the  theft  of  the

people’s  land,  although  the  large  farmers  make  use  of  their  little

independent methods as well. The parliamentary form of the robbery

is that of Acts for enclosures of Commons, in other words, decrees bywhich  the  landlords  grant  themselves  the  people’s  land  as  private

property, decrees of expropriation of the people [...]

    In the 19th century, the very memory of the connection between

the  agricultural  laborer  and  the  communal  property  had,  of  course,

vanished [...]

    The spoliation of the church’s property, the fraudulent alienation of

the State domains, the robbery of the common lands, the usurpation

of feudal and clan property, and its transformation into modern private

property under circumstances of reckless terrorism, were just so many

idyllic methods of primitive accumulation. They conquered the field for

capitalistic agriculture, made the soil part and parcel of capital, and

created for the town industries the necessary supply of a “free” and

outlawed proletariat [...]              Chapter 28: Genesis of The Industrial Capitalist



    The genesis of the industrial capitalist did not proceed in such a

gradual  way  as  that  of  the  farmer.  Doubtless  many  small  guild-

masters,  and  yet  more  independent  small  artisans,  or  even  wage

laborers,  transformed  themselves  into  small  capitalists,  and  (by

gradually  extending  exploitation  of  wage  labor  and  corresponding

accumulation)  into  full-blown  capitalists.  In  the  infancy  of  capitalist

production, things often happened as in the infancy of medieval towns,

where the question, which of the escaped serfs should be master and

which servant, was in great part decided by the earlier or later date of

their flight. The snail’s pace of this method corresponded in no wise

with the commercial requirements of the new world market that the

great  discoveries  of  the  end  of  the  15th  century  created.  But  the

Middle  Ages  had  handed  down  two  distinct  forms  of  capital,  which

mature in the most different economic social formations, and which

before the era of the capitalist mode of production, are considered as

capital quand même — usurer’s capital and merchant’s capital [...]

    The money capital formed by means of usury and commerce was

prevented  from  turning  into  industrial  capital,  in  the  country  by  the

feudal  constitution,  in  the  towns  by  the  guild  organization.  These

fetters  vanished  with  the  dissolution  of  feudal  society,  with  the

expropriation and partial eviction of the country population. The new

manufactures  were  established  at  sea-ports,  or  at  inland  points

beyond the control of the old municipalities and their guilds. Hence in

England an embittered struggle of the corporate towns against these

new industrial nurseries.

    The  discovery  of  gold  and  silver  in  America,  the  extirpation,

enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population,

the  beginning  of  the  conquest  and  looting  of  the  East  Indies,  the

turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-

skins,  signalized  the  rosy  dawn  of  the  era  of  capitalist  production.

These  idyllic  proceedings  are  the  chief  momenta  of  primitiveaccumulation.  On  their  heels  treads  the  commercial  war  of  the

European nations, with the globe for a theatre [...]

    The  different  momenta  of  primitive  accumulation  distribute

themselves now, more or less in chronological order, particularly over

Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and England. In England at the end

of  the  17th  century,  they  arrive  at  a  systematical  combination,

embracing  the  colonies,  the  national  debt,  the  modern  mode  of

taxation, and the protectionist system. These methods depend in part

on  brute  force,  e.g.,  the  colonial  system.  But,  they  all  employ  the

power of the State, the concentrated and organized force of society, to

hasten, hot-house fashion, the process of transformation of the feudal

mode  of  production  into  the  capitalist  mode,  and  to  shorten  the

transition. Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a

new one. It is itself an economic power [...]

    The  colonial  system  ripened,  like  a  hot-house,  trade  and

navigation. The “societies Monopolia” of Luther were powerful levers

for  concentration  of  capital.  The  colonies  secured  a  market  for  the

budding manufactures, and, through the monopoly of the market, an

increased  accumulation.  The  treasures  captured  outside  Europe  by

undisguised  looting,  enslavement,  and  murder,  floated  back  to  the

mother-country and were there turned into capital. Holland, which first

fully developed the colonial system, in 1648 stood already in the acme

of its commercial greatness [...] Today industrial supremacy implies

commercial  supremacy.  In  the  period  of  manufacture  properly  so

called, it is, on the other hand, the commercial supremacy that gives

industrial predominance. Hence the preponderant role that the colonial

system plays at that time [...]

    The system of public credit, i.e., of national debts, whose origin

we discover in Genoa and Venice as early as the Middle Ages, took

possession of Europe generally during the manufacturing period. The

colonial system with its maritime trade and commercial wars served as

a forcing-house for it. Thus it first took root in Holland. National debts,

i.e., the alienation of the state — whether despotic, constitutional or

republican — marked with its stamp the capitalistic era [...]

    The  public  debt  becomes  one  of  the  most  powerful  levers  of

primitive accumulation. As with the stroke of an enchanter’s wand, it

endows barren money with the power of breeding and thus turns it intocapital, without the necessity of its exposing itself to the troubles and

risks inseparable from its employment in industry or even in usury.

The  state  creditors  actually  give  nothing  away,  for  the  sum  lent  is

transformed  into  public  bonds,  easily  negotiable,  which  go  on

functioning  in  their  hands  just  as  so  much  hard  cash  would.  But

further, apart from the class of lazy annuitants thus created, and from

the  improvised  wealth  of  the  financiers,  middlemen  between  the

government and the nation [,] the national debt has given rise to joint-

stock companies, to dealings in negotiable effects of all kinds, and to

agiotage,  in  a  word  to  stock-exchange  gambling  and  the  modern

bankocracy.  At  their  birth  the  great  banks,  decorated  with  national

titles,  were  only  associations  of  private  speculators,  who  placed

themselves by the side of governments, and, thanks to the privileges

they  received,  were  in  a  position  to  advance  money  to  the  State.

Hence the accumulation of the national debt has no more infallible

measure than the successive rise in the stock of these banks [...]

    With the national debt arose an international credit system, which

often conceals one of the sources of primitive accumulation in this or

that people. Thus the villainies of the Venetian thieving system formed

one  of  the  secret  bases  of  the  capital-wealth  of  Holland  to  whom

Venice in her decadence lent large sums of money. So also was it

with Holland and England. By the beginning of the 18th century the

Dutch manufactures were far outstripped. Holland had ceased to be

the nation preponderant in commerce and industry. One of its main

lines  of  business,  therefore,  from  1701-1776,  is  the  lending  out  of

enormous amounts of capital, especially to its great rival England. The

same thing is going on today between England and the United States.

A  great  deal  of  capital,  which  appears  today  in  the  United  States

without  any  certificate  of  birth,  was  yesterday,  in  England,  the

capitalized blood of children.

    As the national debt finds its support in the public revenue, which

must cover the yearly payments for interest, etc., the modern system

of taxation was the necessary complement of the system of national

loans.  The  loans  enable  the  government  to  meet  extraordinary

expenses,  without  the  tax-payers  feeling  it  immediately,  but  they

necessitate, as a consequence, increased taxes. On the other hand,

the raising of taxation caused by the accumulation of debts contractedone after another, compels the government always to have recourse

to new loans for new extraordinary expenses.

    Modern  fiscality,  whose  pivot  is  formed  by  taxes  on  the  most

necessary means of subsistence (thereby increasing their price), thus

contains within itself the germ of automatic progression. Over taxation

is not an incident, but rather a principle [...]

    Colonial  system,  public  debts,  heavy  taxes,  protection,

commercial wars, etc., these children of the true manufacturing period,

increase gigantically during the infancy of modern industry [...]      Chapter 29: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation



    What does the primitive accumulation of capital, i.e., its historical

genesis,  resolve  itself  into?  In  so  far  as  it  is  not  immediate

transformation of slaves and serfs into wage laborers, and therefore a

mere change of form, it only means the expropriation of the immediate

producers, i.e., the dissolution of private property based on the labor

of  its  owner.  Private  property,  as  the  antithesis  to  social,  collective

property,  exists  only  where  the  means  of  labor  and  the  external

conditions  of  labor  belong  to  private  individuals.  But  according  as

these private individuals are laborers or not laborers, private property

has a different character. The numberless shades, that it at first sight

presents, correspond to the intermediate stages lying between these

two  extremes.  The  private  property  of  the  laborer  in  his  means  of

production  is  the  foundation  of  petty  industry,  whether  agricultural,

manufacturing, or both; petty industry, again, is an essential condition

for the development of social production and of the free individuality of

the laborer himself. Of course, this petty mode of production exists

also under slavery, serfdom, and other states of dependence. But it

flourishes,  it  lets  loose  its  whole  energy,  it  attains  its  adequate

classical form, only where the laborer is the private owner of his own

means of labor set in action by himself: the peasant of the land which

he cultivates, the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso.

    This mode of production presupposes parceling of the soil and

scattering  of  the  other  means  of  production.  As  it  excludes  the

concentration of these means of production, so also it excludes co-

operation,  division  of  labor  within  each  separate  process  of

production,  the  control  over,  and  the  productive  application  of  the

forces of Nature by society, and the free development of the social

productive powers. It is compatible only with a system of production,

and  a  society,  moving  within  narrow  and  more  or  less  primitive

bounds.  To  perpetuate  it  would  be,  as  Pecqueur  rightly  says,  “to

decree  universal  mediocrity".  At  a  certain  stage  of  development,  itbrings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution. From that

moment  new  forces  and  new  passions  spring  up  in  the  bosom  of

society; but the old social organization fetters them and keeps them

down.  It  must  be  annihilated;  it  is  annihilated.  Its  annihilation,  the

transformation of the individualized and scattered means of production

into socially concentrated ones, of the pigmy property of the many into

the huge property of the few, the expropriation of the great mass of

the people from the soil, from the means of subsistence, and from the

means of labor, this fearful and painful expropriation of the mass of

the people forms the prelude to the history of capital. It comprises a

series of forcible methods, of which we have passed in review only

those  that  have  been  epoch-making  as  methods  of  the  primitive

accumulation of capital. The expropriation of the immediate producers

was accomplished with merciless Vandalism, and under the stimulus

of passions the most infamous, the most sordid, the pettiest, the most

meanly odious. Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say,

on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring individual

with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private

property,  which  rests  on  exploitation  of  the  nominally  free  labor  of

others, i.e., on wage labor.

    As  soon  as  this  process  of  transformation  has  sufficiently

decomposed  the  old  society  from  top  to  bottom,  as  soon  as  the

laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital,

as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet,

then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the

land  and  other  means  of  production  into  socially  exploited  and,

therefore,  common  means  of  production,  as  well  as  the  further

expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is

now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself,

but  the  capitalist  exploiting  many  laborers.  This  expropriation  is

accomplished  by  the  action  of  the  immanent  laws  of  capitalistic

production itself, by the centralization of capital. One capitalist always

kills many. Hand in hand with this centralization, or this expropriation

of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever-extending scale, the

co-operative  form  of  the  labor  process,  the  conscious  technical

application  of  science,  the  methodical  cultivation  of  the  soil,  the

transformation  of  the instruments  of  labor  into instruments  of  laboronly usable in common, the economizing of all means of production by

their use as means of production of combined, socialized labor, the

entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world market, and with

this, the international character of the capitalistic regime.

    Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of

capital, who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of

transformation,  grows  the  mass  of  misery,  oppression,  slavery,

degradation,  exploitation;  but  with  this  too  grows  the  revolt  of  the

working class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined,

united, organized by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist

production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the

mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with,

and  under  it.  Centralization  of  the  means  of  production  and

socialization  of  labor  at  last  reach  a  point  where  they  become

incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst

asunder.  The  knell  of  capitalist  private  property  sounds.  The

expropriators are expropriated.

    The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist

mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the

first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of

the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of

a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This

does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him

individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e.,

on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the

means of production.

    The  transformation  of  scattered  private  property,  arising  from

individual labor, into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process,

incomparably  more  protracted,  violent,  and  difficult,  than  the

transformation  of  capitalistic  private  property,  already  practically

resting on socialized production, into socialized property. In the former

case, we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few

usurpers; in the latter, we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by

the mass of the people [...]    BOOK 2: THE PROCESS OF CIRCULATION

                                OF CAPITAL      PART 1: THE METAMORPHOSES OF CAPITAL AND

                                THEIR CIRCUITS                    Chapter 1: The Circuit of Money Capital



    The  circular  movement  of  capital  takes  place  in  three  stages,

which,  according  to  the  presentation  in  Book  I,  form  the  following

series:

    First stage: The capitalist appears as a buyer on the commodity-

and the labor market; his money is transformed into commodities, or it

goes through the circulation act M — C.

    Second  Stage:  Productive  consumption  of  the  purchased

commodities  by  the  capitalist.  He  acts  as  a  capitalist  producer  of

commodities;  his  capital  passes  through  the  process  of  production.

The result is a commodity of more value than that of the elements

entering into its production.

    Third Stage: The capitalist returns to the market as a seller; his

commodities  are  turned  into  money;  or  they  pass  through  the

circulation act C — M.

    Hence the formula for the circuit of money capital is: M — C ... P

...  C’  —  M’,  the  dots  indicating  that  the  process  of  circulation  is

interrupted, and C’ and M’ designating C and M increased by surplus

value.

    The first and third stages were discussed in Book I only in so far

as this was necessary for the understanding of the second stage, the

process of production of capital. For this reason, the various forms

which capital takes on in its different stages, and which now assumes

and now strips off in the repetition of its circuit, were not considered.

These forms are now the direct object of our study.

    In order to conceive these forms in their pure state, one must first

of all discard all factors which have nothing to do with the changing or

building of forms as such. It is therefore taken for granted here not

only that the commodities are sold at their values but also that this

takes  place  under  the  same  conditions  throughout.  Likewise

disregarded  therefore  are  any  changes  of  value  which  might  occur

during the movement in circuits.

                                    I. FIRST STAGE. M—C    M — C represents the conversion of a sum of money into a sum

of  commodities;  the  purchaser  transforms  his  money  into

commodities,  the  sellers  transform  their  commodities  into  money.

What  renders  this  act  of  the  general circulation  of  commodities

simultaneously a functionally definite section in independent circuit of

some  individual  capital  is  primarily  not  the  form  of  the  act  but  its

material content, the specific use-character of the commodities which

change places with the money. These commodities are on the one

hand  means  of  production,  on  the  other  labor  power,  material  and

personal  factors  in  the  production  of  commodities  whose  specific

nature must of course correspond to the special kind of articles to be

manufactured. If we call labor power L, and the means of production

MP, then the sum of commodities to be bought, C, is equal to L + MP,
                        L
or  more  briefly  C<.  M  —C,  considered  as  to  its  substance  is
                          MP
                                                L
therefore  represented  by  M  —  C<,  that  is  to  say  M  —  C  is
                                                MP

composed of M — L and M — MP. The sum of money M is separated

into two parts, one of which buys labor power, the other means of

production. These two series of purchases belong to entirely different

markets,  the  one  to  the  commodity-market  proper,  the  other  to  the

labor market.

    [... In] brief, value exists here in the condition or form of productive

capital, which has the factor of creating value and surplus value. Let

us call capital in this form P.

    Now the value of P is equal to that of L + MP, it is equal to M

exchanged for L and MP. M is the same capital value as P, only it has

a different mode of existence, it is capital value in the state or form of

money — money capital.

    M  —  C,  or  its  general  form  M  —  C,  a  sum  of  purchases  of

commodities,  an  act  of  the  general circulation  of  commodities,  is

therefore at the same time — as a stage in the independent circuit of

capital — a transformation of capital value from its money form into its

productive form. More briefly, it is the transformation of money capital

into productive capital [...]

    M  —  L  is  the  characteristic  moment  in  the  transformation  of

money  capital  into  productive  capital,  because  it  is  the  essential

condition for the real transformation of value advanced in the form of

money into capital, into a value producing surplus value. M — MP isnecessary only for the purpose of realizing the quantity of labor bought

in the process M — L [.]

    [... Wages] are but a disguised form, a form in which for instance

the price of one day’s labor power presents itself as the price of the

labor  rendered  fluent  by  this  labor  power  in  one  day.  The  value

produced  by  this  labor  power  in,  say,  six  hours  of  labor  is  thus

expressed as the value of twelve hours’ functioning or operation of the

labor power.

    [...] In order that capital may be able to arise and take control of

production, a definite stage in the development of trade is assumed.

This  applies  therefore  also  to  the circulation  of  commodities,  and

hence  to  the  production  of  commodities;  for  no  articles  can  enter

circulation as commodities unless they are produced for sale, hence

as commodities. But the production of commodities does not become

the  normal,  dominant  type  of  production  until  capitalist  production

serves as its basis [...]

    It is therefore quite clear that the formula for the circuit of money

capital, M — C ... C — M’, is the matter-of-course form of the circuit of

capital only on the basis of already developed capitalist production,

because it presupposes the existence of a class of wage laborers on a

social scale. We have seen that capitalist production does not only

create commodities and surplus value, but also reproduces to an ever

increasing extent the class of wage laborers, into whom it transforms

the vast majority of direct producers. Since the first condition for its

realization is the permanent existence of a class of wage laborers, M

— C ... P ... C — M’ presupposes a capital in the form of productive

capital, and hence the form of the circuit of productive capital.

      II. SECOND STAGE. FUNCTION OF PRODUCTIVE CAPITAL

    The circuit of capital, which we have here considered, begins with

the  act  of  circulation  M  —  C,  the  transmutation  of  money  into

commodities  —  purchase.  Circulation  must  therefore  be

complemented  by  the  antithetical  metamorphosis  C  —  M,  the

transformation of commodities into money — sale. But the direct result
            L
of M — C< is the interruption of the circulation of the capital value
              MP

advanced  in  the  form  of  money.  By  the  transformation  of  money

capital into productive capital the capital value has acquired a bodily

form  in  which  it  cannot  continue  to  circulate  but  must  enter  intoconsumption,  viz.,  into  productive  consumption.  The  use  of  labor

power,  labor,  can  be  materialized  only  in  the  labor  process.  The

capitalist cannot resell the laborer as a commodity because he is not

his chattel slave and the capitalist has not bought anything except the

right to use his labor power for a certain time. On the other hand, the

capitalist cannot use this labor power in any other way than by utilizing

means of production to create commodities with its help. The result of

the first stage is therefore entrance into the second, the productive

stage of capital.
                                                              L
    This movement is represented by M — C<... P, in which the
                                                                MP

dots  indicate  that  the  circulation  of  capital  is  interrupted,  while  its

circular  movement  continues,  since  it  passes  from  the  sphere  of

circulation of commodities into that of production. The first stage, the

transformation  of  money  capital  into  productive  capital,  is  therefore

merely the harbinger and introductory phase of the second stage, the

functioning of productive capital.

    [... The] same conditions which give rise to the basic condition of

capitalist  production,  the  existence  of  a  class  of  wage  workers,

facilitate  the  transition  of  all  commodity  production  to  capitalist

commodity  production.  As  capitalist  production  develops,  it  has  a

disintegrating, resolvent effect on all older forms of production, which,

designed mostly to meet the direct needs of the producer, transform

only  the  excess  produced  into  commodities.  Capitalist  production

makes  the  sale  of  products  the  main  interest,  at  first  apparently

without affecting the mode of production itself. Such was for instance

the first effect of capitalist world commerce on such nations as the

Chinese,  Indians,  Arabs,  etc.  But,  secondly,  wherever  it  takes  root

capitalist production destroys all forms of commodity production which

are based either on the self-employment of the producers, or merely

on  the  sale  of  the  excess  product  as  commodities.  Capitalist

production  first  makes  the  production  of  commodities  general  and

then, by degrees, transforms all commodity production into capitalist

commodity production.

    Whatever the social form of production, laborers and means of

production  always  remain  factors  of  it.  But  in  a  state  of  separation

from each other either of these factors can be such only potentially.

For production to go on at all they must unite. The specific manner inwhich this union is accomplished distinguishes the different economic

epochs of the structure of society from one another. In the present

case, the separation of the free worker from his means of production

is the starting-point given, and we have seen how and under what

conditions these two elements are united in the hands of the capitalist,

namely, as the productive mode of existence of his capital. The actual

process  which  the  personal  and  material  creators  of  commodities

enter  upon  when  thus  brought  together,  the  process  of  production,

becomes therefore itself a function of capital, the capitalist process of

production, the nature of which has been fully analyzed in the first

book of this work. Every enterprise engaged in commodity production

becomes at the same time an enterprise exploiting labor power [...]

    Productive capital, in performing its functions, consumes its own

component parts for the purpose of transforming them into a mass of

products of a higher value. Since labor power acts merely as one of its

organs, the excess of the product’s value engendered by its surplus

labor  over  and  above  the  value  of  productive  capital’s  constituent

elements is also the fruit of capital. The surplus labor of labor power is

the gratuitous labor performed for capital and thus forms surplus value

for the capitalist, a value which costs him no equivalent return. The

product is therefore not only a commodity, but a commodity pregnant

with surplus value. Its value is equal to P + s, that is to say equal to

the value of the productive capital P consumed in the production of the

commodity plus the surplus values created by it. Let us assume that

this  commodity  consists  of  10,000  lbs.  of  yarn,  and  that  means  of

production worth £372 and labor power worth £50 were consumed in

the fabrication of this quantity of yarn. During the process of spinning,

the  spinners  transmitted  to  the  yarn  the  value  of  the  means  of

production consumed by their labor, amounting to £372, and at the

same time they created, in proportion with the labor power expended

by them, new value to the amount of, say, £128. The 10,000 lbs. of

yarn therefore represent a value of £500.

                              III. THIRD STAGE. C' -M'

    [...] Suppose the commodity of the capitalist to consist of 10,000

lbs.  of  cotton  yarn.  If  £372  represent  the  value  of  the  means  of

production consumed in the spinning process, and new value to the

amount  of  £128  has  been  created,  the  yarn  has  a  value  of  £500,which is expressed in its price of the same amount. Suppose further

that this price is realized by the sale C — M. What is it that makes of

this simple act of all commodity circulation at the same time a capital-

function? No change that takes place inside of it, neither in the use-

character of the commodity — for it passes into the hands of the buyer

as  an  object  of  use  —  nor  in  its  value,  for  this  value  has  not

experienced any change of magnitude, but only of form. It first existed

in the form of yarn, while now it exists in the form of money. Thus a

substantial distinction is evident between the first stage M — C and

the last stage C — M. There the advanced money functions as money

capital,  because  it  is  transformed  by  means  of  the  circulation  into

commodities of a specific use value. Here the commodities can serve

as capital only to the extent that they bring this character with them in

ready shape from the process of production before their circulation

begins. During the spinning process, the spinners create yarn value to

the amount of £128. Of this sum, say £50 represent to the capitalist

merely an equivalent for his outlay for labor power, while £78 — when

the  degree  of  exploitation  of  labor  power  is  156  per  cent  —  form

surplus value. The value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn therefore embodies

first the value of the consumed productive capital P, the constant part

of which amounts to £372 and the variable to £50, their sum being

£422, equal to 8,440 lbs. of yarn. Now the value of the productive

capital P is equal to C, the value of its constituent elements, which in

the  stage  M  —  C  confronted  the  capitalist  as  commodities  in  the

hands of their sellers.

    In the second place, however, the value of the yarn contains a

surplus value of £78, equal to 1,560 lbs. of yarn. C as an expression

of the value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn is therefore equal to C plus AC,

or C plus an increment of C (equal to £78), which we shall call c, since

it exists in the same commodity form as now the original value C. The

value  of  the  10,000  lbs.  of  yarn,  equal  to  £500,  is  therefore

represented by C + c = C'. What turns C, the expression of the value

of 10,000 lbs. of yarn, into C is not the absolute magnitude of its value

(£500), for that is determined, as in the case of any other C standing

for the expression of the value of some other sum of commodities, by

the quantity of labor embodied in it. It is its relative value magnitude,

its value magnitude as compared with that of capital P consumed in itsproduction. This value is contained in it plus the surplus value supplied

by  the  productive  capital.  Its  value  is  greater,  exceeds  that  of  the

capital value by this surplus value c. The 10,000 lbs. of yarn are the

bearers of the capital value expanded, enriched by this surplus value,

and they are so by virtue of being the product of the capitalist process

of production. C expresses a value relation, the relation of the value of

the  commodities  produced  to  that  of  the  capital  spent  on  their

production,  in  other  words,  expresses  the  fact  that  its  value  is

composed of capital value and surplus value. The 10,000 lbs. of yarn

represent commodity capital, C’, only because they are a converted

form of the productive capital P, hence in a connection which exists

originally only in the circuit of this individual capital, or only for the

capitalist who produced the yarn with the help of his capital. It is, so to

say, only an internal, not an external relation that turns the 10,000 lbs.

of yarn in their capacity of vehicles of value into a commodity capital.

They exhibit their capitalist birthmark not in the absolute magnitude of

their value but in its relative magnitude, in the magnitude of their value

as compared with that possessed by the productive capital embodied

in them before it was transformed into commodities. If, then, these

10,000  lbs.  of  yarn  are  sold  at  their  value  of  £500,  this  act  of

circulation,  considered  by  itself,  is  identical  with  C  —  M,  a  mere

transformation of an unchanging value from the form of a commodity

into that of money. But as a special stage in the circuit of an individual

capital, the same act is a realization of the capital value embodied in

the commodity to the amount of £422 plus the surplus value, likewise

embodied  in  it,  of  £78.  That  is  to  say  it  represents  C  —  M’,  the

transformation of the commodity capital from its commodity form into

the money form [...]

    The  mass  of  commodities  C’,  being  the  depository  of  the

expanded  capital,  must  furthermore  pass  in  its  entirety  through  the

metamorphosis  C’  —  M’.  The  quantity  sold  is  here  a  main

determinant. The individual commodity figures only as an integral part

of the total mass. The £500 worth of value exists in the 10,000 lbs. of

yarn. If the capitalist succeeds in selling only 7.440 lbs. at their value

of £372, he has replaced only the value of his constant capital, the

value of the expanded means of production. If he sells 8.440 lbs. he

recovers only the value of the total capital advanced. He must sellmore  in  order  to  realize  some  surplus  value,  and  he  must  sell  the

entire 10,000 lbs. in order to realize the surplus value of £78 (1,560

lbs. of yarn). In £500 in money he receives merely an equivalent for

the commodity sold. His transaction within the circulation is simply C

— M. If he had paid his laborers £64 in wages instead of £50 his

surplus value would only be £64 instead of £78, and the degree of

exploitation would have been only 100 per cent instead of 156. But the

value  of  the  yarn  would  not  change;  only  the  relation  between  its

component parts would be different. The circulation act C — M would

still represent the sale of 10,000 lbs. of yarn for £500, their value.

    C is equal to C + c (or £422 + £78). C equals the value of P, the

productive  capital,  and  this  equals  the  value  of  M,  the  money

advanced  in  M  —  C,  the  purchase  of  the  elements  of  production,

amounting to £422 in our example. If the mass of commodities is sold

at its value, then C equals £422 and c equals £78, the value of the

surplus product of 1,560 lbs. of yarn. If we call c, expressed in money,

m, then C — M’ = (C + c) — (M + m), and the Circuit M — C ... P ... C'

— M', in its expanded form, is therefore represented by M — C <L MP

... P... (C + c) — (M + m).

    In the first stage the capitalist takes articles of consumption out of

the commodity market proper and the labor market. In the third stage

he throws commodities back, but only into one market, the commodity

market proper. However, the fact that he extracts from the market, by

means  of  his  commodities,  a  greater  value  than  he  threw  upon  it

originally  is  due  only  to  the  circumstance  that  he  throws  more

commodity value back upon it than he first drew out of it. He threw

value M upon it and drew out of it the equivalent C; he throws C + c

back upon it, and draws out of it the equivalent M + m.

    M was in our example equal to the value of 8,440 lbs. of yarn. But

he throws 10,000 lbs. of yarn on the market, consequently he returns

a greater value than he took from it. On the other hand, he threw this

increased value on the market only because through the exploitation

of labor power in the process of production he had created surplus

value (as an aliquot part of the product expressed in surplus product).

It is only by virtue of being the product of this process that the mass of

commodities becomes commodity capital, the bearer of the expanded

capital value [...]                          IV. THE CIRCUIT AS A WHOLE

    We have seen that the process of circulation is interrupted at the
                                        L
end of its first phase, M — C<, by P, in which the commodities L
                                        MP

and MP bought in the market are consumed as the material and value

components of productive capital. The product of this consumption is

a new commodity, C’, altered in respect of substance and value. The

interrupted process of circulation, M — C, must be completed by C —

M. But the bearer of this second and concluding phase of circulation is

C’, a commodity different in substance and value from the original C.

The circulation series therefore appears as 1) M — C; 2) C’2 — M’,
                                                                      1

where  in  the  second  phase  of  the  first  commodity,  C1,  another

commodity of greater value and different use form, C’2, is substituted

during the interruption caused by the functioning of P, the production

of  C  from  the  elements  of  C,  the  forms  of  existence  of  productive

capital P. However, the first form of appearance in which capital faced

us, M — C — M’ (extended: 1) M — C1; 2) C1 — M’) shows the same

commodity  twice.  Both  times  it  is  the  same  commodity  into  which

money is transformed in the first phase and reconverted into more

money in the second phase. In spite of this essential difference, both

circulations  share  this  much:  that  in  their  first  phase  money  is

transformed  into  commodities,  and  in  the  second  commodities  into

money, that the money spent in the first phase returns in the second.

On the one hand both have in common this reflux of the money to its

starting-point,  on  the  other  hand  also  the  excess  of  the  returning

money over the money advanced. To that extent the formula M — C

... C' — M' is contained in the general formula M — C — M'.

    It follows furthermore that each time equally great quantities of

simultaneously existing values face and replace each other in the two

metamorphoses  M  —  C  and  C  —  M’  belonging  in  circulation.  The

change  in  value  pertains  exclusively  to  the  metamorphosis  P,  the

process of production, which thus appears as a real metamorphosis of

capital,  as  compared  with  the  merely  formal  metamorphosis  of

circulation.

    Let us now consider the total movement, M — C ... P ... C' — M',
                  L
< L or, M — C< ... P ... C' (C + c) — M' (M + m), its more expanded
                    MP

form. Capital here appears as a value which goes through a series of

interconnected,  interdependent  transformations,  a  series  ofmetamorphoses which form just as many phases, or stages, of the

process as a whole. Two of these phases belong in the sphere of

circulation, one of them in that of production. In each one of these

phases  capital  value  has  a  different  form  for  which  there  is  a

correspondingly different, special function. Within this movement the

advanced value does not only preserve itself but grows, increases in

magnitude. Finally, in the concluding stage, it returns to the same form

which it had at the beginning of the process as a whole. This process

as a whole constitutes therefore the process of moving in circuits.

    The two forms assumed by capital value at the various stages of

its circulation are those of money capital and commodity capital. The

form pertaining to the stage of production is that of productive capital.

The capital which assumes these forms in the course of its total circuit

and then discards them and in each of them performs the function

corresponding  to  the  particular  form,  is  industrial  capital,  industrial

here  in  the  sense  it  comprises  every  branch  of  industry  run  on  a

capitalist basis.

    Money capital, commodity capital and productive capital, do not

therefore designate independent kinds of capital whose functions form

the content of likewise independent branches of industry separated

from one another. They denote here only special functional forms of

industrial capital, which assumes all three of them one after the other.

    Capital describes its circuit normally only so long as its various

phases pass uninterruptedly into one another. If capital stops short in

the first phase M — C, money capital assumes the rigid form of a

hoard; if it stops in the phase of production, the means of production

lie  without  functioning  on  the  one  side,  while  labor  power  remains

unemployed on the other; and if capital stops short in the last phase C

— M’, piles of unsold commodities accumulate and clog the flow of

circulation [...]

    Let us finally consider M — C ... P ... C — M’ as a special form of

the circular course of capital, alongside the other forms which we shall

analyses later [.] It appears as the circuit of money capital, because

industrial  capital  in  its  money  form,  as  money  capital,  forms  the

starting-point and the point of return of its total process. The formula

itself  expresses  the  fact  that  the  money  is  not  expended  here  as

money but is merely advanced, hence is merely the money form ofcapital, money capital. It expresses furthermore that exchange value,

not use value, is the determining aim of this movement. Just because

the money form of value is the independent, tangible form in which

value appears, the form of circulation M ... M’, the initial and terminal

points  of  which  are  real  money,  expresses  most  graphically  the

compelling  motive  of  capitalist  production  —  money-making.  The

process of production appears merely as an unavoidable intermediate

link, as a necessary evil for the sake of money-making. All nations

with a capitalist mode of production are therefore seized periodically

by a feverish attempt to make money without the intervention of the

process of production [.]                  Chapter 2: The Circuit of Productive Capital



    The circuit of productive capital has the general formula P ... C' —

M' — C ... P. It signifies the periodical renewal of the functioning of

productive capital, hence its reproduction, or its process of production

as a process of reproduction aiming at the self-expansion of value; not

only  production  but  a  periodical  reproduction  of  surplus  value;  the

function of industrial capital in its productive form, and this function

performed not once but periodically repeated, so that the renewal is

determined by the starting-point. A portion of C may (in certain cases,

in various branches of industrial capital) re-enter directly as means of

production into the same labor process out of which it came in the

shape of a commodity. This merely saves the transformation of the

value  of  this  portion  into  real  money  or  token  money  or  else  the

commodity  finds  an  independent  expression  only  as  money  of

account. This part of value does not enter into the circulation. Thus

values enter into the process of production which do not enter into the

process  of  circulation.  The  same  is  true  of  that  part  of  C  which  is

consumed by the capitalist in natura as part of the surplus product.

But  this  is  insignificant  for  capitalist  production.  It  deserves

consideration, if at all, only in agriculture.

    Two things are at once strikingly apparent in this form.

    For  one  thing,  while  in  the  first  form,  M  ...  M’,  the  process  of

production, the function of P, interrupts the circulation of money capital

and acts only as a mediator between its two phases M — C and C —

M’, here the entire circulation process of industrial capital, its entire

movement  within  the  phase  of  circulation,  constitutes  only  an

interruption  and  consequently  only  the  connecting  link  between  the

productive capital, which as the first extreme opens the circuit, and

that which closes it as the other extreme in the same form, hence in

the form in which it starts again. Circulation proper appears but as an

instrument promoting the periodically renewed reproduction, rendered

continuous by the renewal.    For another thing, the entire circulation presents itself in a form

which  is  the  opposite  of  that  which  it  has  in  the  circuit  of  money

capital. There it was: M — C — M (M — C. C — M), apart from the

determination  of  value;  here  it  is,  again  apart  from  the  value

determination: C — M — C (C — M. M

    — C), i.e., the form of the simple circulation of commodities

                                I. SIMPLE REPRODUCTION

    Let us first consider the process C — M’ — C, which takes place

in the sphere of circulation between the two extremes P ... P.

    The starting-point of this circulation is commodity capital; C’ = C +

c = P + c. The function of commodity capital C’ — M’ (the realization of

the capital value contained in it equals P, which now exists as the

constituent part C of C’, as well as of the surplus value contained in it,

which exists as a constituent part of the same quantity of commodities

and has the value c) was examined in the first form of the circuit. But

there  this  function  formed  the  second  phase  of  the  interrupted

circulation and the concluding phase of the entire circuit. Here it forms

the second phase of the circuit but the first phase of the circulation.

The first circuit ends with M’, and since M’ as well as the original M

can  again  open  the  second  circuit  as  money  capital,  it  was  not

necessary at first to see whether M and m (surplus value) contained in

M’ continue in their course together or whether each of them pursues

its own course. This would only have become necessary if we had

followed up further the first circuit in its renewed course. But this point

must be decided in the circuit of the productive capital, because the

determination of its very first circuit depends on it and because C’ —

M’ appears in it as the first phase of the circulation, which has to be

complemented by M — C. It depends on this decision whether the

formula  represents  simple  reproduction  or  reproduction  on  an

extended scale. The character of the circuit changes according to the

decision made.

    Let us, then, consider first the simple reproduction of productive

capital,  assuming  that,  as  in  the  first  Chapter,  conditions  remain

constant and that commodities are bought and sold at their values.

    On  this  assumption  the  entire  surplus  value  enters  into  the

individual consumption of the capitalist. As soon as the transformation

of the commodity capital C’ into money has taken place, that part ofthe money which represents the capital value continues to circulate in

the circuit of industrial capital; the other part, which is surplus value

changed  into  money,  enters  into  the  general circulation  of

commodities, constitutes a circulation of money emanating from the

capitalist but taking place outside of the circulation of his individual

capital.

    In our illustration we had a commodity capital C’ of 10,000 lbs. of

yarn,  valued  at  £500;  £422  of  this  represent  the  value  of  the

productive capital and continue, as the money form of 8,440 lbs. of

yarn, the capital circulation begun by C’, while the surplus value of

£78,  the  money  form  of  1,560  lbs.  of  yarn,  the  excess  of  the

commodity product, leaves this circulation and describes a separate

course within the general circulation of commodities.

 








 

    m  —  c  represents  a  series  of  purchases  by  means  of  money

which  the  capitalist  spends  either  for  commodities  proper  or  for

personal services to his cherished self or family. These purchases are

made  piecemeal  at  various  times.  The  money  therefore  exists

temporarily  in  the  form  of  a  supply,  or  hoard,  destined  for  current

consumption,  since  money  whose  circulation  has  been  interrupted

assumes the form of a hoard. Its function as a medium of circulation,

which  includes  its  transient  form  of  a  hoard,  does  not  enter  the

circulation of capital in its money form M. This money is not advanced

but spent [...]

    The  circulation  of  C  and  c,  of  capital  value  and  surplus  value,

splits after the transformation of C into M’. Hence it follows:

    First, while the commodity capital is realized by C — M’ = C — (M

+ m), the movement of capital value and surplus value, which in C —

M’ is still united and carried on by the same quantity of commodities,becomes separable, both of them henceforth possessing independent

forms as separate sums of money.

    Secondly,  if  this  separation  takes  place,  m  being  spent  as  the

revenue of the capitalist, while M as a functional form of capital value

continues its course determined by the circuit, the first act, C’ — M’, in

connection with the subsequent acts, M — C and m — c, may be

represented as two different circulations C — M — C and c — m — c;

and both of these series, so far as their general form is concerned,

belong in the usual circulation of commodities [...]

    C’  acts  from  the  very  outset  as  commodity  capital,  and  the

purpose of the entire process, enrichment (the production of surplus

value), does not by any means exclude increasing consumption on the

part  of  the  capitalist  as  his  surplus  value  (and  hence  his  capital)

increases; on the contrary, it emphatically includes it.

    Indeed,  in  the  circulation  of  the  revenue  of  the  capitalist,  the

produced commodity c (or the fraction of the produced commodity C’

ideally corresponding to it) serves only to transform it, first into money,

and from money into a number of other commodities serving private

consumption.  But  we  must  not,  at  this  point,  overlook  the  trifling

circumstance  that  c  is  commodity  value  which  did  not  cost  the

capitalist anything, an incarnation of surplus labor, for which reason it

originally stepped on the stage as a component part of commodity

capital C’. [.]

            II. ACCUMULATION AND REPRODUCTION ON AN

                                EXTENDED SCALE

    [...]  We  considered  first  simple  reproduction,  assuming  that  the

entire  surplus  value  is  spent  as  revenue.  In  reality  under  normal

conditions  a  part  of  the  surplus  value  must  always  be  spent  as

revenue,  and  another  part  must  be  capitalized.  And  it  is  quite

immaterial whether a certain surplus value produced in any particular

period is entirely consumed or entirely capitalized. On the average —

the general formula can represent only the average movement — both

cases occur. But in order not to complicate the formula, it is better to

assume that the entire surplus value is accumulated. The formula:
                              L
    P ... C' — M — C<... P' stands for productive capital, which is
                              MP

reproduced on an enlarged scale and with greater value, and which as

augmented  productive  capital  begins  its  second  circuit,  or,  whatamounts to the same, renews its first circuit. As soon as this second

circuit is begun, we once more have P as the starting-point; only this P

is  a  larger  productive  capital  than  the  first  P  was.  Hence,  if  in  the

formula M ... M’ the second circuit begins with M’, M’ functions as M,

as an advanced money capital of a definite magnitude. It is a larger

money capital than the one with which the first circular movement was

opened, but all reference to its augmentation by the capitalization of

surplus value ceases as soon as it assumes the function of advanced

money capital. This origin is expunged in its form of money capital,

which begins its circuit. This also applies to P’ as soon as it functions

as the starting-point of a new circuit.

    If we compare P ... P’ with M ... M’, or with the first circuit, we find

that they have not the same significance at all. M ... M’ taken by itself

as an isolated circuit, expresses only that M, the money capital (or

industrial capital in its circuit as money capital), is money generating

money,  value  generating  value,  in  other  words,  produces  surplus

value. But in the P circuit the process of producing surplus value is

already completed upon the termination of the first stage, the process

of production, and after going through the second stage (the first stage

of  the  circulation),  C’  —  M’,  the  capital  value  plus  surplus  value

already exists as realized money capital, as M’, which appeared as

the  last  extreme  in  the  first  circuit.  That  surplus  value  has  been

produced  is  depicted  in  the  first-considered  formula  P  ...  P  (see

expanded formula [supra]) by c — m — c, which, in its second stage,

falls outside of the circulation of capital and represents the circulation

of surplus value as revenue. In this form, where the entire movement

is represented by P ... P, where consequently there is no difference in

value between the two extremes, the self-expansion of the advanced

value the production of surplus value, is therefore represented in the

same way as in M ... M’, except that the act C’ — M’, which appears

as the last stage in M ... M’, and as the second stage of the circuit,

serves as the first stage of the circulation in P ... P.

    In P ... P’, P’ does not indicate that the surplus value has been

produced but that the produced surplus value has been capitalized,

hence  that  capital  has  been  accumulated  and  that  therefore  P’,  in

contrast to P, consists of the original capital value plus the value of the

capital accumulated because of the capital value’s movement [...]                  Chapter 3: The Circuit of Commodity Capital



    The general formula for the circuit of commodity capital is:

    C' — M' — C ... P ... C'.

    C appears not alone as the product but also as the premise of the

two  previous  circuits,  since  that  which  M  —  C  means  for  the  one

capital C — M’ means for the other, inasmuch as at least a part of the

means of production is itself the commodity product of other individual

capitals  describing  their  circuits.  In  our  case  for  instance  coal,

machinery, etc., represent the commodity capital of the mine-owner, of

the  capitalist  machine-manufacturer,  etc.  Furthermore,  we  have

shown [in Chapter 1], that not only the circuit P ... P but also the circuit

C ... C is assumed even in the first repetition of M ... M’, before this

second circuit of money capital is completed.

    If reproduction takes place on an extended scale, then the final C

is greater than the initial C and should therefore be designated here

as C".

    The  difference  between  the  third  form  and  the  first  two  is  as

follows: First, in this case the total circulation with its two antithetical

phases  opens  the  circuit,  while  in  the  Form  I  the  circulation  is

interrupted  by  the  process  of  production  and  in  Form  II  the  total

circulation with its two complementary phases appears merely as a

means  of  effecting  the  process  of  reproduction  and  therefore

constitutes the movement mediating between P ... P. In the case of M

... M’, the form of circulation is M — C ... C — M’ = M — C — M. In the

case of P ... P it has the inverted form C’ — M’. M — C = C — M — C.

In the case of C’ — C’ it likewise has this form.

    Secondly,  when  circuits  I  and  II  are  repeated,  even  if  the  final

points M’ and P’ form the starting-points of the renewed circuit, the

form in which M’ and P’ were produced disappears. M’ = M plus m and

P’ = P plus p begin the new process as M and P. But in the form III the

starting-point  C  must  be  designated  as  C’,  even  if  the  circuit  is

renewed on the same scale, for the following reason. In Form I, assoon as M’ as such opens a new circuit it functions as money capital

M, as an advance in money form of the capital value that is to produce

surplus value. The size of the advanced money capital, augmented by

the accumulation achieved during the first circuit, has increased. But

whether the size of the advanced money capital is £422 or £500 does

not alter the fact that it appears as simple capital value. M’ no longer

exists  as  self-expanded  capital  or  a  capital  pregnant  with  surplus

value, as a capital relation. Indeed, it is to expand itself only during its

process.  The  same  is  true  of  P  ...  P’;  P’  must  steadily  continue  to

function as P, as capital value which is to produce surplus value, and

must renew its circuit.

    The commodity capital circuit, on the contrary, does not open with

just capital value but with capital value augmented in the commodity

form. Hence it includes from the start the circuit of not only capital

value existing in the form of commodities, but also of surplus value.

Consequently, if simple reproduction takes place in this form, the C at

the terminal point is equal in size to the C at the starting-point. If a part

of the surplus value enters into the capital circuit, C", an enlarged C’,

appears at the close instead of C’. This is merely a larger C than that

of  the  proceeding  circuit,  with  a  larger  accumulated  capital  value.

Hence it begins its new circuit with a relatively larger, newly created

surplus  value.  In  any  event  C  always  inaugurates  the  circuit  as  a

commodity capital which is equal to capital value plus surplus value

[...]                Chapter 4: The Three Formulas of the Circuit



    The  three  formulas  may  be  set  down  in  the  following  manner,

using Tc for total circulation process:

    I. M — C ... P ... C' — M'

    II. P ... Tc ... P

    III. Tc ... P (C)

    If we combine all three forms, all premises of the process appear

as its result, as a premise produced by it itself. Every element appears

as a point of departure, of transit, and of return. The total process

presents  itself  as  the  unity  of  the  processes  of  production  and

circulation. The process of production becomes the mediator of the

process of circulation and vice versa.

    All  three  circuits  have  the  following  in  common:  The  self-

expansion  of  value  as  the  determining  purpose,  as  the  compelling

motive. In I this is expressed in its form. Formula II begins with P, the

very process of creating surplus value. In III the circuit begins with the

self-expanded value, even if the movement is repeated on the same

scale.

    As C — M means M — C for the buyer, and M — C means C —

M for the seller, the circulation of capital presents only the ordinary

metamorphosis of commodities, and the laws evolved with regard to it

[...] on the mass of money in circulation are valid here. However, if we

do  not  cling  to  this  formal  aspect  but  rather  consider  the  actual

connection  between  the  metamorphoses  of  the  various  individual

capitals,  in  other  words,  if  we  study  the  connection  between  the

circuits of individual capitals as partial movements of the process of

reproduction of the total social capital, then the mere change of form

of money and commodities cannot explain the connection.

    In  a  constantly  revolving  circle  every  point  is  simultaneously  a

point of departure and a point of return. If we interrupt the rotation, not

every point of departure is a point of return. Thus we have seen that

not only does every individual circuit presuppose (implicite) the others,but also that the repetition of the circuit in one form comprises the

performance  of  the  circuit  in  the  other  forms.  The  entire  difference

thus appears to be a merely formal one, or as a merely subjective

distinction existing solely for the observer.

    Since every one of these circuits is considered a special form of

this  movement  in  which  various  individual  industrial  capitals  are

engaged, this difference exists only as an individual one. But in reality

every individual industrial capital is present simultaneously in all three

circuits. These three circuits, the forms of reproduction assumed by

the three forms of capital, are made continuously side by side. For

instance,  one  part  of  the  capital  value,  which  now  performs  the

function of commodity capital, is transformed into money capital, but at

the  same  time  another  part  leaves  the  process  of  production  and

enters the circulation as a new commodity capital. The circuit form C

... C is thus continuously described; and so are the other two forms.

The reproduction of capital in each one of its forms and stages is just

as  continuous  as  the  metamorphosis  of  these  forms  and  the

successive passage through the three stages. The entire circuit is thus

a unity of its three forms [...]

    Capital as self-expanding value embraces not only class relations,

a society of a definite character resting on the existence of labor in the

form  of  wage  labor.  It  is  a  movement,  a  circuit-describing  process

going  through  various  stages,  which  itself  comprises  three  different

forms of circuit-describing process. Therefore, it can be understood

only as a motion, not as a thing at rest [...]                        Chapter 5: The Time of Circulation



    We have seen that the movement of capital through the sphere of

production and the two phases of the sphere of circulation takes place

in a series of periods of time. The duration of its sojourn in the sphere

of production is its time of production, that of its stay in the sphere of

circulation  its  time  of  circulation.  The  total  time  during  which  it

describes  its  circuit  is  therefore  equal  to  the  sum  of  its  time  of

production and its time of circulation.

    The time of production naturally comprises the period of the labor

process, but is not comprised in it [...] Periodical interruptions of the

labor process, by night for instance, interrupt the functioning of these

instruments of labor, but not their stay at the place of production. They

belong to this place when they are in function as well as when they

are not. On the other hand, the capitalist must have a definite supply

of raw material and auxiliary material in readiness, in order that the

process of production may take place for a longer or shorter time on a

previously  determined  scale,  without  being  dependent  on  the

accidents of daily supply from the market. This supply of raw material,

etc., is productively consumed only by degrees. There is, therefore, a

difference between its time of production and its time of functioning.

The  time  of  production  of  the  means  of  production  in  general

comprises, therefore, 1) the time during which they function as means

of  production,  hence  serve  in  the  productive  process;  2)  the  stops

during which the process of production, and thus the functioning of the

means of production embodied in it, are interrupted; 3) the time during

which  they  are  held  in  readiness  as  prerequisites  of  that  process,

hence already represent productive capital but have not yet entered

into the process of production.

    The  difference  so  far  considered  has  in  each  case  been  the

difference between the time which the productive capital stays in the

sphere of production and that it stays in the process of production. But

the process of production may itself be responsible for interruptions ofthe  labor  process,  and  hence  of  the  labor  time  —  intervals  during

which  the  subject  of  labor  is  exposed  to  the  action  of  physical

processes  without  the  further  intervention  of  human  labor.  The

process  of  production,  and  thus  the  functioning  of  the  means  of

production, continue in this case, although the labor process, and thus

the functioning of the means of production as instruments of labor,

have been interrupted. This applies, for instance, to the grain, after it

has been sown, the wine fermenting in the cellar, the labor-material of

many factories, such as tanneries, where the material is exposed to

the  action  of  chemical  processes.  The  time  of  production  is  here

longer than the labor time. The difference between the two consists in

an  excess  of  the  production  time  over  the  labor  time.  This  excess

always  arises  from  the  latent  existence  of  productive  capital  in  the

sphere of production without functioning in the process of production

itself or from its functioning in the productive process without taking

part in the labor process [...]

    The intervals in the labor time which the subject of labor must

endure  in  the  process  of  production  itself  create  neither  value  nor

surplus value. But they advance the product, form a part of its life, a

process through which it must pass. The value of the apparatus, etc.,

is  transferred  to  the  product  in  proportion  to  the  entire  time  during

which they perform their function; the product is brought to this stage

by labor itself, and the employment of these apparatus is as much a

condition  of  production  as  is  the  reduction  to  dust  of  a  part  of  the

cotton which does not enter into the product but nevertheless transfers

its value to the product. The other part of the latent capital, such as

buildings, machinery, etc., the instruments of labor whose functioning

is interrupted only by the regular pauses of the productive process —

irregular interruptions caused by the restriction of production, crises,

etc., are total losses — adds value without entering into the creation of

the  product.  The  total  value  which  this  part  of  capital  adds  to  the

product is determined by its average durability; it loses value, because

it loses its use value, both during the time that it performs its functions

as well as during that in which it does not.

    Finally, the value of the constant part of capital, which continues

in the productive process although the labor process is interrupted, re-

appears  in  the  result  of  the  productive  process  [...]  Labor  alwaystransfers the value of the means of production to the product, in so far

as  it  really  consumes  them  in  a  suitable  manner,  as  means  of

production. And it does not change the matter whether labor has to

bear continually on its subject by means of the instruments of labor in

order to produce this effect or whether it merely needs to give the first

impulse by providing the means of production with conditions under

which  they  undergo  the  intended  alteration  of  themselves,  in

consequence of natural processes, without the further assistance of

labor.

    Whatever may be the reason for the excess of production time

over  the  labor  time  —  whether  the  circumstance  that  means  of

production constitute only latent productive capital and hence are still

in a stage preliminary to the actual productive process or that their

own functioning is interrupted within the process of production by its

pauses  or  finally  that  the  process  of  production  itself  necessitates

interruptions of the labor process — in none of these cases do the

means of production function as absorbers of labor. And if they do not

absorb labor, they do not absorb surplus labor, either. Hence there is

no expansion of the value of productive capital so long as it stays in

that part of its production time which exceeds the labor time, no matter

how inseparable from these pauses the carrying on of the process of

self-expansion may be [.]

    The time of production, then, is always that time in which a capital

produces  use  values  and  expands,  hence  functions  as  productive

capital, although it includes time in which it is either latent or produces

without expanding its value [.]

    Time of circulation and time of production mutually exclude each

other.  During  its  time  of  circulation  capital  does  not  perform  the

functions  of  productive  capital  and  therefore  produces  neither

commodities nor surplus value [...] The expansion and contraction of

the  time  of  circulation  operate  therefore  as  negative  limits  to  the

contraction or expansion of the time of production or of the extent to

which a capital of a given size functions as productive capital [...]

    [...] The time of circulation is but a phase of the time of turnover;

the latter however includes the time of production or reproduction [.]                        Chapter 6: The Costs of Circulation



    I. Genuine Costs of Circulation


    1. THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND SALE

    [...] To the capitalist who has others working for him, buying and

selling becomes a primary function. Since he appropriates the product

of many on a large social scale, he must sell it on the same scale and

then  reconvert  it  from  money  into  elements  of  production.  Now  as

before neither the time of purchase nor of sale creates any value [...

Commerce belongs] to the faux frais of production [... and] constitutes

merely a part of the costs of circulation.

    2. BOOKKEEPING

    Apart from the actual buying and selling, labor time is expended

on bookkeeping, which besides absorbs materialized labor such as

pens, ink, paper, desks, office paraphernalia. This function, therefore,

exacts the expenditure on the one hand of labor power and on the

other of instruments of labor.  It  is  the  same  condition  of  things  as

obtained in the case of the time of purchase and sale [... It] is palpably

clear that this function and the instruments of labor consumed by it,

such as paper, etc., represent additional consumption of labor time

and instruments which are necessary, but constitute a deduction from

the  time  available  for  productive  consumption  as  well  as  from  the

instruments of labor which function in the real process of production

[and] enter into the creation of products and value [...] But there is a

certain difference between the costs incidental to bookkeeping, or the

unproductive expenditure of labor time on the one hand and those of

mere buying and selling time on the other. The latter arise only from

the definite social form of the process of production, from the fact that

it is the process of production of commodities. Bookkeeping, as the

control  and  ideal  synthesis  of  the  process,  becomes  the  more

necessary the more the process assumes a social scale and loses its

purely individual character. It is therefore more necessary in capitalistproduction than in the scattered production of handicraft and peasant

economy [.]

    3. MONEY

    Whether  a  product  is  fabricated  as  a  commodity  or  not,  it  is

always a material form of wealth, a use value intended for individual or

productive consumption. Its value as a commodity is ideally expressed

in its price, which does not change its actual use form in the least. But

the  fact  that  certain  commodities  like  gold  and  silver  function  as

money and as such reside exclusively in the process of circulation

(even in the form of hoards, reserve funds, etc., they remain in the

sphere  of  circulation,  although  latently)  is  a  pure  product  of  the

particular  social  form  of  the  process  of  production,  the  process  of

production of commodities. Since under capitalist production products

assume the general form of commodities, and the overwhelming mass

of products is created as commodities and must therefore assume the

form of money, and since the vast bulk of commodities, the part of

social wealth functioning as commodities, grows continually, it follows

that the quantity of gold and silver functioning as means of circulation,

paying  medium,  reserve  fund,  etc.,  likewise  increases.  These

commodities  performing  the  function  of  money  enter  into  neither

individual nor productive consumption. They represent social labor in

a fixed form in which it serves as a mere circulation machine. Besides

the fact that a part of social wealth has been condemned to assume

this unproductive form, the wearing down of the money demands its

constant replacement, or the conversion of more social labor, in the

form of products, into more gold and silver. These replacement costs

are  considerable  in  capitalistically  developed  nations,  because  in

general  the  portion  of  wealth  tied  up  in  the  form  of  money  is

tremendous. Gold and silver as money commodities mean circulation

costs to society which arise solely out of the social form of production.

They  are  faux  frais  of  commodity  production  in  general,  and  they

increase  with  the  development  of  this  production,  especially  of

capitalist production. They represent a part of the social wealth that

must be sacrificed to the process of circulation



    II. Costs of Storage    Costs of circulation, which originate in a mere change of form of

value, in circulation, ideally considered, do not enter into the value of

commodities. The parts of capital expended as such costs are merely

deductions  from  the  productively  expended  capital  so  far  as  the

capitalist  is  concerned.  The  costs  of  circulation  which  we  shall

consider now are of a different nature. They may arise from processes

of production which are only continued in circulation, the productive

character of which is hence merely concealed by the circulation form.

On the other hand, they may be, from the standpoint of society, mere

costs, unproductive expenditure of living or materialized labor, but for

that very reason they become productive of value for the individual

capitalist,  may  constitute  an  addition  to  the  selling  price  of  his

commodities. This already follows from the fact that these costs are

different in different spheres of production, and here and there even

for  different  individual  capitals  in  one  and  the  same  sphere  of

production.  By  being  added  to  the  prices  of  commodities  they  are

distributed in proportion to the amount to be borne by each individual

capitalist. But all labor which adds value can also add surplus value,

and will always add surplus value under capitalist production, as the

value  created  by  labor  depends  on  the  amount  of  the  labor  itself,

whereas  the  surplus  value  created  by  it  depends  on  the  extent  to

which the capitalist pays for it. Consequently, costs which enhance the

price of a commodity without adding to its use value, which therefore

are  to  be  classed  as  unproductive  expenses  so  far  as  society  is

concerned, may be a source of enrichment to the individual capitalist.

On  the  other  hand,  as  this  addition  to  the  price  of  the  commodity

merely  distributes  these  costs  of  circulation  equally,  they  do  not

thereby  cease  to  be  unproductive  in  character.  For  instance,

insurance companies divide the losses of individual capitalists among

the capitalist class. But this does not prevent these equalized losses

from  remaining  losses  so  far  as  the  aggregate  social  capital  is

concerned.

    1. FORMATION OF SUPPLY IN GENERAL

    [...] The abidance of the commodity capital as a commodity supply

in the market requires buildings, stores, storage places, warehouses,

in other words, an expenditure of constant capital; furthermore, the

payment  of  labor  power  for  placing  the  commodities  in  storage.Besides,  commodities  spoil  and  are  exposed  to  the  injurious

influences of the elements. Additional capital must be invested, partly

in instruments of labor, in material form, and partly in labor power to

protect the commodities against the above.

    Thus the existence of capital in its form of commodity capital and

hence of commodity supply gives rise to costs which must be classed

as costs of circulation, since they do not come within the sphere of

production.  These  costs  of  circulation  differ  from  those  mentioned

under I by the fact that they enter to a certain extent into the value of

the commodities, i.e., they increase the prices of commodities. At all

events the capital and labor power which serve the need of preserving

and  storing  the  commodity  supply  are  withdrawn  from  the  direct

process of production. On the other hand, the capitals thus employed,

including labor power as a constituent of capital, must be replaced out

of  the  social  product.  Their  expenditure  has  therefore  the  effect  of

diminishing the productive power of labor, so that a greater amount of

capital and labor is required to obtain a particular useful effect. They

are unproductive costs [...]

    As a matter of fact, supplies exist in three forms: in the form of

productive capital, in the form of a fund for individual consumption,

and  in  the  form  of  a  commodity  supply  or  commodity  capital.  The

supply in one form decreases relatively when it increases in another,

although  its  quantity  may  increase  absolutely  in  all  three  forms

simultaneously [.]

    2. THE COMMODITY SUPPLY PROPER

    [...] Only to the extent that the commodity supply is a premise of

commodity  circulation  and  is  itself  a  form  necessarily  arising  in

commodity  circulation,  only  in  so  far  as  this  apparent  stagnation  is

therefore  a  form  of  the  movement  itself,  just  as  the  formation  of  a

money reserve is a premise of money circulation — only to that extent

is such stagnation normal. But as soon as the commodities lying in the

reservoirs of circulation do not make room for the swiftly succeeding

wave of production, so that the reservoirs become over-stocked, the

commodity  supply  expands  in  consequence  of  the  stagnation  in

circulation  just  as  the  hoards  increase  when  money  circulation  is

clogged. It does not make any difference whether this jam occurs in

the warehouses of the industrial capitalist or in the storerooms of themerchant. The commodity supply is in that case not a prerequisite of

uninterrupted sale, but a consequence of the impossibility of selling

the goods. The costs are the same, but since they now arise purely

out of the form, that is to say, out of the necessity of transforming the

commodities into money and out of the difficulty of going through this

metamorphosis, they do not enter into the values of the commodities

but  constitute  deductions,  losses  of  value  in  the  realization  of  the

value. Since the normal and abnormal forms of the supply do not differ

in form and both clog circulation, these phenomena may be confused

and deceive the agent of production himself so much the more since

for the producer the process of circulation of his capital may continue

while that of his commodities which have changed hands and now

belong to merchants may be arrested. If production and consumption

swell,  other  things  being  equal,  then  the  commodity  supply  swells

likewise. It is renewed and absorbed just as fast, but its size is greater.

Hence the bulging size of the commodity supply, for which stagnant

circulation  is  responsible,  may  be  mistaken  for  a  symptom  of  the

expansion  of  the  process  of  reproduction,  especially  when  the

development of the credit system makes it possible to wrap the real

movement in mystery [.]



    III. Costs of Transportation


    It is not necessary to go here into all the details of the costs of

circulation, such as packing, sorting, etc. The general law is that all

costs  of  circulation,  which  arise  only  from  changes  in  the  forms  of

commodities  do  not  add  to  their  value.  They  are  merely  expenses

incurred in the realization of the value or in its conversion from one

form into another. The capital spent to meet those costs (including the

labor done under its control) belongs among the faux frais of capitalist

production.  They  must  be  replaced  from  the  surplus  product  and

constitute,  as  far  as  the  entire  capitalist  class  is  concerned,  a

deduction from the surplus value or surplus product, just as the time a

laborer needs for the purchase of his means of subsistence is lost

time. But the costs of transportation play a too important part to pass

them by without a few brief remarks.    [...  The]  use  value  of  things  is  materialized  only  in  their

consumption,  and  their  consumption  may  necessitate  a  change  of

location of these things, hence may require an additional process of

production, in the transport industry. The productive capital invested in

this  industry  imparts  value  to  the  transported  products,  partly  by

transferring value from the means of transportation, partly by adding

value  through  the  labor  performed  in  transport.  This  last-named

increment of value consists, as it does in all capitalist production, of a

replacement of wages and of surplus value.

    Within each process of production, a great role is played by the

change of location of the subject of labor and the required instruments

of labor and labor power — such as cotton trucked from the carding to

the spinning room or coal hoisted from the shaft to the surface. The

transition  of  the  finished  product  as  finished  goods  from  one

independent  place  of  production  to  another  located  at  a  distance

shows the same phenomenon, only on a larger scale. The transport of

products from one productive establishment to another is furthermore

followed by the passage of the finished products from the sphere of

production  to  that  of  consumption.  The  product  is  not  ready  for

consumption until it has completed these movements.

    As was shown above, the general law of commodity production

holds: The productivity of labor is inversely proportional to the value

created by it. This is true of the transport industry as well as of any

other. The smaller the amount of dead and living labor required for the

transportation of commodities over a certain distance, the greater the

productive power of labor, and vice versa [.]

    The  transport  industry  forms  on  the  one  hand  an  independent

branch  of  production  and  thus  a  separate  sphere  of  investment  of

productive capital. On the other hand, its distinguishing feature is that

it  appears  as  a  continuation  of  a  process  of  production  within  the

process of circulation and for the process of circulation.                PART 2: THE TURNOVER OF CAPITAL    Chapter 7: The Turnover Time and The Number of Turnovers



    We have seen that the entire time of turnover of a given capital is

equal to the sum of its time of circulation and its time of production. It

is the period of time from the moment of the advance of capital value

in a definite form to the return of the functioning capital value in the

same form [...] A circuit performed by a capital and meant to be a

periodical  process,  not  an  individual  act,  is  called  its  turnover.  The

duration  of  this  turnover  is  determined  by  the  sum  of  its  time  of

production and its time of circulation. This time total constitutes the

time of turnover of the capital. It measures the interval of time between

one  circuit  period  of  the  entire  capital  value  and  the  next,  the

periodicity in the process of life of capital or, if you like, the time of the

renewal, the repetition, of the process of self-expansion, or production,

of  one  and  the  same  capital  value  [...]  Apart  from  the  individual

adventures which may accelerate or shorten the time of turnover of

certain capitals, this time differs in the different spheres of investment.

Just as the working day is the natural unit for measuring the function

of  labor  power,  so  the  year  is  the  natural  unit  for  measuring  the

turnovers of functioning capital. The natural basis of this unit is the

circumstance that the most important crops of the temperate zone,

which  is  the  mother  country  of  capitalist  production,  are  annual

products.  If  we  designate  the  year  as  the  unit  of  measure  of  the

turnover time by T, the time of turnover of a given capital by t, and the

number of its turnovers by n, then n = T/t. If, for instance, the time of

turnover t is 3 months, then n is equal to 12/3, or 4; capital is turned

over four times per year. If t = 18 months, then n = 12/18 = 2A, or

capital completes only two-thirds of its turnover in one year. If its time

of turnover is several years, it is computed in multiples of one year.

From the point of view of the capitalist, the time of turnover of his

capital is the time for which he must advance his capital in order to

create surplus value with it and receive it back in its original shape [...]              Chapter 8: Fixed Capital and Circulating Capital



    I. Distinctions of Form


    We  have  seen  [...]  that,  in  relation  to  the  products  toward  the

creation of which it contributes, a portion of the constant capital retains

that definite use form in which it enters into the process of production.

Hence it performs the same functions for a longer or shorter period, in

ever repeated labor processes. This applies for instance to industrial

buildings, machinery, etc. — in short to all things which we comprise

under the name of Instruments of labor. This part of constant capital

yields  up  value  to  the  product  in  proportion  as  it  loses  its  own

exchange value together with its own use value. This delivery of value,

or this transition of the value of such a means of production to the

product  which  it  helps  to  create  is  determined  by  a  calculation  of

averages. It is measured by the average duration of its function, from

the moment that the means of production enters into the process of

production to the moment that it is completely spent, dead and gone,

and  must  be  replaced  by  a  new  sample  of  the  same  kind,  or

reproduced [...]

    A portion of the advanced capital value becomes fixed in this form

determined by the function of the instruments of labor in the process.

In the performance of this function, and thus by the wear and tear of

the instruments of labor, a part of their value passes on to the product,

while the other remains fixed in the instruments of labor and thus in

the  process  of  production.  The  value  fixed  in  this  way  decreases

steadily, until the instrument of labor is worn out, its value having been

distributed during a shorter or longer period over a mass of products

originating from a series of constantly repeated labor processes. But

so long as they are still effective as instruments of labor and need not

yet be replaced by new ones of the same kind, a certain amount of

constant capital value remains fixed in them, while the other part of

the  value  originally  fixed  in  them  is  transferred  to  the  product  andtherefore  circulates  as  a  component  part  of  the  commodity  supply.

The longer an instrument lasts, the slower it wears out, the longer will

its constant capital value remains fixed in this use form. But whatever

may be its durability, the proportion in which it yields value is always

inverse to the entire time it functions. If of two machines of equal value

one wears out in five years and the other in ten, then the first yields

twice as much value in the same time as the second [...] It is this

peculiarity which gives to this portion of constant capital the form of

fixed capital.

    All the other material parts of capital advanced in the process of

production form by way of contrast the circulating, or fluid, capital [...]

Such are auxiliary materials, which are consumed by the instruments

of labor  themselves  in  the  performance  of  their  functions,  like  coal

consumed by a steam-engine [... They] are entirely consumed in every

labor process which they enter and must therefore be wholly replaced

by  new  means  of  production  of  the  same  kind  in  every  new  labor

process [...] Cattle as beasts of toil are fixed capital; as beef cattle

they are raw material which finally enters into circulation as a product;

hence they are circulating, not fixed capital [...] These components of

the productive capital — the parts of its value invested in labor power

and in means of production which do not constitute fixed capital — by

reason  of  their  common  turnover  characteristics  confront  the  fixed

capital as circulating or fluent capital [...]

    The value of the circulating capital — in labor power and means of

production — is advanced only for the time during which the product is

in process of production, in accordance with the scale of production

determined  by  the  volume  of  the  fixed  capital.  This  value  enters

entirely into the product, is therefore fully returned by its sale from the

sphere of circulation, and can be advanced anew.

    [... It] is only the productive capital which can be divided into fixed

and circulating capital. But this antithesis does not apply to the other

two modes of existence of industrial capital, that is to say, commodity

capital and money capital, nor does it exist as an antithesis of these

two modes to productive capital. It exists only for productive capital

and  within  its  sphere.  No  matter  how  much  money  capital  and

commodity capital may function as capital and no matter how fluently

they may circulate, they cannot become circulating capital as distinctfrom  fixed  capital  until  they  are  transformed  into  circulating

components of productive capital.

    [...]  The  turnover  of  the  fixed  component  part  of  capital,  and

therefore also the time of turnover necessary for it, comprises several

turnovers of the circulating constituents of capital. In the time during

which the fixed capital turns over once, the circulating capital turns

over several times [...]



    II. Components. Replacement, Repair, And Accumulation of

Fixed Capital


    [...] The fixed capital however requires also a positive expenditure

of labor for its maintenance in good repair. The machinery must be

cleaned  from  time  to  time.  It  is  a  question  here  of  additional  labor

without  which  the  machinery  becomes  useless  [...]  It  is  here  not  a

question  of  replacing  the  labor  contained  in  the  machine,  but  of

constant  additional  labor  made  necessary  by  its  use.  It  is  not  a

question of labor performed by the machine, but of labor spent on it, of

labor in which it is not an agent of production but raw material. The

capital expended for this labor must be classed as circulating capital,

although it does not enter into the labor process proper to which the

product owes its existence. This labor must be continually expended

in production; hence its value must be continually replaced by that of

the product. The capital invested in it belongs in that part of circulating

capital  which  has  to  cover  the unproductive  costs  and  is  to  be

distributed over the produced values according to an annual average

calculation [.]

    The  damage  which  separate  parts  of  the  machinery,  etc.,  may

incur is naturally accidental and so are therefore the repairs involved

[...  In]  spite  of  its  accidental  character  repair  work  is  unevenly

distributed over the various periods of life of fixed capital.

    [... It] is taken for granted in estimating the average life of fixed

capital  that  it  is  constantly  kept  in  good  working  order,  partly  by

cleaning (including the cleaning of the premises), partly by repairs as

often as required. The transfer of value through wear and tear of fixed

capital is calculated on its average life, but this average life itself isbased  on  the  assumption  that  the  additional  capital  required  for

maintenance purposes is continually advanced.

    But  then  it  is  also  evident  that  the  value  added  by  this  extra

expenditure  of  capital  and  labor  cannot  enter  into  the  price  of  the

commodities  concerned  at  the  same  time  as  it  is  incurred.  For

example, a manufacturer of yarn cannot sell his yarn dearer this week

than last, merely because one of his wheels broke or a belt tore this

week. The general costs of spinning have not been changed in any

way  by  this  accident  in  some  individual  factory.  Here,  as  in  all

determinations of value, the average decides. Experience shows the

average occurrence of such accidents and the average volume of the

maintenance and repair work necessary during the average life of the

fixed  capital  invested  in  a  given  branch  of  business.  This  average

expense is distributed over the average life and added to the price of

the  product  in  corresponding  aliquot  parts;  hence  it  is  replaced  by

means of its sale.

    The  additional  capital  which  is  thus  replaced  belongs  to  the

circulating capital, although the manner of its expenditure is irregular

[...] This capital, expended in repairs properly so called, is in many

respects  a  capital  sui  generis,  which  can  be  classed  neither  as

circulating nor as fixed capital, but belongs with greater justification to

the former, since it figures among the running expenses [.]        Chapter 9: The Aggregate Turnover of Advanced Capital.

                                Cycles of Turnover



    We have seen that the fixed and circulating component parts of

productive  capital  are  turned  over  in  various  ways  and  at  various

periods, also that the different constituents of the fixed capital of a

business  have  different  periods  of  turnover,  depending  on  their

different  durabilities  and  therefore  on  their  different  times  of

reproduction [...] The aggregate turnover of an advanced capital is the

average turnover of its various constituent parts [...] Suppose the fixed

capital  is  £80,000  and  its  period  of  reproduction  10  years,  so  that

£8,000 of it annually return to their money form, or it completes one-

tenth of its turnover. Suppose further the circulating capital is £20,000,

and  its  turnover  is  completed  five  times  per  year.  The  total  capital

would then be £100,000. The turned-over fixed capital is £8,000, the

turned-over circulating capital five times £20,000, or £100,000. Then

the capital turned over during one year is £108,000, or £8,000 more

than the advanced capital. 1 + 2/25 of the capital have been turned

over [.]

    Therefore, the turnover time of the value of the advanced capital

differs from its actual time of reproduction or from the actual time of

turnover of its component parts. Take for instance a capital of £4,000

and let it turn over, say, five times a year. The turned-over capital is

then five times £4,000, or £20,000. But what returns at the end of

each turnover to be advanced anew is the originally advanced capital

of £4,000. Its magnitude is not changed by the number of turnover

periods, during which it performs anew its functions as capital. (Apart

from surplus value.) [...]

    As the magnitude of the value and the durability of the applied

fixed capital develop with the development of the capitalist mode of

production, the lifetime of industry and of industrial capital lengthens in

each particular field of investment to a period of many years, say of

ten years on an average. Whereas the development of fixed capitalextends the length of this life on the one hand it is shortened on the

other by the continuous revolution in the means of production, which

likewise  incessantly  gains  momentum  with  the  development  of  the

capitalist mode of production. This involves a change in the means of

production  and  the  necessity  of  their  constant  replacement,  on

account of moral depreciation [= technical or functional obsolescence]

long  before  they  expire  physically.  One  may  assume  that  in  the

essential branches of modern industry this life-cycle now averages ten

years. However, we are not concerned here with the exact figure. This

much is evident: the cycle of interconnected turnovers embracing a

number of years, in which capital is held fast by its fixed constituent

part,  furnishes  a  material  basis  for  the  periodic  crises.  During  this

cycle business undergoes successive periods of depression, medium

activity, precipitancy, crisis. True, periods in which capital is invested

differ greatly and far from coincide in time. But a crisis always forms

the starting-point of large new investments [and therefore], from the

point of view of society as a whole, more or less, a new material basis

for the next turnover cycle [.]                          Chapter 10: The Working Period



    Let us take two branches of business with working days of equal

length, say, of ten hours each, one of them a cotton spinning-mill, the

other a locomotive works. In one of these branches a definite quantity

of finished product, cotton yarn, is turned out daily or weekly; in the

other, the labor process has to be repeated for perhaps three months

in order to manufacture a finished product, a locomotive [... When] we

speak of a working period we mean the number of connected working

days required in a certain branch of industry for the manufacture of a

finished product [.] We have assumed that capitals of equal size are

invested in spinning and machine-building, that these capitals contain

equal  proportions  of  constant  and  variable,  fixed  and  circulating

capital,  that  the  working  days  are  of  equal  length,  in  brief,  that  all

conditions are equal except the duration of the working period. In the

first  week,  the  outlay  for  both  is  the  same,  but  the  product  of  the

spinner can be sold and the proceeds of the sale used to buy new

labor  power,  new  raw  materials,  etc.;  in  short,  production  can  be

resumed on the same scale. The machine-manufacturer on the other

hand  cannot  reconvert  the  circulating  capital  expended  in  the  first

week  into  money  and  resume  operations  with  it  until  three  months

later, when his product is finished.

    There is therefore first a difference in the return of the identical

quantities  of  capital  invested.  But  in  the  second  place  identical

amounts of productive capital are employed during the three months

in both spinning and machine-building. However, the magnitude of the

outlay of capital in the case of the yarn manufacturer is quite different

from that of the machine-builder; for in the one case the same capital

is rapidly renewed and the same operation can therefore be repeated,

while in the other case the renewal of the capital is relatively slow, so

that ever new quantities of capital must be added to the old up to the

time of its renewal. Consequently, there is a difference not only in the

length of time of renewal of definite portions of capital, or in the lengthof time for which the capital is advanced, but also in the quantity of the

capital to be advanced according to the duration of the labor process

(although  the  capitals  employed  daily  or  weekly  are  equal).  This

circumstance  is  worthy  of  note  for  the  reason  that  the  term  of  the

advance may be prolonged, as we shall see in the cases treated in the

next Chapter, without thereby necessitating a corresponding increase

in  the  amount  of  the  capital  to  be  advanced.  The  capital  must  be

advanced for a longer time, and a larger amount of capital is tied up in

the form of productive capital [...]

    Conditions such as cooperation, division of labor, application of

machinery, which augment the product of the individual working day,

shorten  at  the  same  time  the  working  period  of  connected  acts  of

production.  Thus  machinery  shortens  the  building  time  of  houses,

bridges, etc. [...] Greater speed due to improved shipbuilding cuts the

turnover time of capital invested in shipping [...]                        Chapter 11: The Time of Production



    Working time is always production time, that is to say, time during

which capital is held fast in the sphere of production. But vice versa,

not  all  time  during  which  capital  is  engaged  in  the  process  of

production is necessarily working time.

    It  is  here  not  a  question  of  interruptions  of  the  labor  process

necessitated by natural limitations of the labor power itself, although

we have seen to what extent the mere circumstance that fixed capital

— factory buildings, machinery, etc. — lies idle during pauses in the

labor  process,  became  one  of  the  motives  for  an  unnatural

prolongation of the labor process and for day-and-night work. We are

dealing here rather with interruptions independent of the length of the

labor process, brought about by the very nature of the product and its

fabrication, during which the subject of labor is for a longer or shorter

time subjected to natural processes, must undergo physical, chemical

and physiological changes, during which the labor process is entirely

or partially suspended.

    For instance, grape after being pressed must ferment awhile and

then  rest  for  some  time  in  order  to  reach  a  certain  degree  of

perfection.  In  many  branches  of  industry,  the  product  must  pass

through a drying process, for instance in pottery, or be exposed to

certain conditions in order to change its chemical properties, as for

instance  in  bleaching.  Winter  grain  needs  about  nine  months  to

mature. Between the time of sowing and harvesting the labor process

is almost entirely suspended [...]

    In all these cases therefore the production time of the advanced

capital consists of two periods: one period during which the capital is

engaged in the labor process and a second period during which its

form of existence — that of an unfinished product — is abandoned to

the sway of natural processes, without being at that time in the labor

process. Nor does it matter in the least here and there. The working

period and the production period do not coincide in these cases. Theproduction period is longer than the working period. But the product is

not finished, not ready, hence not fit to be converted from the form of

productive into that of commodity capital until the production period is

completed. Consequently, the length of the turnover period increases

in proportion to the length of the production time that does not consist

of  working  time.  In  so  far  as  the  production  time  in  excess  of  the

working time is not fixed by natural laws given once and for all, such

as govern the maturing of grain, the growth of an oak, etc., the period

of  turnover  can  often  be  more  or  less  shortened  by  an  artificial

reduction of the production time. Such instances are the introduction

of chemical bleaching instead of bleaching on the green and more

efficient drying apparatus [...]

    The  long  production  time  (which  comprises  a  relatively  small

period of working time) and the great length of the periods of turnover

entailed  make  forestry  an  industry  of  little  attraction  to  private  and

therefore capitalist enterprise [...]                        Chapter 12: The Time of Circulation



    All circumstances considered so far which distinguish the periods

of  turnover  of  different  capitals  invested  in  different  branches  of

industry  and  hence  also  the  periods  for  which  capital  must  be

advanced, originate in the process of production itself, such as the

difference between fixed and circulating capital, the difference in the

working periods, etc. But the time of turnover of capital is equal to the

sum of its production time plus its circulation, or rotation, time. It is

therefore a matter of course that a difference in the time of circulation

causes a difference in the time of turnover and hence in the length of

the  period  of  turnover.  This  becomes  more  evident  either  on

comparing  two  different  investments  of  capital  in  which  all

circumstances  modifying  the  turnover  are  equal  except  the  time  of

circulation, or on selecting a given capital with a given proportion of

fixed and circulating capital, a given working period, etc., with only the

times of circulation varying, hypothetically.

    One of the sections of the time of circulation — relatively the most

decisive  —  consists  of  the  time  of  selling,  the  period  during  which

capital exists in the state of commodity capital. The time of circulation,

and  hence  the  period  of  turnover  in  general,  are  long  or  short

depending  on  the  relative  length  of  this  selling  time.  An  additional

outlay of capital may become necessary as a result of expenses of

storage, etc.

    [...]  The  improvement  of  the  means  of  communication  and

transportation  cuts  down  absolutely  the  wandering  period  of  the

commodities [...] Whereas on the one hand the improvement of the

means  of  transportation  and  communication  brought  about  by  the

progress  of  capitalist  production  reduces  the  time  of  circulation  of

particular  quantities  of  commodities,  the  same  progress  and  the

opportunities  created  by  the  development  of  transport  and

communication  facilities  make  it  imperative,  conversely,  to  work  for

ever more remote markets, in a word — for the world market. Themass of commodities in transit for distant places grows enormously,

and with it therefore grows, both absolutely and relatively, that part of

social capital which remains continually for long periods in the stage of

commodity  capital,  within  the  time  of  circulation.  There  is  a

simultaneous growth of that portion of social wealth which, instead of

serving  as  direct  means  of  production,  is  invested  in  means  of

transportation  and  communication  and  in  the  fixed  and  circulating

capital required for their operation.

    The mere relative length of the transit of the commodities from

their place of production to their market produces a difference not only

in the first part of the circulation time, the selling time, but also in its

second part, the reconversion of the money into the elements of the

productive capital, the buying time. Suppose a commodity is shipped

to  India.  This  requires,  say,  four  months.  Let  us  assume  that  the

selling time is equal to zero, i.e., the commodities are made to order

and are paid for on delivery to the agent of the producer. The return of

the  money  (no  matter  in  what  form)  requires  another  four  months.

Thus  it  takes  altogether  eight  months  before  a  capital  can  again

function  as  productive  capital,  renew  the  same  operation.  The

differences in the turnover thus occasioned form one of the material

bases of the various terms of credit, just as overseas commerce in

general, for instance in Venice and Genoa, is one of the sources of

the credit system [...]

    Now let us take up the second stage of the time of circulation, the

buying time, or that period in which capital is reconverted from the

money form into the elements of productive capital. During this period

it must persist for a shorter or longer time in its condition of money

capital, hence a certain portion of the total capital advanced must all

the time be in the condition of money capital, although this portion

consists of constantly changing elements. For instance, of the total

capital  advanced  in  a  certain  business,  n  times  £100  must  be

available in the form of money capital, so that, while all the constituent

parts of these n times £100 are continually converted into productive

capital, this sum is nevertheless just as continually replenished by the

influx  from  the  circulation,  from  the  realized  commodity  capital.  A

definite part of the advanced capital value is therefore continually inthe condition of money capital, i.e., a form not pertaining to its sphere

of production but its sphere of circulation.

    We have already seen that the prolongation of the time for which

capital is fettered in the form of commodity capital on account of the

distance  of  the  market  results  in  direct  delay  of  the  return  of  the

money and consequently also the transformation of the capital from

money capital into productive capital.

    We have furthermore seen [...] with reference to the purchase of

commodities, that the time of buying, the greater or smaller distance

from  the  main  sources  of  the  raw  material,  makes  it  necessary  to

purchase raw material for a longer period and have it available in the

form of a productive supply, of latent or potential productive capital;

that in consequence it increases the amount of capital to be advanced

at one time [.]

    [An]  effect  is  produced  in  various  branches  of  business  by  the

more or less prolonged periods in which rather large quantities of raw

material  are  thrown  on  the  market.  In  London  for  example  great

auction sales of wool take place every three months, and the wool

market is controlled by them. The cotton market on the other hand is

on the whole restocked continuously, if not uniformly, from harvest to

harvest. Such periods determine the principal dates when these raw

materials are bought. Their effect is particularly great on speculative

purchases  necessitating  advances  for  longer  or  shorter  periods  for

these  elements  of  production,  just  as  the  nature  of  the  produced

commodities  acts  on  the  speculative,  intentional  withholding  of  a

product for a longer or shorter term in the form of potential commodity

capital [.]

    Apart from all speculation, the volume of the purchases of those

commodities which must always be available as a productive supply

depends  on  the  times  of  the  renewal  of  this  supply,  hence  on

circumstances which in their turn are dependent on market conditions

and which therefore are different for different raw materials. In these

cases,  money  must  be  advanced  from  time  to  time  in  rather  large

quantities and in lump sums. It returns more or less rapidly, but always

in instalments, according to the turnover of capital. One portion of it,

namely  the  part  reconverted  into  wages,  is  just  as  continually

expended again at short intervals. But another portion, namely thatwhich  is  to  be  reconverted  into  raw  material,  etc.,  must  be

accumulated  for  rather  long  periods,  as  a  reserve  fund  for  either

buying  or  paying.  Therefore,  it  exists  in  the  form  of  money  capital,

although the volume in which it exists as such, changes.

    We shall see in the next Chapter that other circumstances arising

either  from  the  process  of  production  or  that  of  circulation  make  it

necessary for a certain portion of the advanced capital to be available

in the form of money. In general it must be noted that the economists

are very prone to forget not only that a part of the capital required in a

business  passes  successively  through  the  three  stages  of  money

capital,  productive  capital,  and  commodity  capital,  but  also  that

different portions of it continuously and simultaneously possess these

forms, although the relative magnitudes of these portions vary all the

time [...]    Chapter 13: Effect of The Time of Turnover On the Magnitude

                              of Advanced Capital



    In this Chapter and in the next, the sixteenth, we deal with the

influence of the time of turnover on the self-expansion of capital.

    Take  the  commodity  capital  which  is  the  product  of  a  working

period of, say, nine weeks. Let us, for the time being, leave aside that

portion of the value of the product which is added to it by the average

wear and tear of the fixed capital, and also the surplus value added to

the product during the process of production. The value of this product

is  then  equal  to  that  of  the  circulating  capital,  advanced  for  its

production,  i.e.,  of  the  wages  and  the  raw  and  auxiliary  materials

consumed in its production. Let this value be £900, so that the weekly

outlay is £100. The period of production, which here coincides with the

working period, is therefore nine weeks. It is immaterial whether it is

assumed that this is the working period of a continuous product, or

whether it is a continuous working period for a discrete product, so

long as the quantity of discrete product brought to market at one time

costs nine weeks’ labor. Let the time of circulation be three weeks.

Then the entire period of turnover is twelve weeks. At the end of nine

weeks the advanced productive capital is converted into commodity

capital, but now it stays for three weeks in the period of circulation.

The  new  period  of  production  therefore  cannot  start  before  the

beginning  of  the  thirteenth  week,  and  production  would  be  at  a

standstill  for  three  weeks,  or  for  a  quarter  of  the  entire  period  of

turnover. It again does not make any difference whether it is assumed

that it takes so long on an average to sell the product, or that this

length of time is bound up with the remoteness of the market or the

terms of payment for the goods sold. Production would be standing

still for three weeks every three months, making it four times three, or

twelve weeks in a year, which means three months, or one-quarter, of

the annual period of turnover. Hence, if production is to be continuousand carried along the same scale week after week, there is only this

alternative:

    Either the scale of production must be reduced, so that the £900

suffice to keep the work going both during the working period and the

time of circulation of the first turnover, is then commenced with the

tenth week, before the first period of turnover is completed, for the

period  of  turnover  is  twelve  weeks,  and  the  working  period  nine

weeks. A sum of £900 distributed over twelve weeks makes £75 per

week.  It  is  evident  in  the  first  place  that  such  a  reduced  scale  of

business presupposes changed dimensions of the fixed capital and

therefore, on the whole, a curtailment of the business. In the second

place, it is questionable whether such a reduction can take place at

all,  for  in  each  business  there  exists,  commensurate  with  the

development of its production, a normal minimum of invested capital

essential to maintain its capacity to complete. This normal minimum

grows steadily with the advance of capitalist production, and hence it

is  not  fixed.  There  are  numerous  intermediate  grades  between  the

normal  minimum  existing  at  any  particular  time  and  the  ever

increasing  normal  maximum,  a  medium  which  permits  of  many

different scales of capital investment. Within the limits of this medium

reductions  may  take  place,  their  lowest  limit  being  the  prevailing

normal minimum.

    When  there  is  a  hitch  in  production,  when  the  markets  are

overstocked, and when raw materials rise in price, etc., the normal

outlay of circulating capital is restricted — once the pattern of the fixed

capital has been set — by cutting down working time to, say, one half.

On  the  other  hand,  in  times  of  prosperity,  the  pattern  of  the  fixed

capital given, there is an abnormal expansion of the circulating capital,

partly  through  the  extension  of  working  time  and  partly  through  its

intensification. In businesses which have, from the outset, to reckon

with such fluctuations, the situation is relieved partly by recourse to

the above measures and partly by employing simultaneously a greater

number  of  laborers,  in  combination  with  the  application  of  reserve

fixed capital, such as reserve locomotives on railways, etc. However,

such  abnormal  fluctuations  are  not  considered  here,  where  we

assume normal conditions.    In  order  to  make  production  continuous,  therefore,  the

expenditure of the same circulating capital is here distributed over a

longer period, over twelve weeks instead of nine. In every section of

time there consequently functions a reduced productive capital. The

circulating portion of the productive capital is reduced from 100 to 75,

or  one-quarter.  The  total  amount  by  which  the  productive  capital

functioning for a working period of nine weeks is reduced equals 9

times 25, or £225, or one-quarter of £900. But the ratio of the time of

circulation to that of turnover is likewise three-twelfths, or one-quarter.

It follows therefore: circulation of the productive capital transformed

into commodity capital, if it is rather to be carried on simultaneously

and continuously week after week, and if no special circulating capital

is  available  for  this  purpose,  it  can  be  done  only  by  curtailing

productive operations, by reducing the circulating component of the

functioning productive capital. The portion of circulating capital thus

set  free  for  production  during  the  time  of  circulation  is  to  the  total

advanced circulating capital as the time of circulation is to the period

of turnover. This applies, as has already been stated, only to branches

of production in which the labor process is carried on in the same

scale week after week, where therefore no varying amounts of capital

are  to  be  invested  in  different  working  periods,  as  for  instance  in

agriculture.

    If on the other hand we assume that the nature of the business

excludes  a  reduction  of  the  scale  of  production,  and  thus  of  the

circulating  capital  to  be  advanced  each  week,  then  continuity  of

production can be secured only by additional circulating capital, in the

above-named case of £300. During the twelve-week turnover period,

£1,200 are successively invested, and £300 is one-quarter of this sum

as three weeks is of twelve. At the end of the working time of nine

weeks the capital value of £900 has been converted from the form of

productive  into  that  of  commodity  capital.  Its  working  period  is

concluded, but it cannot be re-opened with the same capital. During

the  three  weeks  in  which  it  stays  in  the  sphere  of  circulation,

functioning as commodity capital, it is in the same state, so far as the

process of production is concerned, as if it did not exist at all. We rule

out in the present case all credit relations and take for granted that the

capitalist operates only with his own money. But during the time thecapital  advanced  for  the  first  working  period,  having  completed  its

process of production, stays three weeks in the process of circulation,

there functions an additional capital investment of £300, so that the

continuity of production is not broken.

    Now, the following must be noted in this connection:

    Firstly: The working period of the capital of £900 first advanced is

completed at the close of nine weeks and it does not return until after

three weeks are up, that is to say, at the beginning of the thirteenth

week.  But  a  new  working  period  is  immediately  begun  with  the

additional capital of £300. By this means continuity of production is

maintained.

    Secondly: The functions of the original capital of £900 and of the

capital of £300 newly added at the close of the first nine-week working

period, inaugurating the second working period after the conclusion of

the  first  without  any  interruption,  are,  or  at  least  could  be,  clearly

distinguished  in  the  first  period  of  turnover,  while  they  cross  each

other each other in the course of the second period of turnover [...]

    In this entire section we have discussed only the turnovers of the

circulating capital, not those of the fixed, for the simple reason that the

question at issue has nothing to do with fixed capital. The instruments

of labor, etc., employed in the process of production form only fixed

capital, inasmuch as their time of employment exceeds the period of

turnover  of  the  circulating  capital;  inasmuch  as  the  period  of  time

during  which  these instruments  of  labor  continue  to  serve  in

perpetually  repeated  labor  processes  is  greater  than  the  period  of

turnover of the circulating capital, and hence equal to the n periods of

turnover of the circulating capital. Regardless of whether the total time

represented by these n periods of turnover of the circulating capital is

longer  or  shorter,  that  portion  of  the  productive  capital  which  was

advanced for this time in fixed capital is not advanced anew during its

course. It continues its functions in its old use form. The difference is

merely this:

    In proportion to the varying length of a single working period of

each period of turnover of the circulating capital, the fixed capital gives

up a greater or smaller part of its original value to the product of that

working  period,  and  proportionally  to  the  duration  of  the  circulation

time of each period of turnover this value-part of the fixed capital givenup to the product returns quicker or slower in money form. The nature

of the subject we are discussing in this section — the turnover of the

circulating portion of productive capital — derives from the very nature

of this portion. The circulating capital employed in a working period

cannot be applied in a new working period until it has completed its

turnover, until it has been transformed into commodity capital, from

that  into  money  capital,  and  from  that  back  into  productive  capital.

Hence,  in  order  that  the  first  working  period  may  be  immediately

followed by a second, capital must be advanced anew and converted

into  the  circulating  elements  of  productive  capital,  and  its  quantity

must be sufficient to fill the void occasioned by the circulation period of

the circulating capital advanced or the first working period. This is the

source of the influence exerted by the length of the working period of

the  circulating  capital  over  the  scale  of  the  labor  process  and  the

division  of  the  advanced  capital  or  the  addition  of  new  portions  of

capital. This was precisely what we had to examine in this section [.]

    From the preceding investigation it follows that

    A.  The  different  portions  into  which  capital  must  be  divided  in

order that one part of it may be continually in the working period while

others  are  in  the  period  of  circulation,  relieve  one  another,  like

different independent individual capitals, in two cases: (1) when the

working period is equal to the period of circulation, so that the period

of turnover is divided into two equal sections; (2) when the period of

circulation is longer than the working period, but at the same time is a

simple multiple of the working period, so that one period of circulation

is  equal  to  n  working  periods,  in  which  case  n  must  be  a  whole

number.  In  these  cases,  no  portion  of  the  successively  advanced

capital is set free.

    B.  On  the  other  hand  in  all  cases  in  which  (1)  the  period  of

circulation is longer than the working period without being a simple

multiple of it, and (2) in which the working period is longer than the

circulation period, a portion of the total circulating capital is set free

continually  and  periodically  at  the  close  of  each  working  period,

beginning with the second turnover. This freed capital is equal to that

portion of the total capital which has been advanced for the circulation

period,  provided  the  working  period  is  longer  than  the  period  of

circulation; and equal to that portion of the capital which has to fill upthe excess of the circulation period over the working period or over a

multiple of working periods, provided the circulation period is longer

than the working period.

    C.  It  follows  that  for  the  aggregate  social  capital,  so  far  as  its

circulating part is concerned, the release of capital must be the rule,

while  the  mere  alternation  of  portions  of  capital  functioning

successively in the production process must be the exception. For the

equality of the working and circulation periods, or the equality of the

period of circulation and a simple multiple of the working period, this

regular proportionality of the two components of the period of turnover

has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of the case and for this

reason it can occur on the whole only as a matter of exception.

    A very considerable portion of the social circulating capital, which

is turned over several times a year, will therefore periodically exist in

the form of released capital during the annual turnover cycle.

    It is furthermore evident that, all other circumstances being equal,

the magnitude of the released capital grows with the volume of the

labor  process  or  with  the  scale  of  production,  hence  with  the

development of capitalist production in general [...]                Chapter 14: The Turnover of Variable Capital



    I. The Annual Rate of Surplus Value


    [.] We shall apply the term capital A to the variable capital of £500,

which is turned over ten times per year, producing an annual surplus

value of £5,000 for which, therefore, the yearly rate of surplus value is

1,000%.

    Now let us assume that another variable capital, B, of £5,000, is

advanced for one whole year (i.e., here for 50 weeks), so that it is

turned over only once a year. We assume furthermore that at the end

of the year the product is paid for on the same day that it is finished,

so that the money capital, into which it is converted, returns on the

same day. The circulation period is then zero, the period of turnover

equals the working period, namely, one year. As in the preceding case

there is to be found in the labor process each week a variable capital

of £100, or of £5,000 in 50 weeks. Let the rate of surplus value be the

same, or 100%, i.e., let one half of the working day of the same length

consist of surplus labor. If we consider 5 weeks, the invested variable

capital  is  £500,  the  rate  of  surplus  value  100%  and  therefore  the

amount of surplus value produced in 5 weeks £500. The quantity of

labor power here exploited, and the intensity of its exploitation, are

assumed to be exactly the same as those of capital A.

    Each  week  the  invested  variable  capital  of  £100  produces  a

surplus value of £100, hence in 50 weeks the invested capital of 50 x

100  =  £5,000  produces  a  surplus  value  of  £5,000.  The  amount  of

surplus value produced annually is the same as in the previous case,

£5,000, but the yearly rate of surplus value is entirely different. It is

equal  to  the  surplus  value  produced  in  one  year  divided  by  the

advanced variable capital: 5,000s/5,000v, or 100%, while in the case

of capital A it was 1,000%.

    In the case of both capitals A and B, we have invested a variable

capital of £100 a week. The degree of self-expansion, or the rate ofsurplus value, is likewise the same, 100%, and so is the magnitude of

the  variable  capital,  £100.  The  same  quantity  of  labor  power  is

exploited,  the  volume  and  degree  of  exploitation  are  equal  in  both

cases,  the  working  days  are  the  same  and  equally  divided  into

necessary  labor  and  surplus  labor.  The  amount  of  variable  capital

employed in the course of the year is £5,000 in either case; it sets the

same amount of labor in motion, and extracts the same amount of

surplus value, £5,000, from the labor power set in motion by these two

equal  capitals.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  difference  of  900%  in  the

annual rate of surplus value of the two capitals A and B [...]

    The  variable  capital  advanced  for  a  definite  period  of  time  is

converted  into  employed,  hence  actually  functioning  and  operative

variable capital only to the extent that it really steps into the sections

of that period of time taken up by the labor process, to the extent that

it  really  functions  in  the  labor  process.  In  the  intermediate  time,  in

which a portion of it is advanced in order to be employed later, this

portion  is  practically  non-existent  for  the  labor  process  and  has

therefore no influence on the formation of either value or surplus value

[.]

    The  circumstances  which  differentiate  the  relation  between  the

advanced and the employed variable capital affect the production of

surplus value — the rate of surplus value being given — only to the

extent,  and  only  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  they  differentiate  the

quantity of variable capital which can be really employed in a stated

period of time, for instance in one week, 5 weeks, etc. The advanced

variable capital functions as variable capital only to the extent and only

during the time that it is actually employed, and not during the time in

which it remains in stock, is advanced, without being employed. But all

the  circumstances  which  differentiate  the  relation  between  the

advanced  and  the  employed  variable  capital  come  down  to  the

difference of the periods of turnover (determined by the difference of

either the working period, or the circulation period, or both). The law of

production of surplus value states that equal quantities of functioning

variable capital produce equal quantities of surplus value if the rate of

surplus value is the same. If then, equal quantities of variable capital

are employed by the capitals A and B in equal periods of time with

equal rates of surplus value, they must generate equal quantities ofsurplus value in equal periods of time, no matter how different the ratio

of this variable capital employed during a definite period of time to the

variable  capital  advanced  during  the  same  time,  and  no  matter

therefore  how  different  the  ratio  of  the  quantities  of  surplus  value

produced, not to the employed but to the advanced variable capital in

general. The difference of this ratio, far from contradicting the laws of

the production of surplus value that have been demonstrated, rather

corroborates them and is one of their inevitable consequences [...]

    The real rate of surplus value expresses nothing but the ratio of

the variable capital employed during a definite period to the surplus

value produced in the same time; or the quantity of unpaid labor set in

motion  by  the  variable  capital  employed  during  this  time.  It  has

absolutely nothing to do with that portion of the variable capital which

is advanced during the time in which it is not employed. Hence it has

likewise nothing to do with the ratio between that portion of capital

which is advanced during a definite period of time and that portion

which is employed during the same period of time — a ratio that is

modified and differentiated for different capitals by the turnover period.

    It  follows  rather  from  what  has  been  set  forth  above  that  the

annual rate of surplus value coincides only in one single case with the

real rate of surplus value which expresses the degree of exploitation

of labor; namely in the case when the advanced capital is turned over

only once a year and the capital advanced is thus equal to the capital

turned over in the course of the year, when therefore the ratio of the

quantity of the surplus value produced during the year to the capital

employed during the year in this production coincides and is identical

with the ratio of the quantity of surplus value produced during the year

to the capital advanced during the year.

    A) The annual rate of surplus value is equal to the (quantity of

surplus value produced during the year) / (variable capital advanced)

    But the quantity of the surplus value produced during the year is

equal to the real rate of surplus value multiplied by the variable capital

employed in its production. The capital employed in the production of

the annual quantity of surplus value is equal to the advanced capital

multiplied  by  the  number  of  its  turnovers,  which  we  shall  call  n.

Formula A is therefore transformed into the following:    B) The annual rate of surplus value is equal to the (real rate of

surplus  value  x  variable  capital  advanced  x  n)  /  (variable  capital

advanced)

    For instance, in the case of capital B = 100 x 5,000 x 1 / 5,000, or

100%. Only when n is equal to 1, that is, when the variable capital

advanced is turned over only once a year, and hence equal to the

capital  employed  or  turned  over  during  a  year,  the  annual  rate  of

surplus value is equal to its real rate.

    Let us call the annual rate of surplus value S', the real rate of

surplus  value  s',  the  advanced  variable  capital  v,  the  number  of

turnovers n. Then S' = s'vn/v = s'n. In other words, S' is equal to s'n,

and it is equal to s’ only when n = 1, and hence S’ = s’ times 1, or s’.

    It  follows  furthermore  that  the  annual  rate  of  surplus  value  is

always equal to s’n, i.e., to the real rate of surplus value produced in

one period of turnover by the variable capital consumed during that

period, multiplied by the number of turnovers of this variable capital

during  one  year,  or  (what  amounts  to  the  same)  multiplied  by  its

inverted  time  of  turnover  calculated  for  one  year.  (If  the  variable

capital is turned over ten times per year, then its time of turnover is

1/10 of a year; its inverted time of turnover therefore 10/1 or 10.)

    It  follows  furthermore  that  S’  =  s’  when  n  is  equal  to  1.  S’  is

greater  than  s’  when  n  is  greater  than  1;  i.e.,  when  the  advanced

capital is turned over more than once a year or the turned-over capital

is greater than the capital advanced.

    Finally, S’ is smaller than s’ when n is smaller than 1, that is, when

the capital turned over during the year is only a part of the advanced

capital, so that the period of turnover is longer than one year [...]



    II. The Turnover of the Variable Capital from The Social Point

of View


    Let us look at this matter for a moment from the point of view of

society. Let the wages of one laborer be £1 per week, the working day

10 hours. In case of A as well as B 100 laborers are employed during

a  year  (£100  for  100  laborers  per  week,  or  £500  for  5  weeks,  or

£5,000 for 50 weeks), and each one of them works 60 hours per weekof 6 days. So 100 laborers work 6,000 hours per week and 300,000

hours in 50 weeks. This labor power is taken hold of by A and B and

therefore cannot be expended by society for anything else. To this

extent the matter is the same socially with both A and B. Furthermore:

In the cases of both A and B the 100 laborers employed by either side

receive a yearly wage of £5,000 (or, together for the 200 laborers,

£10,000)  and  withdraw  from  society  means  of  subsistence  to  that

amount. So far the matter is therefore socially the same in the case of

both A and B. Since the laborers in either case are paid by the week,

they weekly withdraw their means of subsistence from society and, in

either case, throw a weekly equivalent in money into circulation. But

here the difference begins.

    First. The money which the A laborer throws into circulation is not

only, as it is for the B laborer, the money form of the value of his labor

power (in fact a means of payment for labor already performed); it is,

counting  from  the  second  turnover  period  after  the  opening  of  the

business, the money form of his own value (equal to the price of the

labor power plus the surplus value) created during the first period of

turnover,  by  which  his  labor  is  paid  during  the  second  period  of

turnover. This is not the case with the B laborer. As far as the latter is

concerned, the money is here, true enough, a medium of payment for

work already done by him, but this work done is not paid for with the

value which it itself produced and which was turned into money (not

with the money form of the value of the labor itself has produced). This

cannot be done until the beginning of the second year, when the B

laborer is paid with the value produced by him in the preceding year

and turned into money.

    The  shorter  the  period  of  turnover  of  capital  —  the  shorter

therefore the intervals at which it is reproduced throughout the year —

the quicker is the variable portion of the capital, originally advanced by

the capitalist in the form of money, transformed into the money form of

the value (including, besides, surplus value) created by the laborer to

replace this variable capital [... and] the greater comparatively is the

quantity  of  surplus  value  which  he  extracts  during  the  year  with  a

given rate of surplus value, because he can buy the laborer so much

more  frequently  with  the  money  form  of  the  value  created  by  that

laborer [.]    If the scale of production is given, the absolute magnitude of the

advanced  variable  money  capital  (and  of  the  circulating  capital  in

general)  decreases  proportionately  to  the  decrease  of  the  turnover

period,  while  the  annual  rate  of  surplus  value  increases.  If  the

magnitude of the advanced capital is given, the scale of production

grows;  hence,  if  the  rate  of  surplus  value  is  given,  the  absolute

quantity of surplus value created in one period of turnover likewise

grows, simultaneously with the rise in the annual rate of surplus value

effected by the shortening of the periods of reproduction. It generally

follows from the foregoing investigation that the different lengths of the

turnover periods make it necessary for money capital to be advanced

in very different amounts in order to set in motion the same quantity of

productive circulating capital and the same quantity of labor with the

same degree of exploitation of labor.

    Second — and this is interlinked with the first difference — the B

and A laborers pay for the means of subsistence which they buy with

the variable capital that has been transformed in their hands into a

medium of circulation. For instance, they not only withdraw wheat from

the market, but they also replace it with an equivalent in money. But

since  the  money  wherewith  the  B  laborer  pays  for  his  means  of

subsistence, which he withdraws from the market, is not the money

form of a value produced and thrown by him on the market during the

year, as it is in the case of the A laborer, he supplies the seller of the

means of subsistence with money, but not with commodities — be

they means of production or means of subsistence — which this seller

could buy with the proceeds of the sale, as he can in the case of A.

The market is therefore stripped of labor power, means of subsistence

for this labor power, fixed capital in the form of instruments of labor

used in the case of B, and of materials of production, and to replace

them an equivalent in money is thrown on the market; but during the

year no product is thrown on the market with which to replace the

material  elements  of  productive  capital  withdrawn  from  it.  If  we

conceive society as being not capitalist but communist, there will be

no money capital at all in the first place, not the disguises cloaking the

transactions arising on account of it.

    The question then comes down to the need of society to calculate

beforehand  how  much  labor,  means  of  production,  and  means  ofsubsistence it can invest, without detriment, in such lines of business

as  for  instance  the  building  of  railways,  which  do  not  furnish  any

means of production or subsistence, nor produce any useful effect for

a  long  time,  a  year  or  more,  while  they  extract  labor,  means  of

production and means of subsistence from the total annual production.

In capitalist society however where social reason always asserts itself

only post festum great disturbances may and must constantly occur.

On the one hand pressure is brought to bear on the money market,

while on the other, an easy money market calls such enterprises into

being en masse, thus creating the very circumstances which later give

rise to pressure on the money market. Pressure is brought to bear on

the  money  market,  since  large  advances  of  money  capital  are

constantly needed here for long periods of time. And this regardless of

the  fact  that  industrialists  and  merchants  throw  the  money  capital

necessary to carry on their business into speculative railway schemes;

etc., and make it good by borrowing in the money market.

    On  the  other  hand,  pressure  on  society’s  available  productive

capital.  Since  elements  of  productive  capital  are  forever  being

withdrawn from the market and only an equivalent in money is thrown

on the market in their place, the effective demand rises without itself

furnishing  any  element  of  supply.  Hence  a  rise  in  the  prices  of

productive materials as well as means of subsistence. To this must be

added that stock-jobbing is a regular practice and capital is transferred

on  a  large  scale.  A  band  of  speculators,  contractors,  engineers,

lawyers,  etc.,  enrich  themselves.  They  create  a  strong  demand  for

articles of consumption on the market, wages rising at the same time.

So far as foodstuffs are involved, agriculture too is stimulated. But as

these foodstuffs cannot be suddenly increased in the course of the

year, their import grows, just as that of exotic foods in general (coffee,

sugar, wine, etc.) and of articles of luxury. Hence excessive imports

and speculation in this line of the import business. Meanwhile, in those

branches  of  industry  in  which  production  can  be  rapidly  expanded

(manufacture proper, mining, etc.), climbing prices give rise to sudden

expansion soon followed by collapse. The same effect is produced in

the labor market, attracting great numbers of the latent relative surplus

population, and even of the employed laborers, to the new lines of

business.  In  general,  such  large-scale  undertakings  as  railwayswithdraw  a  definite  quantity  of  labor  power  from  the  labor  market,

which can come only from such lines of business as agriculture, etc.,

where only strong lads are needed. This still continues even after the

new enterprises have become established lines of business and the

migratory working class needed for them has already been formed, as

for instance in the case of temporary rise above the average in the

scale  of  railway  construction.  A  portion  of  the  reserve  army  of

laborers,  which  keep  wages  down,  is  absorbed.  A  general  rise  in

wages  ensues,  even  in  the  hitherto  well  employed  sections  of  the

labor market. This lasts until the inevitable crash again releases the

reserve army of labor and wages are once more depressed to their

minimum, and lower. [...]                Chapter 15: The Circulation of Surplus Value



    We  have  just  seen  that  a  difference  in  the  period  of  turnover

causes a difference in the annual rate of surplus value, even if the

mass of the annually produced surplus value is the same.

    But  there  are  furthermore  necessarily  differences  in  the

capitalization  of  surplus  value,  in  accumulation,  and  also  in  the

quantity of surplus value produced during the year, while the rate of

surplus value remains the same.

    To  begin  with,  we  note  that  capital  A  (in  the  illustration  of  the

preceding Chapter) has a current periodical revenue, so that with the

exception of the period of turnover inaugurating the business, it pays

for its own consumption within the year out of its production of surplus

value, and need not cover it by advances out of its own funds. But the

latter has to be done in the case of B. While it produces as much

surplus value in the same intervals of time as A, the surplus value is

not realized and therefore cannot be consumed either productively or

individually.  So  far  as  individual  consumption  is  concerned,  the

surplus  value  is  anticipated.  Funds  for  that  purpose  must  be

advanced.

    One portion of the productive capital, which it is difficult to classify

namely the additional capital required for the repair and maintenance

of the fixed capital, is now likewise seen in a new light.

    In the case of A, this portion of capital is not advanced — in full or

for the greater part — at the beginning of production. It need not be

available or even in existence. It comes out of the business itself by a

direct  transformation  of  surplus  value  into  capital,  i.e.,  by  its  direct

employment as capital. A part of the surplus value which is not only

periodically generated but also realized during the year can defray the

expenditures that must be incurred for repairs, etc. A portion of the

capital needed to carry on the business on its original scale is thus

produced in the course of business by the business itself by means of

capitalizing part of the surplus value. This is impossible for capital B.The portion of capital in question must in his case form a part of the

capital originally advanced. In both cases this portion will figure in the

books of the capitalists as an advanced capital, which it really is, since

according to our assumption it forms a part of the productive capital

required for maintaining the business on a certain scale. But it makes

all the difference in the world out of which funds it is advanced. In the

case of B, it is really a part of the capital to be originally advanced or

held available. In the case of A on the other hand it is a part of the

surplus value used as capital. This last case shows that not only the

accumulated  capital  but  also  a  portion  of  the  originally  advanced

capital may simply be capitalized surplus value.

    As  soon  as  the  development  of  credit  interferes,  the  relation

between  originally  advanced  capital  and  capitalized  surplus  value

becomes  still  more  complicated.  For  instance,  from  not  having

sufficient  capital  of  his  own  at  the  very  outset  for  this  purpose,  A

borrows from banker C a portion of the productive capital with which

he starts in business or continues it during the year. Banker C lends

him a sum of money which consists only of surplus value deposited

with the banker by capitalists D, E, F, etc. As far as A is concerned

there is as yet no question of accumulated capital. But with regard to

D, E, F, etc., A is, in fact, nothing but an agent capitalizing surplus

value appropriated by them [...]

    Along with the real accumulation or conversion of surplus value

into  productive  capital  (and  a  corresponding  reproduction  on  an

extended scale), there is, then, an accumulation of money, a raking

together of a portion of the surplus value in the form of latent money

capital, which is not intended to function as additional active capital

until later, when it swells to a certain volume.

    That is how the matter looks from the standpoint of the individual

capitalist.  But  simultaneously  with  the  development  of  capitalist

production the credit system also develops. The money capital which

the capitalist cannot as yet employ in his own business is employed by

others, who pay him interest for its use. It serves him as money capital

in  its  specific  meaning,  as  a  kind  of  capital  distinguished  from

productive capital. But it serves as capital in another’s hands [...]

    For reproduction only two normal cases are possible, apart from

disturbances, which interfere with reproduction even on a fixed scale.    There is either reproduction on a simple scale.

    Or there is capitalization of surplus value, accumulation.



    I. Simple Reproduction


    In the case of simple reproduction, the surplus value produced

and realized annually, or periodically, if there are several turnovers

during  the  year,  is  consumed  individually,  that  is  to  say,

unproductively, by its owner, the capitalist [.]

    Even if simple reproduction is assumed, a portion of the surplus

value must therefore always exist in the form of money and not of

products, because otherwise it could not be converted for purposes of

consumption from money into products. This conversion of the surplus

value  from  its  original  commodity  form  into  money  must  be  further

analyzed  at  this  place.  In  order  to  simplify  the  matter,  we  shall

presuppose  the  most  elementary  form  of  the  problem,  namely  the

exclusive  circulation  of  metal  coin,  of  money  which  is  a  real

equivalent.

    According to the laws of the simple circulation of commodities [...,]

the  mass  of  the  metal  coin  existing  in  a  country  must  not  only  be

sufficient to circulate the commodities, but must also suffice to meet

the currency fluctuations, which arise partly from fluctuations in the

velocity  of  the  circulation,  partly  from  a  change  in  the  prices  of

commodities, partly from the various and varying proportions in which

the  money  functions  as  a  medium  of  payment  or  as  a  medium  of

circulation  proper.  The  proportion  in  which  the  existing  quantity  of

money is split into a hoard and money in circulation varies continually,

but  the  total  quantity  of  money  is  always  equal  to  the  sum  of  the

money  hoarded  and  the  money  circulating.  This  quantity  of  money

(quantity  of  precious  metal)  is  a  gradually  accumulated  hoard  of

society. Since a portion of this hoard is consumed by wear and tear, it

must be replaced annually, the same as any other product. This takes

place in reality by a direct or indirect exchange of a part of the annual

product of a particular country for the product of countries producing

gold and silver. However, this international character of the transaction

conceals  its  simple  course.  In  order  to  reduce  the  problem  to  itssimplest  and  most  lucid  expression,  it  must  be  assumed  that  the

production  of  gold  and  silver  takes  place  in  that  particular  country

itself, that therefore the production of gold and silver constitutes a part

of the total social production within every country.

    Apart from the gold and silver produced for articles of luxury, the

minimum  of  their  annual  production  must  be  equal  to  the  wear  of

metal  coin  annually  occasioned  by  the  circulation  of  money.

Furthermore, if the sum of the values of the annually produced and

circulating quantity of commodities increases, the annual production of

gold  and  silver  must  likewise  increase,  inasmuch  as  the  increased

sum  of  values  of  the  circulating  commodities  and  the  quantity  of

money required for their circulation (and the corresponding formation

of  a  hoard)  are  not  made  good  by  a  greater  velocity  of  money

currency and a more comprehensive function of money as a medium

of payment, i.e., by a greater mutual balancing of purchases and sales

without the intervention of actual money.

    A  portion  of  the  social  labor  power  and  a  portion  of  the  social

means  of  production  must  therefore  be  expended  annually  in  the

production of gold and silver.

    The capitalists who are engaged in the production of gold and

silver and who, according to our assumption of simple reproduction,

carry on their production only within the bounds of the annual average

wear and tear and the annual average consumption of gold and silver

entailed  thereby  throw  their  surplus  value  —  which  they  consume

annually, according to our assumption, without capitalizing any of it —

directly into circulation in the money form, which is its natural form;

unlike the other branches of production, where it is the converted form

of the product.

    Furthermore, as far as wages are concerned — the money form in

which the variable capital is advanced — they are also not replaced by

the sale of the product, by its conversion into money, but by a product

itself whose natural form is from the outset that of money.

    Finally,  the  same  applies  also  to  that  portion  of  the  product  of

precious  metals  which  is  equal  to  the  value  of  the  periodically

consumed constant capital, both the constant circulating and constant

fixed capital consumed during the year [...]    If  we  consider  at  first  only  the  circulating  portion  of  capital

advanced in M, the starting-point of M — C ... P ... M’, we find that a

certain  sum  of  money  is  advanced,  thrown  into  circulation  for  the

payment of labor power and the purchase of materials of production.

But this sum is not withdrawn from circulation by the circuit of this

capital, in order to be thrown into it anew. The product is money even

in its bodily form; there is no need therefore of transforming it into

money by means of exchange, by a process of circulation. It passes

from the process of production into the sphere of circulation, not in the

form  of  commodity  capital  which  has  to  be  reconverted  in  money

capital,  but  as  money  capital  which  is  to  be  reconverted  into

productive capital, i.e., which is to buy fresh labor power and materials

of production. The money form of the circulating capital consumed in

labor power and means of production is replaced, not by the sale of

the product, but by the bodily form of the product itself; hence, not by

once more withdrawing its value from circulation in money form, but by

additional newly produced money.

    Let us suppose that this circulating capital is £500, the period of

turnover 5 weeks, the working period 4 weeks, the period of circulation

only  1  week.  From  the  outset,  money  for  5  weeks  must  be  partly

advanced for a productive supply, and partly be ready to be paid out

gradually in wages. At the beginning of the 6th week, £400 will have

returned  and  £100  will  have  been  released.  This  is  constantly

repeated. Here, as in previous cases, £100 will always be found in

released form during a certain time of the turnover. But they consist of

additional, newly produced, money, the same as the other £400. We

have  in  this  case  10  turnovers  per  year  and  the  annual  product  is

£5,000 in gold [...]

    In the case of every other capital of £500 turned over under the

same conditions, the ever renewed money form is the converted form

of the commodity capital produced and thrown into circulation every 4

weeks  and  which  by  its  sale  —  that  is  to  say,  by  a  periodical

withdrawal of the quantity of money it represented when it originally

entered into the process — assumes this money form anew over and

over  again.  Here,  on  the  contrary,  in  every  turnover  period  a  new

additional £500 in money is thrown from the process of productionitself into circulation, in order to withdraw from it continually materials

of production and labor power [.]

    Let the circulating capital of £500 advanced in the form of money

capital,  whatever  its  period  of  turnover,  now  stand  for  the  total

circulating  capital  of  society,  that  is,  of  the  capitalist  class.  Let  the

surplus value be £100. How can the entire capitalist class manage to

draw  continually  £600  out  of  circulation,  when  it  continually  throws

only £500 into it?

    After  the  money  capital  of  £500  has  been  converted  into

productive  capital,  the  latter  transforms  itself  within  the  process  of

production into commodities worth £600 and there are in circulation

not  only  commodities  valued  at  £500,  equal  to  the  money  capital

originally advanced, but also a newly produced surplus value of £100.

    This additional surplus value of £100 is thrown into circulation in

the form of commodities. No doubt about that. But such an operation

does not by any means furnish the additional money for the circulation

of this additional commodity value [...]

    The  capitalist  class  remains  consequently  the  sole  point  of

departure  of  the  circulation  of  money.  If  they  need  £400  for  the

payment of means of production and £100 for the payment of labor

power,  they  throw  £500  into  circulation.  But  the  surplus  value

incorporated in the product, with a rate of surplus value incorporated

in the product, with a rate of surplus value of 100%, is equal in value

to £100. How can they continually draw £600 out of circulation, when

they continually throw only £500 into it?

    [. Paradoxical] as it may appear at first sight, it is the capitalist

class itself that throws the money into circulation which serves for the

realization of the surplus value incorporated in the commodities. But,

nota bene, it does not throw it into circulation as advanced money,

hence  not  as  capital.  It  spends  it  as  a  means  of  purchase  for  its

individual consumption. The money is not therefore advanced by the

capitalist class, although it is the point of departure of its circulation.

    Let us take some individual capitalist who is starting in business, a

farmer for instance. During the first year, he advances a money capital

of, say, £5,000, paying £4,000 for means of production, and £1,000 for

labor power. Let the rate of surplus value be 100%, the amount of

surplus  value  appropriated  by  him  £1,000.  The  above  £5,000comprise all the money he advances as money capital. But the man

must also live, and he does not take in any money until the end of the

year. Take it that his consumption amounts to £1,000. These he must

have in his possession. He may say that he has to advance himself

these £1,000 during the first year. But this advance, which here has

only a subjective meaning, denotes nothing else but that he must pay

for  his  individual  consumption  during  the  first  year  out  of  his  own

pocket instead of defraying it out of the gratuitous production of his

laborers. He does not advance this money as capital. He spends it,

pays  it  out  for  an  equivalent  in  means  of  subsistence  which  he

consumes. This value has been spent by him in money, thrown into

circulation  and  withdrawn  from  it  in  the  form  of  commodity  values.

These commodity values he has consumed. He has thus ceased to

bear any relation to their value.

    The money with which he paid for this value exists now as an

element of the circulating money. But he has withdrawn the value of

this money from circulation in the form of products; and this value is

now destroyed together with the products in which it existed. It’s all

gone. But at the end of the year he throws commodities worth £6,000

into  circulation  and  sells  them.  By  this  means  he  recovers:  1)  his

advanced money capital of £5,000; 2) the realized surplus value of

£1,000.  He  has  advanced  as  capital,  has  thrown  into  circulation,

£5,000, and he withdraws from it £6,000 — £5,000 of which cover his

capital, and £1,000 his surplus value. The last £1,000 are turned into

money with the money which he himself has thrown into circulation,

which  he  did  not  advance,  but  spent  as  a  consumer,  not  as  a

capitalist. They now return to him as the money form of the surplus

value  produced  by  him.  And  henceforth  this  operation  is  repeated

every year. But beginning with the second year, the £1,000 which he

spends  are  constantly  the  converted  form,  the  money  form,  of  the

surplus value produced by him. He spends them annually and they

return to him annually.

    If his capital were turned over more frequently a year, it would not

alter this state of affairs, but would affect the length of time, and hence

the  amount  which  he  would  have  to  throw  into  circulation  for  his

individual consumption over and above his advanced money capital.    This  money  is  not  thrown  into  circulation  by  the  capitalist  as

capital. But it is a decided trait of the capitalist to be able to live on

means in his possession until surplus value begins to return.

    In the present case we assumed that the sum of money which the

capitalist throws into circulation to pay for his individual consumption

until the first returns of his capital is exactly equal to the surplus value

which he produced and hence must turn into money. This is obviously

an arbitrary assumption so far as the individual capitalist is concerned.

But it must be correct when applied to the entire capitalist class as

simple reproduction is assumed. It only expresses the same thing as

the assumption; namely, that the entire surplus value, and it alone —

hence  no  fraction  of  the  original  capital  stock  —  is  consumed

unproductively [...]



    II. Accumulation and Reproduction on an Extended Scale


    Since  accumulation  takes  place  in  the  form  of  extended

reproduction, it is evident that it does not offer any new problem with

regard to money circulation.

    In the first place, as far as the additional money capital required

for the functioning of the increasing productive capital is concerned,

that is supplied by the portion of the realized surplus value thrown into

circulation by the capitalists as money capital, not as the money form

of the revenue. The money is already in the hands of the capitalists.

Only its employment is different.

    Now however in consequence of the additional productive capital,

its  product,  an  additional  mass  of  commodities  is  thrown  into

circulation.  Together  with  this  additional  quantity  of  commodities,  a

part of the additional money needed for its realization is thrown into

circulation,  inasmuch  as  the  value  of  this  mass  of  commodities  is

equal to that of the productive capital consumed in their production.

This  additional  amount  of  money  has  been  advanced  precisely  as

additional  money  capital,  and  therefore  returns  to  the  capitalist

through the turnover of his capital. Here the same question as above

re-appears. Where does the additional money come from with whichto realize the additional surplus value now contained in the form of

commodities?

    The general reply is again the same. The sum total of the prices

of the circulating commodities has been increased, not because the

prices of a given quantity of commodities have risen, but because the

mass  of  commodities  now  circulating  is  greater  than  that  of  the

previously circulating commodities, without it being offset by a fall in

prices. The additional money required for the circulation of this greater

quantity of commodities of greater value must be secured either by

greater economy in the use of the circulating quantity of money —

whether  by  balancing  the  payments,  etc.,  by  measures  which

accelerate  the  circulation  of  the  same  coins  —  or  by  the

transformation  of  money  from  the  form  of  a  hoard  into  that  of  a

circulating  medium.  The  latter  does  not  only  imply  that  idle  money

capital begins to function as a means of purchase or payment, or that

money capital already functioning as a reserve fund while performing

this function for its owner, actively circulates for society (as is the case

with  bank  deposits  which  are  continually  lent),  thus  performing  a

double function. It also implies that the stagnating reserve funds of

coins are economized.

    “In order that money should flow continuously as coin, coin must

constantly  coagulate  as  money.  The  continual  currency  of  coin

depends on its continual stagnation, in greater or smaller quantities, in

reserve  funds  of  coin  which  spring  up  throughout  the  sphere  of

circulation  and  also  necessitate  it;  the  formation,  distribution,

dissolution,  and  re-formation  of  these  reserve  funds  are  constantly

alternating, their existence constantly disappears, their disappearance

constantly  exists.  Adam  Smith  expressed  this  never-ceasing

transformation of coin into money and of money into coin by saying

that every owner of commodities must always keep in supply, aside

from the particular commodity which he sells, a certain quantity of the

universal  commodity  with  which  he  buys.  We  saw  that  in  the

circulation  C  —  M  —  C  the  second  member  M  —  C  splits  up

constantly into a series of purchases which do not take place at once

but at successive intervals of time, so that one part of M is current as

coin while the other rests as money. As a matter of fact, money is in

that case only suspended coin and the separate parts of the currentmass of coins continuously appear now in the one form, and now in

the  other,  alternating  constantly.  This  first  transformation  of  the

medium of circulation into money represents, therefore, but a technical

aspect  of  money  circulation  itself”.  (Karl  Marx,  Zur  Kritik  der

Politischen Oekonomie, 1859, pp. 105, 106.) (“Coin” as distinguished

from money is here employed to indicate money in its function of a

mere medium of circulation in contrast with its other functions.)

    When all these measures do not suffice, additional gold must be

produced,  or,  what  amounts  to  the  same,  a  part  of  the  additional

product exchanged, directly or indirectly, for gold — the product of

countries in which precious metals are mined.

    The entire amount of labor power and social means of production

expended  in  the  annual  production  of  gold  and  silver  intended  as

instruments of circulation constitutes a bulky item of the faux frais of

the capitalist mode of production, of the production of commodities in

general.  It  is  an  equivalent  abstraction  from  social  utilization  of  as

many additional means of production and consumption as possible,

i.e.,  of  real  wealth.  To  the  extent  that  the  costs  of  this  expensive

machinery of circulation are decreased, the given scale of production

or the given degree of its extension remaining constant, the productive

power  of  social  labor  is eo  ipso  increased.  Hence,  so  far  as  the

expediencies developing with the credit system have this effect, they

increase capitalist wealth directly, either by performing a large portion

of the social production and labor power without any intervention of

real  money,  or  by  raising  the  functional  capacity  of  the  quantity  of

money really functioning.

    This  disposes  also  of  the  absurd  question  whether  capitalist

production in its present volume would be possible without the credit

system (even if regarded only from this point of view), that is, with the

circulation  of  metallic  coin  alone.  Evidently  this  is  not  the  case.  It

would rather have encountered barriers in the volume of production of

precious  metals.  On  the  other  hand,  one  must  not  entertain  any

fantastic illusions on the productive power of the credit system, so far

as it supplies or sets in motion money capital. A further analysis of this

question is out of place here.      PART 3: THE REPRODUCTION AND CIRCULATION

            OF THE AGGREGATE SOCIAL CAPITAL                              Chapter 16: Introduction



    I. The Subject Investigated


    The direct process of the production of capital is its labor and self-

expansion  process,  the  process  whose  result  is  the  commodity

product  and  whose  compelling  motive  is  the  production  of  surplus

value.

    The  process  of  reproduction  of  capital  comprises  this  direct

process  of  production  as  well  as  the  two  phases  of  the  circulation

process proper, i.e., the entire circuit which, as a periodic process — a

process  which  constantly  repeats  itself  in  definite  periods  —

constitutes the turnover of capital.

    Whether we study the circuit in the form of M ... M’ or that of P ...

P, the direct process of production P itself always forms but one link in

this circuit. In the one form it appears as a promoter of the process of

circulation;  in  the  other  the  process  of  circulation  appears  as  its

promoter.  Its  continuous  renewal,  the  continuous  re-appearance  of

capital  as  productive  capital,  is  in  either  case  determined  by  its

transformations in the process of circulation. On the other hand, the

continuously  renewed  process  of  production  is  the  condition  of  the

transformations which the capital undergoes ever anew in the sphere

of  circulation,  of  its  alternate  appearance  as  money  capital  and

commodity capital.

    Every  individual  capital  forms,  however,  but  an  individualized

fraction,  a  fraction  endowed  with  individual  life,  as  it  were,  of  the

aggregate social capital, just as every individual capitalist is but an

individual element of the capitalist class. The movement of the social

capital consists of the totality of the movements of its individualized

fractional parts, the turnovers of the individual capitals. Just as the

metamorphosis of the individual commodity is a link in the series of

metamorphoses  of  the  commodity  world  —  the circulation  of

commodities  —  so  the  metamorphosis  of  the  individual  capital,  its

turnover, is a link in the circuit described by social capital.    This  total  process  comprises  both  the  productive  consumption

(the  direct  process  of  production)  together  with  the  conversions  of

form (materially considered, exchanges) which bring it about, and the

individual  consumption  together  with  the  conversions  of  form  or

exchanges by which it is brought about. It includes on the one hand

the conversion of variable capital into labor power, and therefore the

incorporation of labor power in the process of capitalist production.

Here the laborer acts as the seller of his commodity, labor power, and

the  capitalist  as  its  buyer.  But  on  the  other  hand  the  sale  of  the

commodities  embraces  also  their  purchase  by  the  working  class,

hence their individual consumption. Here the working class appears

as buyer and the capitalists as sellers of commodities to the laborers.

    The circulation of the commodity capital includes the circulation of

surplus  value,  hence  also  the  purchases  and  sales  by  which  the

capitalist  effect  their  individual  consumption,  the  consumption  of

surplus value.

    The circuit of the individual capitals in their aggregate as social

capital,  hence  considered  in  its  totality,  comprises  not  only  the

circulation of capital but also the general circulation of commodities.

The latter can originally consist of only two components: 1) The circuit

of capital proper and 2) the circuit of the commodities which enter into

individual consumption, consequently of the commodities for which the

laborer expends his wages and the capitalist his surplus value (or a

part  of  it).  At  any  rate,  the  circuit  of  capital  comprises  also  the

circulation  of  the  surplus  value,  since  the  latter  is  a  part  of  the

commodity capital, and likewise the conversion of the variable capital

into labor power, the payment of wages. But the expenditure of this

surplus value and wages for commodities does not form a link in the

circulation  of  capital,  although  at  least  the  expenditure  of  wages  is

essential for this circulation.

    In Book I the process of capitalist production was analyzed as an

individual act as well as a process of reproduction: the production of

surplus value and the production of capital itself. The changes of form

and substance experienced by capital in the sphere of circulation were

assumed without dwelling upon them. It was presupposed that on the

one hand the capitalist sells the product at its value and on the other

that he finds within the sphere of circulation the objective means ofproduction for restarting or continuing the process. The only act within

the sphere of circulation on which we have dwelt was the purchase

and  sale  of  labor  power  as  the  fundamental  condition  of  capitalist

production.

    In the first part of this Book II, the various forms were considered

which  capital  assumes  in  its  circuit,  and  the  various  forms  of  this

circuit itself. The circulation time must now be added to the working

time discussed in Book I.

    In the second part, the circuit was studied as being periodic, i.e.,

as  a  turnover.  It  was  shown  on  the  one  hand  in  what  manner  the

various constituents of capital (fixed and circulating) accomplish the

circuit of forms in different periods of time and in different ways; on the

other hand, the circumstances were examined by which the different

lengths of the working period and circulation period are conditioned.

The  influence  was  shown  which  the  period  of  the  circuit  and  the

different proportions of its component parts exert upon the dimensions

of the production process itself and upon the annual rate of surplus

value. Indeed, while it was the successive forms continually assumed

and discarded by capital in its circuit that were studied in Part I, it was

shown in Part II how a capital of a given magnitude is simultaneously,

though in varying proportions, divided, within this flow and succession

of forms, into different forms: productive capital, money capital, and

commodity capital, so that they not only alternate with one another,

but different portions of the total capital value are constantly side by

side and function in these different states. Especially money capital

came forward with distinctive features not shown in Book I. Certain

laws were found according to which diverse large components of a

given  capital  must  be  continually  advanced  and  renewed  —

depending on the conditions of the turnover — in the form of money

capital in order to keep a productive capital of a given size constantly

functioning.

    But in both the first and the second Parts it was always only a

question  of  some  individual  capital,  of  the  movement  of  some

individualized part of social capital.

    However,  the  circuits  of  the  individual  capitals  intertwine,

presuppose and necessitate one another, and form, precisely in this

interlacing,  the  movement  of  the  total  social  capital.  Just  as  in  thesimple circulation  of  commodities  the  total  metamorphosis  of  a

commodity appeared as a link in the series of metamorphoses of the

world  of  commodities,  so  now  the  metamorphosis  of  the  individual

capital appears as a link in the series of metamorphoses of the social

capital.  But  while  simple  commodity  circulation  by  no  means

necessarily comprises the circulation of capital — since it may take

place  on  the  basis  of  non-capitalist  production  —  the  circuit  of  the

aggregate social capital, as was noted, comprises also the commodity

circulation  lying  outside  the  circuit  of  individual  capital,  i.e.,  the

circulation of commodities which do not represent capital.

    We  have  now  to  study  the  process  of  circulation  (which  in  its

entirety  is  a  form  of  the  process  of  reproduction)  of  the  individual

capitals as components of the aggregate social capital, that is to say,

the process of circulation of this aggregate social capital.



    II. The Role of Money Capital


    In the study of the turnover of the individual capital, money capital

revealed two aspects.

    In the first place it constitutes the form in which every individual

capital appears upon the scene and opens its process as capital. It

therefore appears as the primus motor, lending impetus to the entire

process.

    In the second place, that portion of the advanced capital value

which  must  be  continually  advanced  and  renewed  in  the  form  of

money  differs  in  its  ratio  to  the  productive  capital  which  it  sets  in

motion,  i.e.,  in  its  ratio  to  the  continuous  scale  of  production,

depending on the particular length of the period of turnover and the

particular ratio between its two component parts — the working period

and  the  period  of  circulation.  But  whatever  this  ratio  may  be,  the

portion of the capital value in process which can continually function

as  productive  capital  is  limited  in  any  event  by  that  portion  of  the

advanced capital value which must always exist beside the productive

capital in the form of money. It is here merely a question of the normal

turnover,  an  abstract  average.  Additional  money  capital  required  to

compensate for interruptions of the circulation is excepted.    [...]  Commodity  production  presupposes  commodity  circulation,

and  commodity  circulation  presupposes  the  expression  of

commodities  in  money,  the  circulation  of  money;  the  splitting  of  a

commodity into commodity and money is a law of the expression of

the  product  as  a  commodity.  Similarly,  the  capitalist  production  of

commodities  —  whether  considered  socially  or  individually  —

presupposes capital in the form of money, or money capital, both as

the  primus  motor  of  every  incipient  business,  and  as  its  continual

motor. The circulating capital especially implies that the money capital

acts with constant repetition at short intervals as a motor. The entire

advanced  capital  value,  that  is  to  say,  all  the  elements  of  capital,

consisting  of  commodities,  labor  power, instruments  of  labor,  and

materials  of  production,  must  be  bought  over  and  over  again  with

money. What is true here of the individual capital is also true of the

social  capital,  which  functions  only  in  the  form  of  many  individual

capitals. But as we showed in Book I, it does not at all follow from this

that capitals field of operation, the scale of production, depends —

even on a capitalist basis — for its absolute limits on the amount of

functioning money capital.

    Incorporated  in  capital  are  elements  of  production  whose

expansion within certain limits is independent of the magnitude of the

advanced  money  capital.  Though  payment  of  labor  power  be  the

same, it can be exploited more or less extensively or intensively. If the

money  capital  is  increased  with  this  greater  exploitation  (that  is,  if

wages are raised), it is not increased proportionately, hence not at all

pro tanto.

    The productively exploited natural materials — the soil, the seas,

ores, forests, etc. — which do not constitute elements of capital value,

are more intensively or extensively exploited with a greater exertion of

the same amount of labor power, without an increased advance of

money  capital.  The  real  elements  of  productive  capital  are  thus

multiplied without requiring an additional money capital [...] The same

instruments of labor, and thus the same fixed capital, can be used

more effectively by an extension of the time they are daily used and by

a  greater  intensity  of  employment,  without  an  additional  outlay  of

money for fixed capital [...] The same is true of the social combination

of labor power in the process of production and of the accumulatedskill of the individual laborers [...] True enough, the increase in the

productive power of labor, so far as it does not imply an additional

investment  of  capital  value,  augments  in  the  first  instance  only  the

quantity  of  the  product,  not  its  value,  except  insofar  as  it  makes  it

possible to reproduce more constant capital with the same labor and

thus to preserve its value. But it forms at the same time new material

for capital, hence the basis of increased accumulation of capital [...]

    Finally, we have shown in the preceding Part that a shortening of

the  period  of  turnover  permits  of  setting  in  motion  either  the  same

productive capital with less money capital or more productive capital

with the same money capital.

    But evidently all this has nothing to do with the question of money

capital itself. It shows only that the advanced capital — a given sum of

values consisting in its free form, in its value form, of a certain sum of

money  —  includes,  after  its  conversion  into  productive  capital,

productive powers whose limits are not set by the limits of its value,

but  which  on  the  contrary  may  operate  within  certain  bounds  with

differing degrees of extensiveness or intensiveness. If the prices of the

elements of production — the means of production and labor power —

are  given,  the  magnitude  of  the  money  capital  required  for  the

purchase  of  a  definite  quantity  of  these  elements  of  production

existing as commodities is determined. Or the magnitude of value of

the capital to be advanced is determined. But the extent to which this

capital acts as a creator of values and products is elastic and variable

[...]

    Inasmuch as the period of turnover is determined by the length of

the working period, it is determined, other conditions remaining equal,

by the material nature of the process of production, hence not by the

specific social character of this process of production. However, on

the  basis  of  capitalist  production,  more  extensive  operations  of

comparatively  long  duration  necessitate  large  advances  of  money

capital  for  a  rather  long  time.  Production  in  such  spheres  depends

therefore on the magnitude of the money capital which the individual

capitalist has at his disposal. This barrier is broken down by the credit

system  and  the  associations  connected  with  it,  e.g.,  the  stock

companies.  Disturbances  in  the  money  market  therefore  put  suchestablishments out of business, while these same establishments, in

their turn, produce disturbances in the money market [.]

    We see that inasmuch as the need for money capital originates in

the length of the working period, it is conditioned by two things: First,

that  money  in  general  is  the  form  in  which  every  individual  capital

(apart from credit) must make its appearance in order to transform

itself into productive capital; this follows from the nature of capitalist

production  and  commodity  production  in  general.  Second,  the

magnitude of the required money advance is due to the circumstance

that labor power and means of production are continually withdrawn

from  society  for  a  comparatively  long  time  without  any  return  to  it,

during  that  period,  of  products  convertible  into  money.  The  first

condition, that the capital to be advanced must be advanced in the

form  of  money,  is  not  eliminated  by  the  form  of  this  money  itself,

whether  it  is  metal-money,  credit  money,  token-money,  etc.  The

second condition is in no way affected by what money medium or in

what form of production labor, means of subsistence, and means of

production are withdrawn without the return of some equivalent to the

circulation                        Chapter 17: Simple Reproduction



    [...]



    II. The Two Departments of Social Production


    The total product, and therefore the total production, of society

may be divided into two major departments:

    I. Means of Production, commodities having a form in which they

must, or at least may, pass into productive consumption.

    II. Articles of Consumption, commodities having a form in which

they  pass  into  the  individual  consumption  of  the  capitalist  and  the

working class [...]

    In each department the capital consists of two parts:

    1) Variable Capital. This capital, so far as its value is concerned,

is equal to the value of the social labor power employed in this branch

of production; in other words, it is equal to the sum of the wages paid

for this labor power. So far as its substance is concerned, it consists of

the labor power in action, i.e., of the living labor set in motion by this

capital value.

    2)  Constant  Capital.  This  is  the  value  of  all  the  means  of

production employed for productive purposes in this branch. These,

again, are divided into fixed capital, such as machines, instruments of

labor,  buildings,  laboring  animals,  etc.,  and  circulating  constant

capital, such as materials of production: raw and auxiliary materials,

semi-finished products, etc. [...]

    We shall base our study of simple reproduction on the following

scheme, in which c stands for constant capital, v for variable capital,

and s for surplus value, assuming the rate of surplus value s/v to be

100 per cent. The figures may indicate millions of marks, francs, or

pounds sterling.

    I. Production of Means of Production:        Capital..............4,000c + 1,000v = 5,000

    Commodity Product4,000c + 1,000v, + 1,000s =6,000,

    existing in means of production.

 

    II. Production of Articles of Consumption:

    Capital............. 2,000c + 500v = 2,500

    Commodity Product. 2,000c + 500v + 500s =3,000,

    existing in articles of consumption.

 

      Recapitulation: Total annual commodity product:

    I. 4,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s = 6,000 means of production

    II. 2,000c + 500v + 500s = 3,000 articles of consumption

    Total value 9,000, exclusive of the fixed capital persisting in its

natural form, according to our assumption.

 

    If we were now to examine the transformations necessary on the

basis  of  simple  reproduction,  where  the  entire  surplus  value  is

unproductively consumed, and leave aside for the present the money

circulation that brings them about, we should obtain at the outset three

great points of support.

    1)  The  500v,  representing  wages  of  the  laborers,  and  500s,

representing surplus value of the capitalists, in department II, must be

spent for articles of consumption. But their value exists in articles of

consumption  worth  1,000,  held  by  the  capitalists  of  department  II,

which  replace  the  advanced  500v  and  represent  the  500s.

Consequently,  the  wages  and  surplus  value  of  department  II  are

exchanged  within  this  department  for  products  of  this  same

department. Thereby articles of consumption to the amount of (500v +

500s) II = 1,000, drop out of the total product.

    2) The 1,000v plus 1,000s of department I must likewise be spent

for articles of consumption; in other words, for products of department

II. Hence they must be exchanged for the remainder of this product

equal to the constant capital part, 2,000c. Department II receives in

return an equal quantity of means of production, the product of I, in

which the value of 1,000v + 1,000s of I is incorporated. Thereby 2,000

IIc and (1,000v +1,000s) I drop out of the calculation.    3)  There  still  remain  4,000  Ic.  These  consist  of  means  of

production  which  can  be  used  only  in  department  I  to  replace  its

consumed constant capital, and are therefore disposed of by mutual

exchange between the individual capitalists of I, just as the (500v +

500s)  II  by  an  exchange  between  the  laborers  and  capitalists,  or

between the individual capitalists of II.

    Let this serve for the moment to facilitate the understanding of

what follows.



    III. Exchange Between the Two Departments I(V + S) VERSUS

IIC


    We  begin  with  the  great  exchange  between  the  two  classes.

(1,000v + 1,000s) I — these values consisting, in the hands of their

producers,  of  means  of  production  in  their  natural  form,  are

exchanged  for  2,000  II  c,  for  values  consisting  of  articles  of

consumption  in  their  bodily  form.  The  capitalist  class  of  II  thereby

reconverts  its  constant  capital  of  2,000  from  the  form  of  articles  of

consumption  into  that  of  means  of  production  of  articles  of

consumption,  into  a  form  in  which  it  can  once  more  function  as  a

factor of the labor process and for purposes of self-expansion of value

as constant capital value. On the other hand, the equivalent of the

labor power of I (1,000v) and the surplus value of the capitalists of I

(1,000s) are realized thereby in articles of consumption; both of them

are  converted  from  their  bodily  form  of  means  of  production  into  a

bodily form in which they can be consumed as revenue.

    Now,  this  mutual  exchange  is  accomplished  by  means  of  a

circulation of money, which promotes it just as much as it renders its

understanding difficult, but which is of decisive importance because

the variable portion of capital must ever resume the form of money, as

money  capital  converting  itself  from  the  form  of  money  into  labor

power. The variable capital must be advanced in the form of money in

all branches of production carried on at the entire periphery of society

simultaneously  alongside  each  other,  regardless  of  whether  they

belong to category I or II. The capitalist buys the labor power before it

enters into the process of production, but pays for it only at stipulatedtimes, after it has been expended in the production of use values. He

owns, together with the remainder of the value of the product, also

that portion of it which is only an equivalent for the money expended in

the payment of labor power, that portion of the value of the product

which represents variable capital. In this portion of value, the laborer

has already supplied the capitalist with the equivalent of his wages.

But it is the reconversion of commodities into money, their sale, which

restores  to  the  capitalist  his  variable  capital  in  the  form  of  money

capital, which he may advance once more for the purchase of labor

power.

    In department I, then, the aggregate capitalist has paid £1,000 (I

say £ solely to indicate that it is value in the form of money), equal to

1,000v, to the laborers for the value of product I already existing as

the v-portion, i.e., of the means of production created by them. With

these £1,000 the laborers buy articles of consumption of the same

value from capitalists II, thereby converting one half of the constant

capital II into money; capitalists II, in their turn, buy with these £1,000

means of production, valued at 1,000, from capitalists I; thereby, as far

as the latter are concerned, the variable capital value equal to 1,000v,

which, being part of their product, existed in the bodily form of means

of production, is thus reconverted into money and can now function

anew  in  the  hands  of  capitalists  I  as  money  capital,  which  is

transformed into labor power, hence into the most essential element of

productive capital. In this way their variable capital flows back to them

in the form of money, as a result of the realization of some of their

commodity capital.

    As for the money required to exchange the s-portion of commodity

capital I for the second half of constant capital II, it may be advanced

in  various  ways.  In  reality  this  circulation  embraces  innumerable

separate  purchases  and  sales  by  the  individual  capitalists  of  both

categories,  the  money  coming  in  any  event  from  these  capitalists,

since we have already accounted for the money put into circulation by

the laborers. A capitalist of category II can buy, with the money capital

he  has  besides  his  productive  capital,  means  of  production  from

capitalists of category I, and, vice versa, a capitalist of category I can

buy,  with  money  funds  assigned  for  personal  and  not  for  capital

expenditure, articles of consumption from capitalists of category II. Acertain supply of money, to be used either for the advancement of

capital or for the expenditure of revenue must under all circumstances

be assumed to exist beside the productive capital in the hands of the

capitalists, as we have shown above in parts I and II. Let us assume

— the proportion is wholly immaterial for our purpose — that one half

of the money is advanced by capitalists II in the purchase of means of

production for the replacement of their constant capital, while the other

half is spent by capitalists I for articles of consumption. In that case

department II advances £500 for the purchase of means of production

from department I, thereby replacing (inclusive of the above £1,000

coming  from  the  laborers  of  department  I)  three-quarters  of  its

constant  capital in natura;  with  the  £500  so  obtained  department  I

buys articles of consumption from II, thereby completing for one half of

the s-portion of its commodity capital the circulation c — m — c, and

thus realizing its product in the consumption fund. By means of this

second process the £500 return to the hands of II as money capital

existing beside its productive capital.

    On the other hand, I expends money to the amount of £500 for

the purchase of II’s articles of consumption in anticipation of the sale

of that half of the s-portion of its commodity capital which is still lying

in  store  as  product.  With  the  same  £500  II  buys  from  I  means  of

production,  thereby  replacing in  natura  its  entire  constant  capital

(1,000 + 500 + 500 = 2,000), while I realizes its entire surplus value in

articles  of  consumption.  On  the  whole,  the  entire  exchange  of

commodities in the amount of £4,000 would be effected with a money

circulation of £2,000 which amount is attained only because the entire

annual product is described as exchanged in bulk, in a few large lots.

The  important  point  here  is  that  II  has  not  only  reconverted  its

constant capital reproduced in the form of articles of consumption, into

the form of means of production, but has besides recovered the £500

which it had advanced to the circulation for the purchase of means of

production; and that, similarly, I again possesses not only its variable

capital, which it had reproduced in the form of means of production, in

money  form,  as  money  capital  once  more  directly  convertible  into

labor power, but also the £500 expended in the purchase of articles of

consumption in anticipation of the sale of the s-portion of its capital.

These £500 flow back to it not because of the expenditure incurred,but because of the subsequent sale of a part of its commodity product

incorporating one half of its surplus value.

    In  both  cases  it  is  not  only  that  the  constant  capital  of  II  is

reconverted from the form of a product into the bodily form of means

of production, in which alone it can function as capital; and likewise it

is not only that the variable portion of the capital of I is converted into

its  money  form,  and  the  surplus  value  portion  of  the  means  of

production of I into its consumable form, the form in which it can be

used as revenue. It is also that the £500 of money capital, advanced

by  II  in  the  purchase  of  means  of  production  prior  to  selling  the

corresponding  compensating  portion  of  the  value  of  its  constant

capital — existing in the form of means of consumption — flow back to

II;  and  furthermore  back  to  I  flow  the  £500  which  were  expended

anticipando by it for the purchase of articles of consumption. If the

money advanced by II at the expense of the constant portion of its

commodity  product,  and  by  I  at  the  expense  of  the  surplus  value

portion  of  its  commodity  product,  flows  back  to  them,  this  is  solely

because the one class of capitalists throws £500 into circulation over

and above the constant capital existing in the form of commodities in

II, and the other class a like amount over and above the surplus value

existing in the form of commodities in I. In the last analysis the two

departments have mutually paid one another in full by the exchange of

equivalents in the shape of their respective commodities.

    The money thrown into circulation by them in excess of the values

of their commodities, as a means of effecting the exchange of these

commodities,  returns  to  each  one  of  them  out  of  the  circulation  in

proportion  to  the  quota  which  each  of  the  two  had  thrown  into

circulation. Neither has grown a farthing richer thereby. I possessed a

constant capital of 2,000 in the form of articles of consumption plus

500 in money; now it possesses 2,000 in means of production plus

500 in money, the same as before; in the same way I possesses, as

before, a surplus value of 1,000 (consisting of commodities, means of

production,  now  converted  into  a  consumption  fund)  plus  500  in

money.  The  general  conclusion  is  this:  Of  the  money  which  the

industrial  capitalists  throw  into  circulation  to  accomplish  their  own

commodity circulation, whether at the expense of the constant part of

the commodity value or at the expense of the surplus value existing inthe commodities to the extent that it is laid out as revenue, as much

returns into the hands of the respective capitalists as was advanced

by them for the money circulation.

    As for the reconversion of the variable capital of class I into the

form  of  money,  this  capital,  after  the  capitalists  of  I  invested  it  in

wages, exists for them first in the form of commodities in which the

laborers  delivered  it  to  them.  They  paid  this  capital  in  the  form  of

money  to  these  laborers  as  the  price  of  their  labor  power.  To  this

extent the capitalists have paid for that constituent part of the value of

their  commodity  product  which  is  equal  to  the  variable  capital

expended in the form of money. They are, for this reason, the owners

of this portion of the commodity product as well. But that part of the

working class which is employed by them does not buy the means of

production created by it; these laborers buy articles of consumption

produced by II. Hence the variable capital advanced by the capitalists

of I in the payment of labor power does not return to them directly. It

passes by means of purchases made by the laborers into the hands of

the capitalist producers of the commodities necessary for and within

the reach of working folks; in other words, it passes into the hands of

capitalists II. And not until these expend the money in the purchase of

means  of  production  does  it  return  by  this  circuitous  route  into  the

hands  of  capitalists  I.  It  follows  that,  on  the  basis  of  simple

reproduction, the sum of the values of v + s of the commodity capital

of  I  (and  therefore  a  corresponding  proportional  part  of  the  total

commodity product of I) must be equal to the constant capital II c,

which is likewise taken as a proportional part of the total commodity

product of department II; or I(v + s) = IIc.



    IV.  Exchange  Within  Department  Ii.  Necessities  of  Life  and

Articles of Luxury


    Of the value of the commodity product of department II there still

remain  to  be  studied  the  constituents  v  plus  s.  This  analysis  has

nothing to do with the most important question which occupies our

attention here, namely to what extent the division of the value of every

individual capitalist commodity product into c + v + s — even if broughtabout by different forms of appearance — applies also to the value of

the total annual product. This question finds its answers on the one

hand in the exchange of I (v + s) for IIc, and on the other hand in the

investigation, to be made later, of the reproduction of Ic in the annual

product  of  I.  Since  II(V  +  s)  exists  in  the  bodily  form  of  articles  of

consumption; since the variable capital advanced to the laborers in

payment of their labor power must generally speaking be spent by

them for articles of consumption; and since the s-portion of the value

of  commodities,  on  the  assumption  of  simple  reproduction,  is

practically  spent  as  revenue  for  articles  of  consumption,  it  is  prima

facie evident that the laborers II buy back, with the wages received

from the capitalists II, a portion of their own product, corresponding to

the amount of the money value received as wages.

    Thereby  the  capitalist  class  II  reconverts  the  money  capital

advanced by it in the payment of labor power into the form of money.

It is quite the same as if it had paid the laborers in mere value tokens.

As  soon  as  the  laborers  would  realize  these  value  tokens  by  the

purchase  of  a  part  of  the  commodities  produced  by  them  but

belonging to the capitalists, these tokens would return into the hands

of the capitalists. Only, these tokens do not merely represent value but

possess  it,  in  golden  or  silver  embodiment.  We  shall  analyses  in

greater detail later on this sort of reflux of variable capital advanced in

the form of money by means of a process in which the working class

appears as the purchaser and the capitalist class as the seller. Here

however  a  different  point  is  at  issue,  which  must  be  discussed  in

connection  with  this  return  of  the  variable  capital  to  its  point  of

departure.

    Category II of the annual production of commodities consists of a

great  variety  of  branches  of  production,  which  may,  however,  be

divided into two great sub-divisions by their products.

    a) Articles of consumption, which enter into the consumption of

the working class, and, to the extent that they are necessities of life —

even  if  frequently  different  in  quality  and  value  from  those  of  the

laborers — also form a portion of the consumption of the capitalist

class. For our purposes we may call this entire sub-division consumer

necessities, regardless of whether such a product as tobacco is reallya consumer necessity from the physiological point of view. It suffices

that it is habitually such.

    b) Articles of luxury, which enter into the consumption of only the

capitalist class and can therefore be exchanged only for spent surplus

value, which never falls to the share of the laborer.

    As  far  as  the  first  category  is  concerned  it  is  obvious  that  the

variable  capital  advanced  in  the  production  of  the  commodities

belonging in it must flow back in money form directly to that portion of

the capitalist class II (i.e., the capitalists Ila) who have produced these

necessities of life. They sell them to their own laborers to the amount

of the variable capital paid to them in wages. This reflux is direct so far

as  this  entire  sub-division  an  of  capitalist  class  I  is  concerned,  no

matter how numerous the transactions may be between the capitalists

of the various pertinent branches of industry, by means of which the

returning variable capital is distributed pro rata. These are processes

of circulation, whose means of circulation are supplied directly by the

money expended by the laborers. It is different, however, with sub-

division  IIb.  The  entire  portion  of  the  value  produced  in  this  sub-

division, IIb(V + s), exists in the bodily form of articles of luxury, i.e.,

articles  which  the  laboring  class  can  buy  no  more  than  it  can  buy

commodity  value  Iv  existing  in  the  form  of  means  of  production,

notwithstanding the fact that both the articles of luxury and the means

of production are the products of these laborers.

    Hence the reflux by which the variable capital advanced in this

subdivision returns to the capitalist producers in its money form cannot

be direct but must be mediated, as in the case of Iv.

    Let us assume for instance that v = 500 and s = 500, as they did

in the case of the entire class II; but that the variable capital and the

corresponding surplus value are distributed as follows:

    Sub-division  a,  Necessities  of  Life:  v  =  400;  s  =  400;  hence  a

quantity of commodities in consumer necessities of the value of 400v

+ 400s = 800, or IIa (400v + 400s).

    Sub-division b, Articles of Luxury: of the value of 100v + l00s =

200, or IIb (100v + 100s).

    The laborers of IIb have received 100 in money as payment for

their labor power, or say £100. With this money they buy articles of

consumption from capitalists IIa to the same amount. This class ofcapitalists  buys  with  the  same  money  £100  worth  of  the  IIb

commodities, and in this way the variable capital of capitalists IIb flows

back to them in the form of money.

    In IIa there are available once more 400v in money, in the hands

of  the  capitalists,  obtained  by  exchange  with  their  own  laborers.

Besides, a fourth of the part of the product representing surplus value

has been transferred to the laborers of IIb, and in exchange Ilb (100v)

have been received in the form of articles of luxury.

    Now,  assuming  that  the  capitalists  of  IIa  and  IIb  divide  the

expenditure  of  their  revenue  in  the  same  proportion  between

necessities  of  life  and  luxuries  —  three-fifths  for  necessities  for

instance and two-fifths for luxuries — the capitalists of sub-class IIa

will spend three-fifths of their revenue from surplus value, amounting

to 400s, or 240, for their own products, necessities of life, and two-

fifths, or 160, for articles of luxury. The capitalists of sub-class IIb will

divide their surplus value of 100 s in the same way: three-fifths, or 60,

for necessities, and two-fifths, or 40, for articles of luxury, the latter

being produced and exchanged in their own sub-class.

    The  160  in  articles  of  luxury  received  by  (IIa)  s  pass  into  the

hands of the IIa capitalists in the following manner: As we have seen,

100 of the (IIa) 400s were exchanged in the form of necessities of life

for an equal amount of (IIb)v, which exists as articles of luxury, and

another 60, consisting of necessities of life, for (IIb) 60s, consisting of

luxuries. The total calculation then stands as follows:

    IIa: 400v + 400s; IIb: 100v + 100s

    1) 400v (a) are consumed by the laborers of IIa, a part of whose

product (necessities of life) they form. The laborers buy them from the

capitalist  producers  of  their  own  sub-division.  These  capitalists

thereby recover £400 in money, which is the value of their variable

capital of 400 paid by them to these same laborers as wages. They

can now once more buy labor power with it.

    2) A part of the 400s (a), equal to the 100v (b), one-fourth of the

surplus  value  (a),  is  realized  in  luxuries  in  the  following  way:  The

laborers (b) received from the capitalists of their sub-division (b) £100

in wages. With this amount they buy one-fourth of the surplus value

(a), i.e., commodities consisting of necessities of life. With this money

the capitalists of (a) buy articles of luxury to the same amount, whichequals 100 v (b), or one half of the entire output of luxuries. In this way

the b capitalists get back their variable capital in the form of money

and are enabled to resume reproduction by again purchasing labor

power, since the entire constant capital of the whole category II has

already been replaced by the exchange of I (v + s) for IIc. The labor

power of the luxury workers is therefore saleable anew only because

the part of their own product created as an equivalent for their wages

is drawn by capitalists IIa into their consumption fund, is turned into

money. (The same applies to the sale of the labor power of I, since the

IIc for which I(v + s) is exchanged, consists of both articles of luxury

and necessities of life, and that which is renewed by means of I(v + s)

constitutes the means of production of both luxuries and necessities.)

    3)  We  now  come  to  the  exchange  between  a  and  b,  which  is

merely exchange between the capitalists of the two sub-divisions. So

far we have disposed of the variable capital (400v) and part of the

surplus value (100s) in a, and the variable capital (100v) in b. We

have  furthermore  assumed  that  the  average  proportion  of  the

expenditure of the capitalist revenue was in both classes two-fifths for

luxuries and three-fifths for necessities. Apart from the 100 already

expended for luxuries, the entire subdivision a still has to be allotted

60 for luxuries, and b has proportionately to be allotted 40.

    (lla)s is then divided into 240 for necessities and 160 for luxuries,

or 240 + 160 = 400s (IIa).

    (llb)s is divided into 60 for necessities and 40 for luxuries; 60 + 40

= 100s (IIb). The last 40 are consumed by this class out of its own

product  (two-fifths  of  its  surplus  value);  the  60  in  necessities  are

obtained by this class through the exchange of 60 of its surplus value

for 60s (a).

    We have, then, for the entire capitalist class II the following (v plus

s in sub-division a consisting of necessities, in b of luxuries): IIa (400v

+ 400s) + IIb (100v + 100s) = 1,000; by this movement there is thus

realized: 500v (a + b) // realized in 400v (a) and 100s (a) // + 500s (a +

b) // realized in 300s (a) + 100v (b) + 100s (b) // =1,000. For an and b,

each considered by itself, we obtain the following realization:

    a) v / (400v(a)) + s / (240s(a) + 100s(b) + 60s(b)) = 800

    b) v / (100s(a)) + s / (60s(a) + 40s(b)) ... = (200 / 1000)    If,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  we  assume  the  same  proportion

between the variable and constant capital (which, by the way, is not at

all necessary), we obtain for 400v (a) a constant capital of 1,600, and

for 100 v (b) a constant capital of 400. We then have the following two

subdivisions, an and b, in II:

    lla) 1,600c + 400v + 400s = 2,400

    llb) 400c + 100v + 100s = 600

 

    adding up to

    2,000c + 500v + 500s = 3,000

 

    Accordingly,  1,600  of  the  2,000  IIc  in  articles  of  consumption,

which are exchanged for 2,000 I(v + s), are exchanged for means of

production of necessities of life and 400 for means of production of

luxuries.

    The 2,000 I(v + s) would therefore break up into (800v + 800s) I

for a, equal to 1,600 means of production of necessities of life, and

(200v + 200s) I for b, equal to 400 means of production of luxuries.

    A considerable part of the instruments of labor as such, as well as

of  the  raw  and  auxiliary  materials,  etc.,  is  the  same  for  both

departments. But so far as the exchange of the various portions of

value of the total product I(v + s) is concerned, such a division would

be wholly immaterial. Both the above 800v of I and the 200v of I are

realized  because  the  wages  are  spent  for  articles  of  consumption

1,000  IIc;  hence  the  money  capital  advanced  for  this  purpose  is

distributed  evenly  on  its  return  among  the  capitalist  producers  of  I,

their advanced variable capital is replaced pro rata in money. On the

other hand, so far as the realization of the 1,000 Is is concerned, the

capitalists  will  here  likewise  draw  uniformly  (in  proportion  to  the

magnitude of their s) 600 IIa and 400 IIb in means of consumption out

of the entire second half of IIc, equal to 1,000; consequently, those

who replace the constant capital of IIa will draw:

    480 (three-fifths) out of 600c (IIa) and 320 (two-fifths) out of 400c

(IIb), a total of 800;

    those who replace the constant capital of IIb will draw:

    120 (three-fifths) out of 600c (IIa) and 80 (two-fifths) out of 400c

(IIb), which equals 200. Grand total = 1,000.    What is arbitrary here is the ratio of the variable to the constant

capital of both I and II and so is the identity of this ratio for I and II and

their  sub-divisions.  As  for  this  identity,  it  has  been  assumed  here

merely for the sake of simplification, and it would not alter in any way

the conditions of the problem and its solution if we were to assume

different proportions. However, the necessary result of all this, on the

assumption of simple reproduction, is the following.

    1) That the new value created by the labor of one year (divisible

into v + s) in the bodily form of means of production is equal to the

value of the constant capital c contained in the value of the product

created by the other part of the annual labor and reproduced in the

form of articles of consumption. If it were smaller than II c, it would be

impossible  for  II  to  replace  its  constant  capital  entirely;  if  it  were

greater,  a  surplus  would  remain  unused.  In  either  case,  the

assumption of simple reproduction would be violated.

    2) That in the case of annual product which is reproduced in the

form of articles of consumption, the variable capital v advanced in the

form of money can be realized by its recipients, inasmuch as they are

laborers producing luxuries, only in that portion of the necessities of

life  which  embodies  for  their  capitalist  producers  prima  facie  their

surplus value; hence that v, laid out in the production of luxuries, is

equal in value to a corresponding portion of s produced in the form of

necessities of life, and hence must be smaller than the whole of this s,

namely (IIa) s, and that the variable capital advanced by the capitalist

producers of luxuries returns to them in the form of money only by

means of the realization of that v in this portion of s. This phenomenon

is quite analogous to the realization of I(v + s) in IIc, except that in the

second case (Ilb)v realizes itself in a part of (IIa)s of the same value.

These  proportions  remain  qualitatively  determinant  in  every

distribution of the total annual product, since it actually enters into the

process of the annual reproduction brought about by circulation. I(v +

s)  can  be  realized  only  in  IIc,  just  as  IIc  can  only  be  renewed  in

function as a component part of productive capital by means of this

realization; in the same way, (IIb)v can be realized only in a portion of

(IIa) s and (IIb)v can only thus be reconverted into the form of money

capital. It goes without saying that this applies only to the extent that it

all is really a result of the process of reproduction itself, i.e., to theextent  that  the  capitalists  of  IIb,  for  instance,  do  not  obtain  money

capital  for  v  on  credit  from  others.  Quantitatively  however  the

exchanges  of  the  various  portions  of  the  annual  product  can  take

place in the proportions indicated above only so long as the scale and

value relations in production remain stationary and so long as these

strict relations are not altered by foreign commerce [...]

    In the exchange established above of (IIb)v for a portion of (IIa)s

of the same value, and in the further exchanges between (IIa)s, and

(IIb)s, it is by no means assumed that either the individual capitalists

of IIa and IIb or their respective totalities divide their surplus value in

the same proportion between necessary articles of consumption and

articles of luxury. The one may spend more on this consumption, the

other more on that. On the basis of simple reproduction, it is merely

assumed  that  a  sum  of  values  equal  to  the  entire  surplus  value  is

realized  in  the  consumption  fund.  The  limits  are  thus  given.  Within

each department the one may spend more in a, the other in b. But this

may compensate itself mutually, so that the capitalist groups of an and

b, taken as a whole, each participate in the same proportion in both.

The  value  relations  —  the  proportional  shares  of  the  two  kinds  of

producers, an and b in the total value of product II — consequently

also  a  definite  quantitative  relation  between  the  branches  of

production supplying those products — are however necessarily given

in each concrete case; only the proportion chosen as an illustration is

a hypothetical one. It would not alter the qualitative aspects if another

illustration were selected; only the quantitative determinations would

be altered. But if on account of any circumstances there arises an

actual change in the relative magnitude of an and b, the conditions of

simple reproduction would also change accordingly [...]

    Simple reproduction is essentially directed toward consumption as

an  end,  although  the  grabbing  of  surplus  value  appears  as  the

compelling  motive  of  the  individual  capitalists;  but  surplus  value,

whatever its relative magnitude may be, is after all supposed to serve

here only for the individual consumption of the capitalist.

    As simple reproduction is a part, and the most important one at

that,  of  all  annual  reproduction  on  an  extended  scale,  this  motive

remains as an accompaniment of and contrast to the self-enrichment

motive as such. In reality the matter is more complicated, becausepartners in the loot — the surplus value of the capitalist — figure as

consumers independent of him.



    V. The Mediation of Exchange by The Circulation of Money


    So  far  as  we  have  analyzed  circulation  up  to  the  present,  it

proceeded between the various classes of producers as indicated in

the following scheme:

    1) Between class I and class II:

    I. 4,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s II.............2,000c...........+ 500v+ 500s

    This disposes of the circulation of IIc, equal to 2,000, which is

exchanged for I (1,000v + 1,000s).

    Leaving aside for the present the 4,000 Ic there still remains the

circulation of v + s within class II. Now II(V + s) is divided between the

sub-classes IIa and IIb in the following manner:

    2) II. 500v + 500s = a (400v + 400s) + b (100v + 100s).

    The 400v (a) circulates within its own sub-class; the laborers paid

with it buy from their employers, the capitalists IIa, necessary means

of subsistence produced by themselves.

    Since the capitalists of both sub-classes spend three-fifths of their

surplus value in products of IIa (necessities) and two-fifths in products

of IIb (luxuries), the three-fifths of the surplus value of a, or 240, are

consumed  within  the  sub-class  IIa  itself;  likewise,  two-fifths  of  the

surplus value of b (produced and existing in the form of articles of

luxury), within the sub-class IIb.

    There remains to be exchanged between IIa and IIb:

    On the side of IIa: 160s;

    On the side of IIb: 100v + 60s.

    These cancel each other. With their 100, received in the form of

money wages, the laborers of IIb buy necessities of life in that amount

from IIa. The IIb capitalists likewise buy necessities from IIa to the

amount of three-fifths of their surplus value, or 60. The IIa capitalists

thus obtain the money required for investing, as above assumed, two-

fifths of their surplus value, or 160s, in luxuries produced by IIb (100v,

held by the IIb capitalists as a product replacing the wages paid by

them, and 60s). The scheme for this is therefore:    3) Ila. //400v // + //240s// + 160s

      b.....................100v + 60s + //40s//,

    the bracketed items circulating and being consumed only within

their own sub-class.

    The direct reflux of the money capital advanced in variable capital,

which  takes  place  only  in  the  case  of  the  capitalist  department  IIa

which produces necessities of life, is but an expression, modified by

special  conditions,  of  the  previously  mentioned  general  law  that

money  advanced  to  the  circulation  by  producers  of  commodities

returns to them in the normal course of commodity circulation. From

this  it  incidentally  follows  that  if  any  money  capitalist  at  all  stands

behind the producer of commodities and advances to the industrial

capitalist  money  capital  (in  the  strictest  meaning  of  the  word,  i.e.,

capital value in the form of money), the real point of reflux for this

money is the pocket of this money capitalist. Thus the mass of the

circulating money belongs to that department of money capital which

is organized and concentrated in the form of banks, etc., although the

money circulates more or less through all hands. The way in which

this department advances its capital necessitates the continual final

reflux to it in the form of money, although this is once again brought

about by the reconversion of the industrial capital into money capital.

    The circulation  of  commodities  always  requires  two  things:

Commodities which are thrown into circulation and money which is

likewise thrown into it. “The process of circulation ... does not, like

direct barter of products, become extinguished upon the use values

changing places and hands. The money does not vanish on dropping

out of the circuit of the metamorphosis of a given commodity. It is

constantly  being  precipitated  into  new  places  in  the  arena  of

circulation vacated by other commodities,” etc. (Buch I, Kap. III).

    For  instance  in  the  circulation  between  II  c  and  I(v  +  s)  we

assumed  that  II  had  advanced  £500  in  money  for  it.  In  the

innumerable  processes  of  circulation,  into  which  the  circulation

between  large  social  groups  of  producers  resolves  itself,

representatives of the various groups will at various times be the first

to appear as buyers, and hence throw money into circulation. Quite

apart  from  particular  circumstances,  this  is  necessitated  by  the

difference, if nothing else, in the periods of production, and thus of theturnovers, of the various commodity capitals. So with these £500 II

buys from I means of production of the same value and I buys from II

articles of consumption valued at £500. Hence the money flows back

to  II,  but  this  department  does  not  in  any  way  grow  richer  by  this

reflux.  It  had  first  thrown  £500  in  money  into  circulation  and  drew

commodities of the same value out of it; then it sells £500 worth of

commodities and draws the same amount of money out of circulation;

thus the £500 flow back to it. As a matter of fact, II has thrown into

circulation £500 in money and £500 in commodities, which is equal to

£1,000. It draws out of the circulation £500 in commodities and £500

in  money.  The  circulation  requires  for  the  handling  of  £500  in  I

commodities and £500 in II commodities only £500 in money; hence

whoever advanced the money in the purchase of commodities from

other producers recovers it when selling his own. Consequently, if I

had at first bought commodities from II for £500, and later sold to II

commodities of the value of £500, these £500 would have returned to I

instead of to II.

    In class I the money invested in wages, i.e., the variable capital

advanced in the form of money, does not return directly in this form

but indirectly, by a detour. But in II the £500 of wages return directly

from the laborers to the capitalists, and this return is always direct in

the case where purchase and sale take place repeatedly between the

same persons in such a way that they are acting alternately as buyers

and  sellers  of  commodities.  The  capitalist  of  II  pays  for  the  labor

power in money; he thereby incorporates labor power in his capital

and  assumes  the  role  of  an  industrial  capitalist  in  relation  to  his

laborers as wage-earners, but does so only by means of this act of

circulation, which is for him merely a conversion of money capital into

productive  capital.  Thereupon  the  laborer,  who  in  the  first  instance

was a seller, a dealer in his own labor power, appears in the second

instance as a buyer, a possessor of money, in relation to the capitalist,

who now acts as a seller of commodities. In this way the capitalist

recovers the money invested by him in wages. As the sale of these

commodities  does  not  imply  cheating,  etc.,  but  is  an  exchange  of

equivalents in commodities and money, it is not a process by which

the capitalist enriches himself. He does not pay the laborer twice, firstin money and then in commodities. His money returns to him as soon

as the laborer exchanges it for his commodities.

    However, the money capital converted into variable capital, i.e.,

the  money  advanced  for  wages,  plays  a  prominent  role  in  the

circulation of money itself, since the laborers must live from hand to

mouth and cannot give the industrial capitalists credit for any length of

time. For this reason, variable capital must be advanced in the form of

money  simultaneously  at  innumerable  territorially  different  points  in

society at certain short intervals, such as a week, etc. in periods of

time  that  repeat  themselves  rather  quickly  (and  the  shorter  these

periods, the smaller relatively is the total amount of money thrown at

one time into circulation through this channel) — whatever the various

periods of turnover of the capitals in the different branches of industry.

In  every  country  with  a  capitalist  production  the  money  capital  so

advanced constitutes a relatively decisive share of the total circulation,

the  more  so  as  the  same  money,  before  its  reflux  to  its  point  of

departure, passes through the most diverse channels and functions as

a medium of circulation for countless other businesses.

    Now let us consider the circulation between I(v + s) and IIc from a

different angle.

    Capitalists I advance £1,000 in the payment of wages. With this

money the laborers buy £1,000 worth of means of subsistence from

capitalists  II.  These  in  turn  buy  for  the  same  money  means  of

production from capitalists I. Capitalists I thus get back their variable

capital in the form of money, while capitalists II have reconverted one

half of their constant capital from the form of commodity capital into

that  of  productive  capital.  Capitalists  II  advance  another  £500  in

money to get means of production from I. The capitalists I spend this

money on articles of consumption from II. These £500 thus return to

capitalists II. They advance this amount again in order to reconvert the

last quarter of their constant capital, converted into commodities, into

its productive bodily form. This money flows back to I and once more

withdraws articles of consumption of the same amount from II. Thus

the £500 return to II. The capitalists II are now as before in possession

of  £500  in  money  and  £2,000  in  constant  capital,  the  latter  having

been newly converted from the form of commodity capital into that of

productive  capital.  By  means  of  £1,500  a  quantity  of  commoditiesworth £5,000 has been circulated. Namely: 1) I pays £1,000 to his

laborers for their labor power of the same value; 2) With these same

£1,000  the  laborers  buy  means  of  subsistence  from  II;  3)  With  the

same money II buys means of production from I, thereby restoring to I

variable capital to the amount of £1,000 in the form of money; 4) II

buys  £500  worth  of  means  of  production  from  I;  5)  With  the  same

£500 I buys articles of consumption from II; 6) With the same £500 II

buys means of production from I; 7) With the same £500 I buys means

of  subsistence  from  II.  Thus  £500  have  returned  to  II,  which  had

thrown them into circulation besides its £2,000 in commodities and for

which  it  did  not  withdraw  from  circulation  any  equivalent  in

commodities.

    The exchange therefore takes the following course:

    1) I pay £1,000 in money for labor power, hence for commodities

equal to £1,000.

    2)  The  laborers  buy  with  their  wages  amounting  in  money  to

£1,000 articles of consumption from II; hence commodities equal to

£1,000.

    3) With the £1,000 received from the laborers II buys means of

production  of  the  same  value  from  I;  hence  commodities  equal  to

£1,000.

    In this way the £l.000 have returned to I as the money form of its

variable capital.

    218

    4)  II  buys  £500  worth  of  means  of  production  from  I,  hence

commodities equal to £500.

    5)  With  the  same  £500  I  buy  articles  of  consumption  from  II;

hence commodities equal to £500.

    6) With the same £500 II buys means of production from I; hence

commodities equal to £500.

    7)  With  the  same  £500  I  buy  articles  of  consumption  from  II;

hence commodities equal to £500.

    Total amount of commodity values exchanged: £5,000.

    The £500 advanced by II for the purchase have returned to it.

    The result is as follows:

    1) I possess variable capital in the form of money to the amount of

£1,000, which it originally advanced to the circulation. It furthermoreexpended £1,000 for its individual consumption, in the shape of its

own products; i.e., it has spent the money which it had received for the

sale of means of production to the amount of £1,000.

    On the other hand, the natural form into which the variable capital

existing in the form of money must be transformed, i.e., labor power,

has  been  maintained,  reproduced  and  again  made  available  by

consumption as the sole article of trade of its owners, which they must

sell in order to live. The relation of wage laborers and capitalists has

likewise been reproduced.

    2) The constant capital of II is replaced in natura, and the £500

advanced by the same II to the circulation have returned to it.

    As for the laborers I, the circulation is the simple one of C—M—

C:C’ (labor power) —M2 (£1,000, money form of variable capital I) —

C3 (necessities of life to the amount of £1,000); these £1,000 convert

into money to the same amount of value the constant capital II existing

in the form of commodities, of means of subsistence.

    As for the capitalists II, the process is C— M, the transformation

of  a  portion  of  their  commodity  product  into  the  money  form,  from

which  it  is  reconverted  into  the  constituents  of  productive  capital,

namely into a portion of the means of production required by them. In

the money advance (£500) made by capitalists II for the purchase of

the other parts of the means of production, the money form of that

portion of IIc which exists as yet in the form of commodities (articles of

consumption) is anticipated; in the act M — C, in which II buys with M,

and C is sold by I, the money (II) is converted into a portion of the

productive capital, while C (I) passes through the act C — M, changes

into money, which however does not represent any component part of

capital  value  for  I,  but  surplus  value  converted  into  money  and

expended solely for articles of consumption.

    In the circuit M — C ... P ... C’ — M’, the first act, M — C, is that of

one  capitalist,  the  last,  C’  —  M’  (or  part  of  it),  is  that  of  another;

whether  the  C,  by  which  M  is  converted  into  productive  capital,

represents  a  component  of  constant  capital,  of  variable  capital,  or

surplus value for the seller of C (who exchanges this C for money), is

wholly immaterial for the commodity circulation itself.

    Class I, so far as concerns the component v + s of its commodity

product, draws more money out of the circulation than it has thrown in.In  the  first  place,  the  £1,000  of  variable  capital  return  to  it;  in  the

second place, it sells means of production worth £500 (see above,

exchange  No.  4);  one  half  of  its  surplus  value  is  thus  turned  into

money; then (exchange No. 6) it sells once more £500 worth of means

of production, the second half of its surplus value, and thus the entire

surplus  value  is  withdrawn  from  circulation  in  the  shape  of  money.

Hence  in  succession:  1)  variable  capital  reconverted  into  money,

equal to £1,000; 2) one half of the surplus value turned into money,

equal to £500; 3) the other half of the surplus value, equal to £500;

altogether  1,000v  +  1,000s  turned  into  money,  equal  to  £2,000.

Although  I  threw  only  £1,000  into  circulation  (aside  from  those

exchanges which promote the reproduction of Ic and which we shall

have to analyses later), it has withdrawn double that amount from it.

Of  course  s  passes  into  other  hands,  (II),  as  soon  as  it  has  been

converted into money, by being spent for articles of consumption. The

capitalists of I withdrew only as much in money as they threw into it in

value in the form of commodities; the fact that this value is surplus

value, i.e., that it does not cost the capitalists anything, does not alter

the value of these commodities in any way; so far as the exchange of

values  in  commodity  circulation  is  concerned,  that  fact  is  of  no

consequence  at  all.  The  existence  of  surplus  value  in  money  is  of

course  transient,  the  same  as  all  other  forms  which  the  advanced

capital  assumes  in  its  metamorphoses.  It  lasts  no  longer  than  the

interval between the conversion of commodities I into money and the

subsequent conversion of the money I into commodities II.

    If the turnovers had been assumed to be shorter — or, from the

point of view of the simple circulation of commodities, the circulation of

money more rapid — even less money would be ample to circulate the

exchanged commodity values; the amount is always determined — if

the number of successive exchanges is given — by the sum of the

prices,  or  the  sum  of  values,  of  the  circulating  commodities.  It  is

immaterial in what proportion this sum of values consists of surplus

value on the one hand, and of capital value on the other.

    If the wages of I, in our illustration, were paid four times per year,

we should have 4 times 250, or 1,000. Hence £250 in money would

suffice for the circulation Iv — IIc, and for that between the variable

capital Iv and the labor power I. Likewise, if the circulation between Isand IIc were to take place in four turnovers, it would require only £250,

or in the aggregate a sum of money, or a money capital, of £500 for

the circulation of commodities amounting to £5,000. In that case the

surplus value would be converted into money four times successively,

one-quarter each time, instead of twice successively, one half each

time [...]

    If a capitalist (we have only industrial capitalists still to deal with

here,  who  are  the  representatives  of  all  others)  spends  money  for

articles of consumption, he is through with it, it goes the way of all

flesh. It can flow back to him only if he fishes it out of circulation in

exchange for commodities, i.e., for his commodity capital. As the value

of  his  entire  annual  commodity  product  (his  commodity  capital),  so

that of every one of its elements, i.e., the value of every individual

commodity, is divisible, as far as he is concerned, into constant capital

value, variable capital value, and surplus value. The conversion into

money  of  every  individual  commodity  (as  elements  constituting  the

commodity  product)  is  consequently  at  the  same  time  such  a

conversion of a certain portion of the surplus value contained in the

entire commodity product. In this case, then, it is literally true that the

capitalist himself threw the money into circulation — when he spent it

on articles of consumption — by which his surplus value is converted

into money, or realized. Of course it is not a question of the identical

coins but of a certain amount of hard cash equal to the one (or to a

portion of the one) which he had previously thrown into circulation to

satisfy his personal wants.

    In practice this occurs in two ways. If the business has just been

opened, in the current year, it will take quite a while, at least a few

months, before the capitalist is able to use any portion of the receipts

of his business for his personal consumption. But for all that he does

not suspend his consumption for a single moment. He advances to

himself  (immaterial  whether  out  of  his  own  pocket  or  by  means  of

credit  from  the  pocket  of  somebody  else)  money  in  anticipation  of

surplus  value  still  to  be  snatched  by  him;  but  in  doing  so  he  also

advances a circulating medium for the realization of surplus value to

be realized later. If, on the contrary, the business has been running

regularly for a longer period, payments and receipts are distributed

over  different  terms  throughout  the  year.  But  one  thing  continuesuninterruptedly,  namely,  the  consumption  of  the  capitalist,  which

anticipates, and whose volume is computed on a definite proportion

of,  the  customary  or  estimated  revenue.  With  every  portion  of

commodities  sold,  a  portion  of  the  surplus  value  to  be  produced

annually is also realized. But if during the entire year only as much of

the  produced  commodities  is  sold  as  is  required  to  replace  the

constant and variable capital values contained in them, or if prices

were to fall to such an extent that only the advanced capital value

contained in the entire annual commodity product should be realized

on its sale, then the anticipatory character of the expenditure of money

in expectation of future surplus value would be clearly revealed. If our

capitalist  fails,  his  creditors  and  the  court  investigate  whether  his

anticipated  private  expenditures  were  in  proper  proportion  to  the

volume of his business and to the receipt of surplus value usually or

normally corresponding to it.

    So far as the entire capitalist class is concerned, the proposition

that  it  must  itself  throw  into  circulation  the  money  required  for  the

realization of its surplus value (correspondingly also for the circulation

of  its  capital,  constant  and  variable)  not  only  fails  to  appear

paradoxical, but stands forth as a necessary condition of the entire

mechanism. For there are here only two classes: the working class

disposing only of its labor power, and the capitalist class, which has a

monopoly  of  the  social  means  of  production  and  money.  It  would

rather be a paradox if the working class were to advance in the first

instance from its own resources the money required for the realization

of the surplus value contained in the commodities. But the individual

capitalist makes this advance only by acting as a buyer, expending

money in the purchase of articles of consumption or advancing money

in the purchase of elements of his productive capital, whether of labor

power or means of production. He never parts with his money unless

he gets an equivalent for it. He advances money to the circulation only

in the same way as he advances commodities to it. He acts in both

instances as the initial point of their circulation.

    The actual process is obscured by two circumstances:

    1)  The  appearance  in  the  process  of  circulation  of  industrial

capital of merchant’s capital (the first form of which is always money,

since  the  merchant  as  such  does  not  create  any  “product”  or“commodity”) and of money capital as an object of manipulation by a

special kind of capitalists.

    2) The division of surplus value - which must always be first in the

hands of the industrial capitalist - into various categories, as vehicles

of which there appear, aside from the industrial capitalist, the landlord

(for  ground  rent),  the  usurer  (for  interest),  etc.,  furthermore  the

government and its employees, rentiers, etc. This gentry appear as

buyers  vis-à-vis  the  industrial  capitalist  and  to  that  extent  as

converters of his commodities into money; they too throw “money” pro

parte into the circulation and he gets it from them. But it is always

forgotten  from  what  source  they  derived  it  originally,  and  continue

deriving it ever anew [...]



    VII. Variable Capital and Surplus Value in Both Departments


    The total value of the annually produced articles of consumption is

thus equal to the variable capital value II reproduced during the year

plus  the  newly  produced  surplus  value  II  (i.e.,  equal  to  the  value

produced  by  II  during  the  year)  plus  the  variable  capital  value  I

reproduced during the year and the newly produced surplus value I

(i.e., plus the value created by I during the year).

    On the assumption of simple reproduction, the total value of the

annually produced articles of consumption is therefore equal to the

annual value product, i.e., equal to the total value produced during the

year  by  social  labor,  and  this  must  be  so,  because  in  simple

reproduction this entire value is consumed.

    The  total  social  working  day  is  divided  into  two  parts:  1)

Necessary labor which creates in the course of the year a value of

1,500v; 2) surplus labor, which creates an additional value, or surplus

value, of 1,500s. The sum of these values, 3,000, is equal to the value

of the annually produced articles of consumption — 3,000. The total

value  of  the  articles  of  consumption  produced  during  the  year  is

therefore equal to the total value produced by the total social working

day during the year, equal to the value of the social variable capital

plus the social surplus value, equal to the total new product of the

year.    But  we  know  that  even  if  these  two  magnitudes  of  value  are

equal, this in no way means that the total value of commodities II, the

articles  of  consumption,  has  been  produced  in  this  department  of

social production. They are equal because the constant capital value

re-appearing in II is equal to the value newly produced by I (value of

variable capital plus surplus value); therefore I(v + s) can buy the part

of the product of II which represents the constant capital value for its

producers (in department II). This shows, then, why the value of the

product  of  capitalists  II,  from  the  point  of  view  of  society,  may  be

resolved into v + s although for these capitalists it is divided into c + v

+ s. This is so only because IIc is here equal to I(v + s), and because

these two components of the social product interchange their natural

forms by exchange, so that after this transformation IIc exists once

more in means of production and I(v + s) in articles of consumption.

    And it is this circumstance which induced Adam Smith to maintain

that the value of the annual product resolves itself into v + s. This is

true  1)  only  for  that  part  of  the  annual  product  which  consists  of

articles of consumption; and 2) it is not true in the sense that this total

value is produced in II and that the value of its product is equal to the

value  of  the  variable  capital  advanced  in  II  plus  the  surplus  value

produced in II. It is true only in the sense that II(C + v + s) is equal to

II(v + s) + I(v + s), or because IIc is equal to I(v + s).

    It follows furthermore:

    The  social  working  day  (i.e.,  the  labor  expended  by  the  entire

working  class  during  the  whole  year),  like  every  individual  working

day, breaks up into only two parts, namely into necessary labor and

surplus  labor,  and  the  value  produced  by  this  working  day

consequently likewise resolves itself into only two parts, namely into

the value of the variable capital, or that portion of the value with which

the laborer buys the means of his own reproduction, and the surplus

value  which  the  capitalist  may  spend  for  his  own  individual

consumption. Nevertheless, from the point of view of society, one part

of the social working day is spent exclusively on the production of new

constant capital, namely of products exclusively intended to function

as means of production in the labor process and hence as constant

capital  in  the  accompanying  process  of  self-expansion  of  value.

According  to  our  assumption  the  total  social  working  day  presentsitself as a money value of 3,000, only one-third of which, or 1,000, is

produced  in  department  II  which  manufactures  articles  of

consumption, that is, the commodities in which the entire value of the

variable capital and the entire surplus value of society are ultimately

realized. Thus, according to this assumption, two-thirds of the social

working day are employed in the production of new constant capital.

Although from the standpoint of the individual capitalists and laborers

of  department  I  these  two-thirds  of  the  social  working  day  serve

merely for the production of variable capital value plus surplus value,

the same as the last third of the social working day in department II,

still from the point of view of society and likewise of the use value of

the product, these two-thirds of the social working day produce only

replacement  of  constant  capital  in  the  process  of  productive

consumption or already so consumed. Also when viewed individually

these  two-thirds  of  the  working  day,  while  producing  a  total  value

equal only to the value of the variable capital plus surplus value for the

producer, nevertheless do not produce any use values of a kind on

which wages or surplus value could be expended; for their products

are means of production.

    It must be noted in the first place that no portion of the social

working day, whether in I or in II, serves for the production of the value

of the constant capital employed and functioning in these two great

spheres of production. They produce only additional value, 2,000 I (v +

s) + 1,000 II(V + s), in addition to the value of the constant capital

equal to 4,000 I c + 2,000 IIc. The new value produced in the form of

means of production is not yet constant capital. It merely is intended to

function as such in the future.

    The entire product of II — the articles of consumption — viewed

concretely as a use value, in its natural form, is a product of the one-

third of the social working day spent by II. It is the product of labor in

its  concrete  form  —  such  as  the  labor  of  weaving,  baking,  etc.,

performed in this department — the product of this labor, inasmuch as

it functions as the subjective element of the labor process. As to the

constant portion of the value of this product II, it re-appears only in a

new  use  value,  in  a  new  natural  form,  the  form  of  articles  of

consumption,  while  it  existed  previously  in  the  form  of  means  of

production. Its value has been transferred by the labor process fromits old natural form to its new natural form. But the value of these two-

thirds of the product-value, equal to 2,000, has not been produced in

this year’s self-expansion process of II.

    Just as from the point of view of the labor process, the product of

II is the result of newly functioning living labor and of the assumed

means of production assigned to it, in which that labor materializes

itself as in its objective conditions, so, from the point of view of the

process  of  self-expansion,  the  value  of  the  product  of  II,  equal  to

3,000, is composed of a new value (500v + 500s = 1,000) produced

by  the  newly  added  one-third  of  the  social  working  day  and  of  a

constant  value  in  which  are  embodied  two-thirds  of  a  past  social

working  day  that  had  elapsed  before  the  present  process  of

production of II here under consideration. This portion of the value of

the  II  product  finds  expression  in  a  portion  of  the  product  itself.  It

exists  in  a  quantity  of  articles  of  consumption  worth  2,000,  or  two-

thirds of a social working day. This is the new use form in which this

value-portion  re-appears.  The  exchange  of  part  of  the  articles  of

consumption equal to 2,000 II c for means of production of I equal to I

(1,000v + l,000s) thus really represents an exchange of two-thirds of

an aggregate working day — which do not constitute any portion of

this year’s labor, and elapsed before this year — for two-thirds of the

working day newly added this year. Two-thirds of this year’s social

working  day  could  not  be  employed  in  the  production  of  constant

capital  and  at  the  same  time  constitute  variable  capital  value  plus

surplus  value  for  their  own  producers  unless  they  were  to  be

exchanged for a portion of the value of the annually consumed articles

of consumption, in which are incorporated two-thirds of a working day

spent and realized before this year. It is an exchange of two-thirds of

this year’s working day for two-thirds of a working day spent before

this year, an exchange of this year’s labor time for last year’s. This

explains the riddle of how the value product of an entire social working

day can resolve itself into variable capital value plus surplus value,

although  two-thirds  of  this  working  day  were  not  expended  in  the

production of articles in which variable capital or surplus value can be

realized, but rather in the production of means of production for the

replacement of the capital consumed during the year. The explanation

is simply that two-thirds of the value of the product of II, in which thecapitalists  and  laborers  of  I  realize  the  variable  capital  value  plus

surplus value produced by them (and which constitute two-ninths of

the value of the entire annual product), are, so far as their value is

concerned, the product of two-thirds of a social working day of a year

prior to the current one [...]



    VIII. The Constant Capital in Both Departments


    The analysis of the total value of the product of 9,000, and of the

categories  into  which  it  is  divided,  does  not  present  any  greater

difficulty than that of the value produced by an individual capital. On

the contrary, they are identical.

    The  entire  annual  social  product  here  contains  three  social

working days, each of one year. The value expressed by each one of

these working days is 3,000, so that the value expressed by the total

product is equal to 3 x 3,000, or 9,000.

    Furthermore,  the  following  portions  of  this  working  time  have

elapsed prior to the one-year process of production, the product of

which we are now analyzing: In department I four-thirds of a working

day (with a product worth 4,000), and in department II two-thirds of a

working day (with a product worth 2,000), making a total of two social

working days with a product worth 6,000. For this reason, 4,000 Ic +

2,000 IIc = 6,000c figure as the value of the means of production, or

the constant capital value re-appearing in the total value of the social

product.

    Furthermore,  one-third  of  the  social  working  day  of  one  year

newly added in department I is necessary labor, or labor replacing the

value of the variable capital of 1,000 Iv and paying the price of the

labor employed by I. In the same way one-sixth of a social working

day in II is necessary labor with a value of 500. Hence 1,000 Iv + 500

IIv = 1,500v, expressing the value of one half of the social working

day, is the value-expression of the first half of the aggregate working

day added this year and consisting of necessary labor.

    Finally, in department I one-third of the aggregate working day,

with a product worth 1,000, is surplus labor, and in department II one-

sixth of the working day, with a product worth 500, is surplus labor.Together they constitute the other half of the added aggregate working

day. Hence the total surplus value produced is equal to l,000 I s + 500

IIs, or 1,500s.

    Thus:

    The constant capital portion of the value of the social product (c):

    Two working days expended prior to the process of production;

value expression = 6,000.

    Necessary labor (v) expended during the year:

    One half of a working day expended on the annual production;

value expression = 1,500.

    Surplus labor (s) expended during the year:

    One half of a working day expended on the annual production;

value expression = 1,500.

    Value produced by annual labor (v + s) = 3,000.

    Total value of product (c + v + s) = 9,000.

    [...]    Chapter 18: Accumulation and Reproduction On an Extended

                                          Scale



    It has been shown in Book I how accumulation works in the case

of the individual capitalist. By the conversion of the commodity capital

into  money  the  surplus  product,  in  which  the  surplus  value  is

represented, is also turned into money. The capitalist reconverts the

so metamorphosed surplus value into additional natural elements of

his productive capital. In the next cycle of production, the increased

capital furnishes an increased product. But what happens in the case

of the individual capital must also show in the annual reproduction as

a  whole,  just  as  we  have  seen  it  happen  on  analyzing  simple

reproduction, namely, that the successive precipitation — in the case

of individual capital — of its used-up fixed component parts in money

which  is  being  hoarded,  also  finds  expression  in  the  annual

reproduction of society.

    If  a  certain  individual  capital  is  equal  to  400c  +  l00v,  and  the

annual  surplus  value  is  equal  to  100,  then  the  commodity  product

amounts to 400c + 100v + 100s. These 600 are converted into money.

Of  this  money,  again,  400c  are  converted  into  the  natural  form  of

constant  capital,  100v  into  labor  power,  and  -  provided  the  entire

surplus value is being accumulated - 100s are converted besides into

additional constant capital by transformation into natural elements of

the productive capital. It is assumed in this case: 1) that this amount is

sufficient  under  the  given  technical  conditions  either  to  expand  the

functioning constant capital or to establish a new industrial business.

But  it  may  also  happen  that  surplus  value  must  be  converted  into

money and this money hoarded for a much longer time before this

process, i.e., before real accumulation, expansion of production, can

take place; 2) that production on an extended scale has actually been

in process previously.

    For in order that the money (the surplus value hoarded in money

form) may be converted into elements of productive capital, one mustbe  able  to  buy  these  elements  on  the  market  as  commodities.  It

makes no difference if they are not bought as finished products but

made to order. They are not paid for until they are in existence and at

any  rate  not  until  actual  reproduction  on  an  extended  scale,  an

expansion of hitherto normal production, has taken place so far as

they  are  concerned.  They  had  to  exist  potentially,  i.e.,  in  their

elements,  as  it  requires  only  the  impulse  of  an  order,  that  is,  the

purchase  of  commodities  before  they  actually  exist  and  their

anticipated sale, for their production really to take place. The money

on the one side then calls forth extended reproduction on the other,

because the possibility of it exists without money. For money in itself

is not an element of real reproduction.

    For instance, capitalist A, who sells during one year or during a

number  of  years’  certain  quantities  of  commodities  successively

produced by him, thereby converts into money also that portion of the

commodities which is the vehicle of surplus value - the surplus product

-  or  in  other  words  the  very  surplus  value  produced  by  him  in

commodity form, accumulates it gradually, and thus forms for himself

new potential money capital - potential because of its capacity and

mission  to  be  converted  into  elements  of  productive  capital.  But  in

actual  fact  he  only  engages  in  simple  hoarding,  which  is  not  an

element  of  actual  reproduction.  His  activity  at  first  consists  only  in

successively withdrawing circulating money out of the circulation. Of

course it is not impossible that the circulating money thus kept under

lock and key by him was itself, before it entered into circulation, a

portion of some other hoard. This hoard of A, which is potentially new

money capital, is not additional social wealth, any more than it would

be if it were spent in articles of consumption. But money withdrawn

from circulation, which therefore previously existed in circulation, may

have been stored up at some prior time as a component part of a

hoard, may have been the money form of wages, may have converted

means of production or other commodities into money or may have

circulated  portions  of  constant  capital  or  the  revenue  of  some

capitalist.

    It is no newer wealth than money, considered from the standpoint

of the simple circulation of commodities, is the vehicle not only of its

actual value but also of its ten-fold value, because it was turned overten  times  a  day,  realized  ten  different  commodity  values.  The

commodities  exist  without  it,  and  it  itself  remains  what  it  is  (or

becomes even less by depreciation) whether in one turnover or in ten.

Only  in  the  production  of  gold  —  inasmuch  as  the  gold  product

contains a surplus product, a depository of surplus value — is new

wealth (potential money) created, and it increases the money material

of  new  potential  money  capitals  only  so  far  as  the  entire  money

product enters into circulation.

    Although this surplus value hoarded in the form of money is not

additional  new  social  wealth,  it  represents  new  potential  money

capital, on account of the function for which it is hoarded. (We shall

see later that new money capital may arise also in a way other than

the gradual conversion of surplus value into money.)

    Money is withdrawn from circulation and stored up as a hoard by

selling  commodities  without  subsequent  buying.  If  this  operation  is

therefore conceived as a general process, it seems inexplicable where

the buyers are to come from, since in that process everybody would

want to sell in order to hoard, and none would want to buy. And it must

be conceived generally, since every individual capital may be in the

process of accumulation.

    If  we  were  to  conceive  the  process  of  circulation  between  the

various parts of the annual reproduction as taking place in a straight

line  —  which  would  be  wrong  as  it  always  consists  with  a  few

exceptions of mutually opposite movements — then we should have

to start from the producer of gold (or silver) who buys without selling,

and to assume that all others sell to him. In that case the entire yearly

social surplus product (the bearer of the entire surplus value) would

pass  into  his  hands,  and  all  the  other  capitalists  would  distribute

among themselves pro rata his surplus product, which naturally exists

in the form of money, the natural embodiment in gold of his surplus

value. For that portion of the product of the gold producer which has to

make good his active capital is already tied up and disposed of. The

surplus value of the gold producer, created in the form of gold, would

then be the sole fund from which all other capitalists would draw the

material for the conversion of their annual surplus product into money.

The magnitude of its value would then have to be equal to the entire

annual surplus value of society, which must first assume the guise of ahoard. Absurd as these assumptions would be, they would do nothing

more than explain the possibility of a universal simultaneous formation

of  a  hoard,  and  would  not  get  reproduction  itself  one  step  further,

except on the part of the gold producer.

    Before  we  resolve  this  seeming  difficulty  we  must  distinguish

between  the  accumulation  in  department  I  (production  of  means  of

production)  and  in  department  II  (production  of  articles  of

consumption). We shall start with I [...]



    I. Accumulation in Department I


    1. THE FORMATION OF A HOARD

    [...] For instance, let A sell 600 (equal to 400c + 100v + 100s) to B

(who may represent more than one buyer). A sells 600 in commodities

for 600 in money, of which 100 are surplus value which he withdraws

from circulation and hoards in the form of money. But these 100 in

money are but the money form of the surplus product, which was the

bearer of a value of 100. The formation of a hoard is no production at

all, hence not an increment of production, either. The action of the

capitalist consists here merely in withdrawing from circulation the 100

in money he grabbed by the sale of his surplus product, holding on to

it and impounding it. This operation is carried on not alone by A, but at

numerous points along the periphery of circulation by other capitalists,

A’, A", A'", all of them working with equal zeal at this sort of hoard

formation [.]

    One  can  understand  the  pleasure  experienced  when  all  these

potential capitals within the credit system, by their concentration in the

hands of banks, etc., become disposable, "loanable capital,” money

capital, which indeed is no longer passive and music of the future, but

active capital growing rank [...]

    It  must  be  noted  at  this  point  first  and  foremost  that  although

withdrawing money to the amount of his surplus value from circulation

and hoarding it, A on the other hand throws commodities into it without

withdrawing other commodities in return. The capitalists B, B’, B", etc.,

are thereby enabled to throw money into circulation and withdraw only

commodities  from  it.  In  the  present  case  these  commodities,according  to  their  bodily  form  and  their  destination,  enter  into  the

constant capital of B, B’, etc., as fixed or circulating element. We shall

hear more about this anon when we deal with the buyer of the surplus

product, with B, B’, etc.

    [... In] the exchange of Iv for a corresponding amount of value of

IIc, there takes place in the end, precisely for IIc, a replacement of

commodities II by an equivalent commodity value I, that therefore on

the part of aggregate capitalist II the sale of his own commodities is

subsequently supplemented by the purchase of commodities from I of

the same amount of value. This replacement takes place. But what

does not take place is an exchange between capitalists I and II of their

respective  goods.  IIc  sells  its  commodities  to  working  class  I.  The

latter  confronts  it  one-sidedly,  as  a  buyer  of  commodities,  and  it

confronts that class one-sidedly as a seller of commodities. With the

money proceeds so obtained IIc confronts aggregate capitalist I one-

sidedly as a buyer of commodities, and aggregate capitalist I confronts

it one-sidedly as a seller of commodities up to the amount of Iv. It is

only by means of this sale of commodities that I finally reproduce its

variable capital in the form of money capital. If capital I faces that of II

one-sidedly as a seller of commodities to the amount of Iv, it faces

working  class  I  as  a  buyer  of  commodities  purchasing  their  labor

power. And if working class, I faces capitalist II one-sidedly as a buyer

of commodities (namely, as a buyer of means of subsistence), it faces

capitalist I one-sidedly as a seller of commodities, namely, as a seller

of its labor power.

    The constant supply of labor power on the part of working class I,

the reconversion of a portion of commodity capital I into the money

form of variable capital, the replacement of a portion of commodity

capital  II  by  natural  elements  of  constant  capital  IIc  —  all  these

necessary premises demand one another, but they are brought about

by  a  very  complicated  process,  including  three  processes  of

circulation which occur independently of one another but intermingle.

This process is so complicated that it offers ever so many occasions

for running abnormally.

    2. THE ADDITIONAL CONSTANT CAPITAL

    The surplus product, the bearer of surplus value, does not cost its

appropriators, capitalists I, anything. They are by no manner of meansobliged to advance any money or commodities in order to obtain it.

Even  among  the  physiocrats  an  advance  was  the  general  form  of

value  embodied  in  elements  of  productive  capital.  Hence  what

capitalists I advance is nothing but their constant and variable capital.

The laborer not only preserves by his labor their constant capital; he

not only replaces the value of their variable capital by a corresponding

newly  created  portion  of  value  in  the  form  of  commodities;  by  his

surplus labor he supplies them with a surplus value existing in the

form of surplus product. By the successive sale of this surplus product

they  form  a  hoard,  additional  potential  money  capital.  In  the  case

under consideration, this surplus product consists from the outset of

means of production of means of production. It is only when it reaches

the hands of B, B’, B’’, etc. (I) that this surplus product functions as

additional  constant  capital.  But  it  is  this virtualiter  even  before  it  is

sold, even in the hands of the accumulators of hoards, A, A’, A" (I). If

we consider merely the amount of value of the reproduction on the

part of I, we are still moving within the bounds of simple reproduction,

for no additional capital has been set in motion to create this virtualiter

additional constant capital (the surplus product), nor has any greater

amount  of  surplus  labor  been  expended  than  that  on  the  basis  of

simple reproduction.

    The  difference  is  here  only  in  the  form  of  the  surplus  labor

performed, in the concrete nature of its particular useful character. It

has been expended in means of production for Ic instead of IIc, in

means  of  production  of  means  of  production  instead  of  means  of

production  of  articles  of  consumption.  In  the  case  of  simple

reproduction, it was assumed that the entire surplus value I is spent as

revenue, hence in commodities II. Hence the surplus value consisted

only of such means of production as have to replace constant capital

IIc  in  its  natural  form.  In  order  that  the  transition  from  simple  to

extended  reproduction  may  take  place,  production  in  department  I

must be in a position to fabricate fewer elements of constant capital

for  II  and  so  many  the  more  for  I.  This  transition,  which  does  not

always  take  place  without  difficulties,  is  facilitated  by  the  fact  that

some of the products of I may serve as means of production in either

department.    It follows, then, that, considering the matter merely from the angle

of volume of values, the material substratum of extended reproduction

is produced within simple reproduction. It is simply surplus labor of

working  class  I  expended  directly  in  the  production  of  means  of

production, in the creation of virtual additional capital I. The formation

of virtual additional money capital on the part of A, A’ and A" (I) — by

the successive sale of their surplus product which was formed without

any capitalist expenditure of money — is therefore simply the money

form of additionally produced means of production I [...]

    The  production  of  additional  virtual  money  capital  on  a  large

scale, at numerous points of the periphery of circulation, is therefore

but  a  result  and  expression  of  multifarious  production  of  virtually

additional  productive  capital,  whose  rise  does  not  itself  require

additional expenditure of money on the part of the industrial capitalist.

The  successive  transformation  of  this  virtually  additional  productive

capital into virtual money capital (hoard) on the part of A, A’, A", etc.

(I),  occasioned  by  the  successive  sale  of  their  surplus  product  —

hence  by  repeated  one-sided  sale  of  commodities  without  a

supplementing purchase — is accomplished by a repeated withdrawal

of money from circulation and a corresponding formation of a hoard.

Except in the case where the buyer is a gold producer, this hoarding

does not in any way imply additional wealth in precious metals, but

only a change in the function of money previously circulating. A while

ago it functioned as a medium of circulation, now it functions as a

hoard,  as  virtually  new  money  capital  in  the  process  of  formation.

Thus the formation of additional money capital and the quantity of the

precious metals existing in a country are not in any causal relation to

each other [.]

    Whereas the surplus product, directly produced and appropriated

by the capitalists A, A’, A" (I), is the real basis of the accumulation of

capital,  i.e.,  of  extended  reproduction,  although  it  does  not  actually

function in this capacity until it reaches the hands of B, B’, B", etc. (I),

it is on the contrary absolutely unproductive in its chrysalis stage of

money — as a hoard and virtual money capital in process of gradual

formation — runs parallel with the process of production in this form,

but lies outside of it. It is a dead weight of capitalist production. The

eagerness to utilize this surplus value accumulating as virtual moneycapital for the purpose of deriving profits or revenue from it finds its

object accomplished in the credit system and "papers" [...]

    While the sellers of the surplus product, A, A’, A’’, etc. (I), have

obtained it as a direct outcome of the process of production, which

does  not  envisage  any  additional  acts  of  circulation  except  the

advance  of  constant  and  variable  capital  required  also  in  simple

reproduction;  and  while  they  thereby  construct  the  real  basis  for

reproduction  on  an  extended  scale,  and  in  actual  fact  manufacture

virtually additional capital, the attitude of B, B’, B’’, etc. (I), is different.

1) Not until it reaches the hands of B, B’, B’’, etc. (I), will the surplus

product  of  A,  A’,  A’’,  etc.,  actually  function  as  additional  constant

capital  (we  leave  out  of  consideration  for  the  present  the  other

element  of  productive  capital,  the  additional  labor  power,  in  other

words, the additional variable capital).

    [.  It]  should  be  noted  here  that  a  large  portion  of  the  surplus

product (virtually additional constant capital), although produced by A,

A’, A’’ (I) in a given year, may not function as industrial capital in the

hands  of  B,  B’,  B"  (I)  until  the  following  year  or  still  later.  [...  The]

question arises: Whence comes the money needed for the process of

circulation?

    Since the products created by B, B’, B’’, etc. (I), re-enter in natura

into their own process, it goes without saying that pro tanto a portion

of  their  own  surplus  product  is  transferred  directly  (without  any

intervention of circulation) to their productive capital and becomes an

additional element of constant capital. And pro tanto they do not affect

the conversion of the surplus product of A, A’, etc. (I), into money.

Aside from this, where does the money come from? We know that B,

B’, B’’, etc. (I) have formed their hoard in the same way as A, A’, etc.,

by the sale of their respective surplus products. Now they have arrived

at  the  point  where  their  hoarded,  only  virtual,  money  capital  is  to

function  effectively  as  additional  money  capital.  But  this  is  merely

going  round  in  circles.  The  question  still  remains:  Where  does  the

money come from which the B’s (I) before withdrew from circulation

and accumulated?

    We know from the analysis of simple reproduction that capitalists I

and II must have a certain amount of money at hand in order to be

able to exchange their surplus product. In that case the money whichserved  only  as  revenue  to  be  spent  for  articles  of  consumption

returned  to  the  capitalists  in  the  same  measure  in  which  they  had

advanced it for the exchange of their respective commodities. Here

the same money re-appears, but performing a different function. The

A’s  and  B’s  (I)  supply  one  another  alternately  with  the  money  for

converting surplus product into additional virtual money capital, and

throw the newly formed money capital alternately back into circulation

as a means of purchase.

    The  only  assumption  made  in  this  case  is  that  the  amount  of

money in the country in question (the velocity of circulation, etc., being

constant) should suffice for both the active circulation and the reserve

hoard. As we have seen this is the same assumption as had to be

made in the case of the simple circulation of commodities. Only the

function of the hoards is different in the present case. Furthermore,

the available amount of money must be larger, first, because under

capitalist  production  all  the  products  (with  the  exception  of  newly

produced  precious  metals  and  the  few  products  consumed  by  the

producer  himself)  are  created  as  commodities  and  must  therefore

pass through the pupation stage of money; secondly, because on a

capitalist  basis  the  quantity  of  the  commodity  capital  and  the

magnitude of its value is not only absolutely greater but also grows

with incomparably greater rapidity; thirdly, because an ever expanding

variable capital must always be converted into money capital; fourthly,

because the formation of new money capitals keeps pace with the

extension of production, so that the material for corresponding hoard

formation must be available.

    The  different  B’s,  B"s,  B"'s,  etc.  (I),  whose  virtual  new  money

capital enters upon its function as active capital, may have to buy their

products (portions of their surplus product) from one another, or to sell

them to one another. Pro tanto the money advanced by them for the

circulation of their surplus product flows back under normal conditions

to the different B’s in the same proportion in which they had advanced

it  for  the  circulation  of  their  respective  commodities.  If  the  money

circulates  as  a  means  of  payment,  then  only  balances  are  to  be

squared so far as the mutual purchases and sales do not cover one

another.  But  it  is  important  first  and  foremost  to  assume  here,  as

everywhere,  metallic  circulation  in  its  simplest,  most  primitive  form,because then the flux and reflux, the squaring of balances, in short all

elements appearing under the credit system as consciously regulated

processes present themselves as existing independently of the credit

system, and the matter appears in primitive form instead of the later,

reflected form [...]

    3. THE ADDITIONAL VARIABLE CAPITAL

    Hitherto  we  have  been  dealing  only  with  additional  constant

capital.  Now  we  must  direct  our  attention  to  a  consideration  of  the

additional variable capital [...]



    II. Accumulation in Department II


    We  have  hitherto  assumed  that  A,  A’,  A"  (I)  sell  their  surplus

product to B, B’, B", etc., who belong to the same department I. But

supposing A (I) converts his surplus product into money by selling it to

one B in department

    II. This can be done only by A (I) selling means of production to B

(II) without subsequently buying articles of consumption, i.e., only by a

one-sided sale on A’s part. Now whereas IIc cannot be converted from

the commodity capital form into the bodily form of productive constant

capital unless not only Iv but also at least a portion of Is, is exchanged

for  a  portion  of  IIc,  which  IIc  exists  in  the  form  of  articles  of

consumption; but now A converts his Is into money by not making this

exchange but rather withdrawing from circulation the money obtained

from II on the sale of his Is instead of exchanging it in the purchase of

articles of consumption IIc - then what we have on the part of A (I) is

indeed a formation of additional virtual money capital, but on the other

hand a portion of the constant capital of B (II) of equal magnitude of

value is tied up in the form of commodity capital, unable to transform

itself  into  the  natural  form  of  productive,  constant  capital.  In  other

words, a portion of the commodities of B (II), and indeed prima facie a

portion  without  the  sale  of  which  he  cannot  reconvert  his  constant

capital entirely into its productive form, has become unsaleable. As far

as  this  portion  is  concerned  there  is  therefore  an  overproduction,

which,  likewise  as  far  as  the  same  portion  is  concerned,  clogs

reproduction, even on the same scale [...]    Let us now take a closer look at the accumulation in department

II.

    The first difficulty with reference to IIc, i.e., its reconversion from a

component  part  of  commodity  capital  II  into  the  natural  form  of

constant  capital  II,  concerns  simple  reproduction.  Let  us  take  the

former scheme: (1,000v + 1,000s) I are exchanged for 2,000 IIc.

    Now, if for instance one half of the surplus product of I, hence

1,000/2s  or  500  Is  is  reincorporated  in  department  I  as  constant

capital, then this portion of the surplus product, being detained in I,

cannot replace any part of IIc. Instead of being converted into articles

of consumption (and here in this section of the circulation between I

and  II  the  exchange  is  actually  mutual,  that  is,  there  is  a  double

change  of  position  of  the  commodities,  unlike  the  replacement  of

1,000 IIc by 1,000 Iv effected by the laborers of I), it is made to serve

as an additional means of production in I itself. It cannot perform this

function simultaneously in I and II. The capitalist cannot spend the

value  of  his  surplus  product  for  articles  of  consumption  and  at  the

same  time  consume  the  surplus  product  itself  productively,  i.e.,

incorporate it in his productive capital. Instead of 2,000 I(v+s), only

1,500, namely (1,000v + 500s) I, are therefore exchangeable for 2,000

IIc;  500  IIc  cannot  be  reconverted  from  the  commodity  form  into

productive  (constant)  capital  II.  Hence  there  would  be  an

overproduction  in  II,  exactly  equal  in  volume  to  the  expansion  of

production in I. This overproduction in II might react to such an extent

on I that even the reflux of the 1,000 spent by the laborers of I for

articles  of  consumption  of  II  might  take  place  but  partially,  so  that

these 1,000 would not return to the hands of capitalists I in the form of

variable money capital. These capitalists would thus find themselves

hampered even in reproduction on an unchanging scale, and this by

the bare attempt to expand it. And in this connection it must be taken

into consideration that in I only simple reproduction had actually taken

place and that its elements, as represented in our scheme, are only

differently grouped with a view to expansion in the future, say, next

year [.]



    III. Schematic Presentation of Accumulation    We  shall  now  study  reproduction  according  to  the  following

scheme.

    Scheme a) I. 4,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s = 6,000 II. 1,500c + 376v

+ 376s = 2,252

    = 8,252 Total

    We note in the first place that the sum total of the annual social

product, or 8,252, is smaller than that of the first scheme, where it was

9,000. We might just as well assume a much larger sum, for instance

one  ten  times  larger.  We  have  chosen  a  smaller  sum  than  in  our

scheme I in order to make it conspicuously clear that reproduction on

an  enlarged  scale  (which  is  here  regarded  merely  as  production

carried on with a larger investment of capital) has nothing to do with

the  absolute  volume  of  the  product,  that  for  a  given  quantity  of

commodities it implies merely a different arrangement or a different

definition of the functions of the various elements of a given product,

so that it is but a simple reproduction so far as the value of the product

is concerned. It is not the quantity but the qualitative determination of

the given elements of simple reproduction which is changed, and this

change is the material premise of a subsequent reproduction on an

extended scale.

    We  might  vary  the  scheme  by  changing  the  ratio  between  the

variable and constant capital. For instance, as follows:

    Scheme b) I. 4,000c + 875v + 875s = 5,750 II. 1,750c + 376v +

376s = 2,502

    = 8,252 Total

    This scheme seems arranged for reproduction on a simple scale,

the  surplus  value  being  entirely  consumed  as  revenue  and  not

accumulated.  In  either  case,  both  a)  and  b),  we  have  an  annual

product of the same magnitude of value, only under b) functionally its

elements are grouped in such a way that reproduction is resumed on

the  same  scale,  while  under  a)  the  functional  grouping  forms  the

material basis of reproduction on an extended scale. Under b) (875v +

875s) I, or 1,750 I(v + s), are exchanged without any surplus for 1,750

IIc while under a) the exchange of (1,000v + 1,000s) I, equal to 2,000

I(v + s), for 1,000 IIc leaves a surplus of 500 Is for accumulation in

class I.    Now let us analyses scheme a) more closely. Let us suppose that

both I and II accumulate one half of their surplus value, that is to say,

convert it into an element of additional capital, instead of spending it

as revenue. As one half of 1,000 Is, or 500, are to be accumulated in

one  form  or  another,  invested  as  additional  money  capital,  i.e.,

converted into additional productive capital, only (l,000v + 500s) I are

spent as revenue. Hence only 1,500 figures here as the normal size of

IIc. We need not further examine the exchange between 1,500 I(v + s)

and 1,500 IIc, because this has already been done under the head of

process  of  simple  reproduction.  Nor  does  4,000  Ic  require  any

attention,  since  its  re-arrangement  for  the  newly  commencing

reproduction (which this time will occur on an extended scale) was

likewise discussed as a process of simple reproduction.

    The only thing that remains to be examined by us is 500 Is and

(376v + 376s) II, inasmuch as it is a matter on the one hand of the

internal relations of both I and II and on the other of the movement

between them. Since we have assumed that in II likewise one half of

the surplus value is to be accumulated, 188 are to be converted here

into capital, of which one-fifth, or 47, or, to round it off, 48, are to be

variable  capital,  so  that  140  remain  to  be  converted  into  constant

capital.

    Here we come across a new problem, whose very existence must

appear strange to the current view that commodities of one kind are

exchanged for commodities of another kind, or commodities for money

and the same money again for commodities of another kind. The 140

II s can be converted into productive capital only by replacing them

with commodities of Is of the same value. It is a matter of course that

that portion of I s which must be exchanged for IIs must consist of

means of production, which may enter either into the production of

both I and II, or exclusively into that of II. This replacement can be

made feasible only by means of a one-sided purchase on the part of

II,  as  the  entire  surplus  product  of  500  I  s,  which  we  still  have  to

examine,  is  to  serve  the  purposes  of  accumulation  within  I,  hence

cannot be exchanged for commodities II; in other words, it cannot be

simultaneously accumulated and consumed by I. Therefore, II must

buy 140 Is for cash without recovering this money by a subsequent

sale of its commodities to I. And this is a process which is continuallyrepeating  itself  in  every  new  annual  production,  so  far  as  it  is

reproduction on an extended scale. Where in II is the source of the

money for this? [...]

    There seem to be only two ways by which this money can be

withdrawn from circulation to form virtually additional money capital.

Either one part of capitalists II cheats the other and thus robs them of

their money [...]

    Or  a  part  of  II  represented  by  necessities  of  life  is  directly

converted into new variable capital within department II. How that is

done we shall examine at the close of this Chapter (under No. IV).

    1. FIRST ILLUSTRATION

    A. Scheme of Simple Reproduction

    I. 4,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s = 6,000

    II. 2,000c + 500v + 500s = 3,000

    = 9,000 Total

 

    B. Initial Scheme for Reproduction on an Extended Scale

    I. 4,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s = 6,000

    II. 1,500c + 750v + 750s = 3,000

    = 9,000 Total

 

    Assuming that in scheme B one half of surplus value I, i.e., 500, is

accumulated, we first receive (1,000v + 500s) I, or 1,500 I(v + s) to be

replaced by 1,500 IIc. There then remains in I: 4,000c and 500s, the

latter having to be accumulated. The replacement of (1,000v + 500s) I

by  1,500  IIc  is  a  process  of  simple  reproduction,  which  has  been

examined previously.

    Let us now assume that 400 of the 500 Is are to be converted into

constant capital, and 100 into variable capital. The exchange within I

of  the  400s,  which  are  thus  to  be  capitalized,  has  already  been

discussed. They can therefore be annexed to Ic, without more ado

and in that case we get for I:

    4,400c + 1,000v + 100s (the latter to be converted into 100v).

    II in turn buys from I for the purpose of accumulation the 100 Is

(existing in means of production) which now form additional constant

capital II, while the 100 in money which it pays for them are converted

into the money form of the additional variable capital of I. We thenhave for I a capital of 4,400c + 1,100v (the latter in money), equaling

5,500.

    II has now 1,600c for its constant capital. In order to put them to

work, it must advance a further 50v in money for the purchase of new

labor power, so that its variable capital grows from 750 to 800. This

expansion of the constant and variable capital of II by a total of 150 is

supplied  out  of  its  surplus  value.  Hence  only  600s  of  the  750  IIs

remain as a consumption fund for capitalists II, whose annual product

is now distributed as follows:

    II. 1,600c + 800v + 600s (consumption fund), equal to 3,000.

    The 150s produced in articles of consumption, which have been

converted here into (100c + 50v) II, go entirely in their natural form for

the consumption of the laborers, 100 being consumed by the laborers

of I (100 Iv), and 50 by the laborers of II (50 IIv), as explained above.

As a matter of fact, in II, where its total product is prepared in a form

suitable for accumulation, a part greater by 100 of the surplus value in

the form of necessary articles of consumption must be reproduced. If

reproduction  really  starts  on  an  extended  scale,  then  the  100  of

variable money capital I flow back through the hands of its working

class to II, while II transfers 100s in commodity supply to I and at the

same time 50 in commodity supply to its own working class.

    The arrangement changed for the purpose of accumulation is now

as follows:

    I. 4,400c + 1,100v + 500 consumption fund =  6,000

    II. 1,600c + 800v + 600 consumption fund =  3,000

    9,000 Total, as before

    Of these amounts, the following are capital:

    I. 4,400c + 1,100v (money) = 5,500

    II. 1,600c + 800v (money) = 2,400

    7,900

    while production started out with

    I. 4,000c + 1,000v = 5,000

    II.1,500c + 750v =  2,250

    7,250

    Now, if actual accumulation takes place on this basis, that is to

say,  if  production  really  goes  on  with  this  augmented  capital,  we

obtain at the end of the following year:    I. 4,400c + 1,100v + 1,100s =  6,600

    II. 1,600c + 800v + 800s =  3,200

  9,800

    Then let accumulation in I continue in the same proportion, so that

550s are spent as revenue and 550s accumulated. In that case 1,100

Iv are first replaced by 1,100 IIc, and 550 Is must be realized in an

equal amount of commodities of II, making a total of 1,650 I (v + s).

But the constant capital II, which is to be replaced, is equal to only

1,600; hence the remaining 50 must be supplemented out of 800 IIs.

Leaving aside the money aspect for the present, we have as a result

of this transaction:

    I.  4,400c  +  550s  (to  be  capitalized);  furthermore,  realized  in

commodities II c, the consumption fund of the capitalists and laborers

1,650(v + s).

    II. 1,650c (50 added from IIs as indicated above) + 800v + 750s

(consumption fund of the capitalists).

    But if the old ratio of v:s is maintained in II, then additional 25 v

must be laid out for 50c, and these are to be taken from the 750s.

Then we have

    II. 1,650c + 825v + 725s.

    In I, 550s must be capitalized. If the former ratio is maintained,

440  of  this  amount  form  constant  capital  and  110  variable  capital.

These  110  might  be  taken  out  of  the  725  IIs,  i.e.,  articles  of

consumption to the value of 110 are consumed by laborers I instead of

capitalists II, so that the latter are compelled to capitalize these 110s

which they cannot consume. This leaves 615 IIs of the 725 IIs. But if II

thus converts these 110 into additional constant capital, it requires an

additional variable capital of 55. This again must be supplied by its

surplus value. Subtracting this amount from 615 IIs leaves 560 for the

consumption of capitalists II, and we now obtain the following capital

value after accomplishing all actual and potential transfers:

    I. (4,400c + 440c) + (1,100v + 110v) = 4,840c + 1,210v = 6,050

    II. (1,600c + 50c + 110c) + (800v + 25v + 55v) = 1760c + 880v =

2,640/8,690

    If  things  are  to  proceed  normally,  accumulation  in  II  must  take

place more rapidly than in I, because otherwise the portion I(v + s)which must be converted into commodities IIc will grow more rapidly

than IIc, for which alone it can be exchanged.

    If reproduction is continued on this basis and conditions otherwise

remain unchanged we obtain at the end of the succeeding year:

    I. 4,840c + 1,210v + 1,210s =  7,260

    II. 1,760c + 880v + 880s= 3,520

    =  10,780

    If  the  rate  of  division  of  the  surplus  value  remains  unchanged,

there is first to be expended as revenue by I: 1,210v and one half of s,

or 605, a total of 1,815. This consumption fund is again larger than IIc

by  55.  These  55  must  be  deducted  from  880s,  leaving  825.

Furthermore,  the  conversion  of  55  IIs  into  IIc  implies  another

deduction from IIs for a corresponding variable capital of 27, leaving
                                                                              1/2

for consumption 797  IIs.
                          1/2

    It has now to capitalize 605s. Of these 484 are constant and 121

variables. The last named are to be deducted from II s, which is still

equal to 797, leaving 676 IIs. II, then, converts another 121 into
                1/21/2

constant capital and requires another variable capital of 60 for it,
                                                                                1/2

which likewise comes out of 676, leaving 616 for consumption.
                                        1/2

    Then we have the following capital:

    I. Constant: 4,840 + 484 =  5,324

            Variable: 1,210 + 121 =  1,331

    II. Constant: 1,760 + 55 + 121 =  1,936

            Variable: 880 + 27 + 60 =    968
                                      1/21/2

              Totals: I. 5,324c + 1,331v =  6,655

 

    II. 1,936c + 968v = 2,904

  = 9,559

    And at the end of the year the product is

    I. 5,324c + 1,331v + 1,331s =  7,986

    II. 1,936c + 968v + 968s= 3,872

    = 11,858

    Repeating the same calculation and rounding off the fractions, we

get at the end of the succeeding year the following product:

    I. 5,856c + 1,464v + 1,464s = 8,784

    II. 2,129c + 1,065v + 1,065s =  4,259

    =  13,043    And at the end of the next succeeding year:

    I. 6, 442c + 1,610v + 1,610s = 9,662

    II. 2,342c + 1,172v + 1,172s = 4,686

    = 14,348

    In the course of five years of reproduction on an extended scale

the aggregate capital of I and II has risen from 5,500c + 1,750v =

7,250  to  8,784c  +  2,782v  =  11,566;  in  other  words,  in  the  ratio  of

100:160. The total surplus value was originally 1,750; it is now 2,782.

The consumed surplus value was originally 500 for I and 600 for II, a

total of 1,100. The previous year it was 732 for I and 745 for II, a total

of 1,477. It has therefore grown in the ratio of 100:134.

    2. SECOND ILLUSTRATION

    Now  take  the  annual  product  of  9,000,  which  is  altogether  a

commodity capital in the hands of the class of industrial capitalists in a

form in which the general average ratio of the variable to the constant

capital is that of 1:5. This presupposes a considerable development of

capitalist production and accordingly of the productivity of social labor,

a considerable previous increase in the scale of production, and finally

a  development  of  all  the  circumstances  which  produce  a  relative

surplus population among the working class. The annual product will

then be divided as follows, after rounding off the various fractions:

    I. 5,000c + 1,000v + 1,000s = 7,000

    II. 1,430c + 285v + 285s = 2,000

    = 9,000

    Now take it that capitalist class I consumes one half of its surplus

value, or 500, and accumulates the other half. In that case (1,000v +

500s) I, or 1,500, would have to be converted into 1,500 IIc. Since IIc

here amounts to only 1,430, it is necessary to add 70 from the surplus

value. Subtracting this sum from 285 IIs leaves 215 IIs. Then we have:

    I. 5,000c + 500s (to be capitalized) + 1,500(v+s)

    in the consumption fund of the capitalists and laborers.

    II. 1,430c + 70s (to be capitalized) + 285v + 215s

    As 70 IIs are directly annexed here to IIc, a variable capital of

70/5, or 14, is required to set this additional constant capital in motion.

These 14 must also come out of the 215 IIs, so that 201 IIs remain,

and we have:

    II. (1,430c + 70c) + (285v + l4v) + 201s.    The exchange of 1,500 I(v + y2s) for 1,500 IIc is a process of

simple  reproduction,  and  nothing  further  need  be  said  about  it.

However a few peculiarities remain to be noted here, which arise from

the fact that in accumulating reproduction I(v + y2s) is not replaced

solely by IIc, but by IIc plus a portion of IIs.

    It goes without saying that as soon as we assume accumulation, I

(v + s) is greater than IIc, not equal to IIc, as in simple reproduction.

For in the first place, I incorporate a portion of its surplus product in its

own  productive  capital  and  converts  five-sixths  of  it  into  constant

capital, therefore cannot replace these five-sixths simultaneously by

articles of consumption II. In the second place I has to supply out of its

surplus  product  the  material  for  the  constant  capital  required  for

accumulation within II, just as II has to supply I with the material for

the variable capital, which is to set in motion the portion of I’s surplus

product employed by I itself as additional constant capital. We know

that  the  actual,  and  therefore  also  the  additional,  variable  capital

consists of labor power. It is not capitalist I who buys from II a supply

of  necessities  of  life  or  accumulates  them  for  the  additional  labor

power to be employed by him, as the slaveholder had to do. It is the

laborers themselves who trade with II. But this does not prevent the

articles  of  consumption  of  his  additional  labor  power  from  being

viewed by the capitalist as only so many means of production and

maintenance  of  his  eventual  additional  labor  power,  hence  as  the

natural form of his variable capital. His own immediate operation, in

the  present  case  that  of  I,  consists  in  merely  storing  up  the  new

money capital required for the purchase of additional labor power. As

soon as he has incorporated this in his capital, the money becomes a

means of purchase of commodities II for this labor power, which must

find these articles of consumption at hand [...]

    The product of 9,000 in the second illustration must, as we have

seen,  be  distributed  in  the  following  manner  for  the  purpose  of

reproduction,  if  500  Is  is  to  be  capitalized.  In  doing  so  we  merely

consider the commodities and neglect the money circulation.

    I. 5,000c + 500s (to be capitalized) + 1,500(v + s) consumption

fund equals 7,000 in commodities.

    II. 1,500c + 299v + 201s equals 2,000 in commodities.

    Grand total: 9,000 in commodities.    Capitalization takes place in the following manner:

    In I the 500s which are being capitalized divide into five-sixths, or

417c plus one-sixth, or 83v. The 83v draw an equal amount out of IIs,

which buys elements of constant capital and adds them to II c. An

increase of IIc by 83 implies an increase of IIv by one-fifth of 83, or 17.

    We have, then, after this exchange

    I. (5,000c + 417s)c + (1,000v + 83s)v = 5,417c + 1,083v = 6,500

    II.  (1,500c  +  83s)c  +  (299v  +  17s)v  =  1,583c  +  316v  =  1,899

Grand total: 8,399.

    The capital in I has grown from 6,000 to 6,500, or by 1/12. That of

II has grown from 1,715 to 1,899, or by not quite 1/9.

    The  reproduction  on  this  basis  in  the  second  year  brings  the

capital at the end of that year to

    I. (5,417c + 452s)c + (1,083v + 90s)v = 5,869c + 1,173v = 7,042

    II. (1,583c + 42s + 90s)c + (316v + 8s + 18s)v = 1,715c + 342v =

2,057.

    And at the end of the third year, we have a product of

    I. 5,869c + 1,173v + 1,173s

    II. 1,715c + 342v + 342s.

    If I accumulates one half of its surplus value, as before, we find

that I(v + y2S) yields 1,173v + 587(%s), equal to 1,760, more than the

entire 1,715 II c, an excess of 45. This must again be balanced by

transferring an equal amount of means of production to IIc, which thus

grows  by  45,  necessitating  an  addition  of  one-fifth,  or  9,  to  IIv.

Furthermore, the capitalized 587 I s divide into five-sixths and one-

sixth, i.e., 489c and 98v. The 98 imply in II a new addition of 98 to the

constant capital, and this again an increase of variable capital II by

one-fifth, or 20. Then we have:

    243

    I. (5,869c + 489s)c + (1,173v + 98s)v = 6,358s + 1,271v = 7,629

    II. (1,715c + 45s + 98s)c + (342v + 9s + 20s)v = 1,858c + 371v =

2,229 Total capital = 9,858.

    In three years of growing reproduction the total capital of I has

increased from 6,000 to 7,629 and that of II from 1,715 to 2,229, the

aggregate social capital from 7,715 to 9,858.

    3. REPLACEMENT OF IIc IN ACCUMULATION    In the exchange of I(v + s) for IIc we thus meet with various cases.

In simple reproduction both of them must be equal and replace one

another, since otherwise simple reproduction cannot proceed without

disturbance, as we have seen above.

    In accumulation it is above all the rate of accumulation that must

be considered. In the preceding cases we assumed that the rate of

accumulation  in  I  was  equal  to  1/2s  I,  and  also  that  it  remained

constant from year to year. We changed only the proportion in which

this  accumulated  capital  was  divided  into  variable  and  constant

capital. We then had three cases:

    1) I(v + yS) equals IIc, which is therefore smaller than I(v + s).

This must always be so, otherwise I does not accumulate.

    2) I(v + y2S) is greater than IIc. In this case the replacement is

effected by adding a corresponding portion of IIS to IIc, so that this

sum becomes equal to I(v + y2S). Here the replacement for II is not a

simple  reproduction  of  its  constant  capital,  but  accumulation,  an

augmentation  of  its  constant  capital  by  that  portion  of  its  surplus

product  which  it  exchanges  for  means  of  production  of  I.  This

augmentation implies at the same time a corresponding addition to

variable capital II out of its own surplus product.

    3)  I(v  +  y2S)  is  smaller  than  IIc.  In  this  case  II  does  not  fully

reproduce its constant capital by means of exchange and must make

good the deficit by purchase from I. But this does not entail any further

accumulation of variable capital II, since its constant capital is fully

reproduced  only  by  this  operation.  On  the  other  hand,  that  part  of

capitalists  I  who  accumulate  only  additional  money  capital,  have

already  accomplished  a  portion  of  this  accumulation  by  this

transaction.

    The premise of simple reproduction, that I (v + S) is equal to II c,

is not only incompatible with capitalist production, although this does

not exclude the possibility that in an industrial cycle of 10-11 years

some year may show a smaller total production than the preceding

year, so that not even simple reproduction takes place compared to

the  preceding  year.  Besides  that,  considering  the  natural  annual

increase in population simple reproduction could take place only to the

extent that a correspondingly larger number of unproductive servants

would partake of the 1,500 representing the aggregate surplus value.But  accumulation  of  capital,  real  capitalist  production,  would  be

impossible  under  such  circumstances.  The  fact  of  capitalist

accumulation therefore excludes the possibility of IIc being equal to I(v

+ s). Nevertheless it might occur even with capitalist accumulation that

in consequence of the course taken by the processes of accumulation

during a preceding series of periods of production IIc might become

not  only  equal  but  even  bigger  than  I(v  +  s).  This  would  mean  an

overproduction in II and could not be adjusted in any other way than

by a great crash, in consequence of which some capital of II would get

transferred to I [...]

    It must be noted that in this exposition of accumulation the value

of the constant capital is not presented accurately so far as that capital

is a part of the value of the commodity capital it helped to produce.

The fixed portion of the newly accumulated constant capital enters into

the commodity capital only gradually and periodically, according to the

different  natures  of  these  fixed  elements.  Therefore,  whenever  raw

materials, semi-finished goods, etc., enter in huge quantities into the

production  of  commodities,  the  commodity  capital  consists  for  the

most part of replacements of the circulating constant components and

of  the  variable  capital.  (On  account  of  the  specific  turnover  of  the

circulating  component  parts  this  way  of  presenting  the  matter  may

nevertheless  be  adopted.  It  is  then  assumed  that  the  circulating

portion  together  with  the  portion  of  value  of  the  fixed  capital

transferred  to  it  is  turned  over  so  often  during  the  year  that  the

aggregate sum of the commodities supplied is equal in value to all the

capital  entering  into  the  annual  production.)  But  wherever  only

auxiliary  materials  are  used  for  mechanical  industry,  and  no  raw

material, there the labor element, equal to v, must reappear in the

commodity capital as its larger constituent. While in the calculation of

the  rate  of  profit  the  surplus  value  is  figured  on  the  total  capital,

regardless of whether the fixed components periodically transfer much

or little value to the product, the fixed portion of constant capital is to

be included in the calculation of the value of any periodically created

commodity capital only to the extent that on an average it yields value

to the product on account of wear and tear.    IV. Supplementary Remarks


    The original source of the money for II is v + s of the gold industry

I exchanged for a part of IIc. The v + s of the producer of gold does

not enter into II only to the extent that he accumulates surplus value or

converts  it  into  means  of  production  I,  i.e.,  to  the  extent  that  he

expands his production. On the other hand, since the accumulation of

money  on  the  part  of  the  gold  producer  himself  leads  ultimately  to

reproduction on an extended scale, a portion of the surplus value of

gold production not spent as revenue passes as additional variable

capital of the gold producer into II, promotes here the formation of new

hoards or supplies new means with which to buy from I without selling

to it direct. From the money derived from this I(v + s) of the production

of  gold  that  portion  of  the  gold  must  be  deducted  which  certain

branches of production II need as raw material, etc., in short as an

element for the replacement of their constant capital. An element for

the  preliminary  formation  of  hoards  —  for  the  purpose  of  future

extended reproduction — exists in the exchange between I and II: for I

only if part of Is is sold one-sidedly, without a balancing purchase, to II

and  serves  there  as  additional  constant  capital  II;  for  II,  when  the

same  is  the  case  on  the  part  of  I  for  additional  variable  capital;

furthermore, if a part of the surplus value spent by I as revenue is not

covered by IIc, hence a part of IIs is bought with it and thus converted

into money. If I(v + s/x) is greater than IIc, then IIc need not for its

simple reproduction replace in commodities from I what I consumed

out of IIs. The question arises to what extent hoarding can take place

within the sphere of exchange of capitalists II among themselves, an

exchange  which  can  consist  only  of  a  mutual  exchange  of  IIs.  We

know  that  direct  accumulation  takes  place  within  II  by  the  direct

conversion of a portion of IIs into variable capital (just as in I a portion

of  Is  is  directly  converted  into  constant  capital).  In  the  various  age

categories of accumulation within the various lines of business of II,

and for the individual capitalists in each line of business, the matter is

explained mutatis mutandis in the same way as in I. Some are still in

the stage of hoarding, and sell without buying; the others are on the

point of actual expansion of reproduction, and buy without selling. The

additional  variable  money  capital  is,  true  enough,  first  invested  inadditional labor power, but this buys means of subsistence from the

hoarding owners of the additional articles of consumption entering into

the consumption of the laborers. From these owners, pro rata to their

hoard formation, the money does not return to its point of departure.

They hoard it [...]        BOOK 3: THE PROCESS OF CAPITALIST

                  PRODUCTION AS A WHOLE      PART 1: THE CONVERSION OF SURPLUS VALUE

INTO PROFIT AND OF THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE

                      INTO THE RATE OF PROFIT                          Chapter 1: Cost Price and Profit



    In  Book  I  we  analyzed  the  phenomena  which  constitute  the

capitalist process of production as such, as the immediate productive

process, with no regard for any of the secondary effects of outside

influences. But this immediate process of production does not exhaust

the life span of capital. It is supplemented in the actual world by the

process of circulation, which was the object of study in Book II. In the

latter, namely in Part III, which treated the process of circulation as a

medium for the process of social reproduction, it developed that the

capitalist  process  of  production  taken  as  a  whole  represents  a

synthesis of the processes of production and circulation. Considering

what this third book treats, it cannot confine itself to general reflection

relative to this synthesis. On the contrary, it must locate and describe

the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a

whole. In their actual movement capitals confront each other in such

concrete shape, for which the form of capital in the immediate process

of production, just as its form in the process of circulation, appear only

as special instances. The various forms of capital, as evolved in this

book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the

surface of society, in the action of different capitals upon one another,

in  competition,  and  in  the  ordinary  consciousness  of  the  agents  of

production themselves.

    The value of every commodity produced in the capitalist way is

represented in the formula: C = c + v + s. If we subtract surplus values

from this value of the product there remains a bare equivalent or a

substitute value in goods, for the capital value c + v expended in the

elements of production.

    For example, if the production of a certain article requires a capital

outlay of £500, of which £20 are for the wear and tear of instruments

of production, £380 for the materials of production, and £100 for labor

power, and if the rate of surplus value is 100%, then the value of the

product = 400c + 100v + 100s = £600.

    After  deducting  the  surplus  value  of  £100,  there  remains  a

commodity value of £500 which only replaces the expended capital of£500. This portion of the value of the commodity, which replaces the

price  of  the  consumed  means  of  production  and  labor  power,  only

replaces what the commodity costs the capitalist himself. For him it,

therefore, represents the cost price of the commodity.

    What the commodity costs the capitalist and its actual production

cost are two quite different magnitudes. That portion of the commodity

value  making  up  the  surplus  value  does  not  cost  the  capitalist

anything simply because it costs the laborer unpaid labor. Yet, on the

basis of capitalist production, after the laborer enters the production

process he himself constitutes an ingredient of operating productive

capital, which belongs to the capitalist. Therefore, the capitalist is the

actual producer of the commodity. For this reason, the cost price of

the commodity necessarily appears to the capitalist as the actual cost

of the commodity. If we take k to be the cost price, the formula C = c +

v + s turns into the formula C = k + s, that is, the commodity value =

cost price + surplus value.

    The grouping of the various value portions of a commodity which

only replace the value of the capital expended in its production under

the  head  of  cost  price  expresses,  on  the  one  hand,  the  specific

character of capitalist production. The capitalist cost of the commodity

is measured by the expenditure of capital, while the actual cost of the

commodity  is  measured  by  the  expenditure  of  labor.  Thus,  the

capitalist cost price of the commodity differs in quantity from its value,

or its actual cost price. It is smaller than the value of the commodity,

because, with C = k + s, it is evident that k = C - s. On the other hand,

the cost price of a commodity is by no means simply a category which

exists  only  in  capitalist  bookkeeping.  The  individualization  of  this

portion  of  value  is  continually  manifest  in  practice  in  the  actual

production of the commodity, because it has ever to be reconverted

from its commodity form by way of the process of circulation into the

form  of  productive  capital,  so  that  the  cost  price  of  the  commodity

always must repurchase the elements of production consumed in its

manufacture.

    The category of cost price, on the other hand, has nothing to do

with the formation of commodity value, or with the process of self-

expansion of capital. When I know that of the value of a commodity

worth £600, five-sixths, or £500, represent no more than an equivalentof  the  capital  of  £500  consumed  in  its  production  and  that  it  can

therefore  suffice  only  to  repurchase  the  material  elements  of  this

capital, I know nothing as yet either of the way in which these five-

sixths of the value of the commodity, which represent its cost price,

are  produced,  or  about  the  way  in  which  the  last  sixth,  which

constitutes  its  surplus  value,  was  produced.  The  investigation  will

show, however, that in capitalist economics the cost price assumes

the false appearance of a category of value production itself.

    To return to our example. Suppose the value produced by one

laborer  during  an  average  social  working  day  is  represented  by  a

money sum of 6s. = 6M. Then the advanced capital of £500 = 400c +

100v represents a value produced in 1,666% ten-hour working days,

of  which  1,333%  working  days  are  crystallized  in  the  value  of  the

means of production = 400c, and 333% are crystallized in the value of

labor power = 100v. Having assumed a rate of surplus value of 100%,

the production of the commodity to be newly formed entails a labor

expenditure = 100v + 100s = 666% ten-hour working days.

    We know [...] that the value of the newly created product of £600

is  composed  of  1)  the  reappearing  value  of  the  constant  capital  of

£400 expended for means of production, and 2) a newly produced

value of £200. The cost price of the commodity = £500 comprises the

reappearing 400c and one-half of the newly produced value of £200 (=

100v),  that  is,  two  elements  of  the  commodity  value  which  are  of

entirely different origin [...]

    The fact that the various components of the value of the advanced

capital  have  been  expended  for  materially  different  elements  of

production, namely for instruments of labor, raw materials, auxiliary

materials, and labor, requires only that the cost price of the commodity

must buy back these materially different elements of production. So

far as the formation of the cost price is concerned, however, only one

distinction is appreciable, namely that between fixed and circulating

capital. In our example we have set down £20 for wear and tear of

instruments of labor (400c = £20 for depreciation of instruments of

labor  +  £380  for  materials  of  production).  Before  the  productive

process the value of these instruments of labor was, say, £1,200. After

the commodities have been produced it exists in two forms, the £20 as

part of the value of the commodity, and 1,200 - 20, or £1,180, as theremaining value of the instruments of labor which, as before, are in the

possession  of  the  capitalist;  in  other  words,  as  an  element  of  his

productive, not of his commodity capital. Materials of production and

wages, as distinct from means of labor, are entirely consumed in the

production of the commodity and thus their entire value goes into that

of  the  produced  commodity.  We  have  seen  how  these  various

components of the advanced capital assume the forms of fixed and

circulating capital in relation to the turnover.

    Accordingly, the capital advanced = £1,680: fixed capital = £1,200

+ circulating capital = £480 (= £380 in materials of production plus

£100 in wages).

    But the cost price of the commodity only = £500 (£20 for the wear

and tear of the fixed capital, and £480 for circulating capital) [...]

    So  far  we  have  considered  just  one  element  of  the  value  of

commodities, namely the cost price. We must now turn also to the

other component of the value of commodities, namely the excess over

the cost price, or the surplus value. In the first place, then, surplus

value  is  the  excess  value  of  a  commodity  over  and  above  its  cost

price.  But  since  the  cost  price  equals  the  value  of  the  consumed

capital, into whose material elements it is continually reconverted, this

excess value is an accretion in the value of the capital expended in

the  production  of  the  commodity  and  returning  by  way  of  its

circulation.

    However, surplus value forms an increment not only of the portion

of the advanced capital which goes into the self-expansion process,

but also of the portion which does not go into it. In other words, it is an

accretion not only to the consumed capital made good out of the cost

price of the commodity, but to all the capital invested in production.

Before  the  production  process  we  had  a  capital  valued  at  £1,680,

namely £1,200 of fixed capital invested in means of production, only

£20 of which go into the value of the commodity for wear and tear,

plus £480 of circulating capital in materials of production and wages.

After  the  production  process  we  have  £1,180  as  the  constituent

element of the value of the productive capital plus a commodity capital

of £600. By adding these two sums of value we find that the capitalist

now has a value of £1,780. After deducting his advanced total capital

of  £1,680  there  remains  a  value  increment  of  £100.  The  £100  ofsurplus value thus form as much of an increment in relation to the

invested £1,680 as to its fraction of £500 expended during production

[... To the capitalist, the] surplus value seems to spring equally from all

its different elements of value consisting of means of production and

labor. For all these elements contribute equally to the formation of the

cost price [...] In its assumed capacity of offspring of the aggregate

advanced  capital,  surplus  value  takes  the  converted  form  of  profit.

Hence, a certain value is capital when it is invested with a view to

producing  profit,  or,  there  is  profit  because  a  certain  value  was

employed as capital. Suppose profit is p. Then the formula C = c + v +

s = k + s turns into the formula C = k + p, or the value of a commodity

= cost price + profit. The profit, such as it is represented here, is thus

the same as surplus value, only in a mystified form [...]

    We have seen that the cost price of a commodity is smaller than

its value. Since C = k + s, it follows that k = C - s. The formula C = k +

s reduces itself to C = k, or commodity value = commodity cost price

only  if  s  =  0,  a  case  which  never  occurs  on  the  basis  of  capitalist

production,  although  peculiar  market  conditions  may  reduce  the

selling price of commodities to the level of, or even below, their cost

price.

    Hence, if a commodity is sold at its value, a profit is realized which

is equal to the excess of its value over its cost price, and therefore

equal  to  the  entire  surplus  value  incorporated  in  the  value  of  the

commodity. But the capitalist may sell a commodity at a profit even

when he sells it below its value. So long as its selling price is higher

than its cost price, though it may be lower than its value, a portion of

the  surplus  value  incorporated  in  it  is  always  realized,  thus  always

yielding  a  profit  [...]  The  minimal  limit  of  the  selling  price  of  a

commodity  is  its  cost  price.  If  it  is  sold  under  its  cost  price,  the

expended constituent elements of productive capital cannot be fully

replaced out of the selling price. If this process continues, the value of

the advanced capital disappears [...]                            Chapter 2: The Rate of Profit



    [...] The surplus value, whatever its origin, is thus a surplus over

the advanced total capital. The proportion of this surplus to the total

capital is therefore expressed by the fraction s/C, in which C stands

for  total  capital.  We  thus  obtain  the  rate  of  profit  s/C  =  s/(c+v),  as

distinct from the rate of surplus value s/v. The rate of surplus value

measured against the variable capital is called rate of surplus value.

The rate of surplus value measured against the total capital is called

rate of profit. These are two different measurements of the same entity

[...]

    The transformation of surplus value into profit must be deduced

from the transformation of the rate of surplus value into the rate of

profit, not vice versa. And in fact it was rate of profit which was the

historical point of departure. Surplus value and rate of surplus value

are,  relatively,  the  invisible  and  unknown  essence  that  wants

investigating,  while  rate  of  profit  and  therefore  the  appearance  of

surplus value in the form of profit are revealed on the surface of the

phenomenon.  So  far  as  the  individual  capitalist  is  concerned,  it  is

evident that he is only interested in the relation of the surplus value, or

the excess value at which he sells his commodities, to the total capital

advanced  for  the  production  of  the  commodities,  while  the  specific

relationship  and  inner  connection  of  this  surplus  with  the  various

components of capital fail to interest him, and it is, moreover, rather in

his interests to draw the veil over this specific relationship and this

intrinsic connection [...]

    Although the excess value of a commodity over its cost price is

shaped in the immediate process of production, it is realized only in

the process of circulation, and appears all the more readily to have

arisen  from  the  process  of  circulation,  since  in  reality,  under

competition,  in  the  actual  market,  it  depends  on  market  conditions

whether or not and to what extent this surplus is realized. There is no

need to waste words at this point about the fact that if a commodity issold above or below its value, there is merely another kind of division

of  surplus  value,  and  that  this  different  division,  this  changed

proportion in which various persons share in the surplus value, does

not in any way alter either the magnitude or the nature of that surplus

value [...]

    If the rate of surplus value is known and its magnitude given, the

rate  of  profit  expresses  nothing  but  what  it  actually  is,  namely  a

different way of measuring surplus value, its measurement according

to the value of the total capital instead of the value of the portion of

capital  from  which  surplus  value  directly  originates  by  way  of  its

exchange for labor [...] What the rate of profit actually shows is rather

a uniform relation of the surplus to equal portions of the total capital,

which, from this point of view, does not show any inner difference at

all, unless it be between the fixed and circulating capital. And it shows

this  difference,  too,  only  because  the  surplus  is  calculated  in  two

ways; namely, first, as a simple magnitude — as excess over the cost

price. In this, its initial, form, the entire circulating capital goes into the

cost price, while of the fixed capital only the wear and tear goes into it.

Second, the relation of this excess in value to the total value of the

advanced  capital.  In  this  case,  the  value  of  the  total  fixed  capital

enters into the calculation, quite the same as the circulating capital.

Therefore, the circulating capital goes in both times in the same way,

while the fixed capital goes in differently the first time, and in the same

way as circulating capital the second time. Under the circumstances

the  difference  between  fixed  and  circulating  capital  is  the  only  one

which obtrudes itself [...]

    Although the rate of profit thus differs numerically from the rate of

surplus  value,  while  surplus  value  and  profit  are  actually  the  same

thing and numerically equal, profit is nevertheless a converted form of

surplus value, a form in which its origin and the secret of its existence

are obscured and extinguished [...]      Chapter 3: The Relation of the Rate of Profit to The Rate of

                                    Surplus Value



    Here, as at the close of the preceding Chapter, and generally in

this entire first part, we presume the amount of profit falling to a given

capital to be equal to the total amount of surplus value produced by

means of this capital during a certain period of circulation. We thus

leave aside for the present the fact that, on the one hand, this surplus

value may be broken up into various sub-forms, such as interest on

capital, ground rent, taxes, etc., and that, on the other, it is not, as a

rule, identical with profit as appropriated by virtue of a general rate of

profit, which will be discussed in the second part.

    So far as the quantity of profit is assumed to be equal to that of

surplus  value,  its  magnitude,  and  that  of  the  rate  of  profit,  is

determined by ratios of simple figures given or ascertainable in every

individual case. The analysis, therefore, first is carried on purely in the

mathematical field.

    We retain the designations used in Books I and II. Total capital C

consists of constant capital c and variable capital v, and produces a

surplus  value  s.  The  ratio  of  this  surplus  value  to  the  advanced

variable  capital,  or  s/v,  is  called  the  rate  of  surplus  value  and

designated s'. Therefore, s/v = s', and consequently s = s'v. If this

surplus  value  is  related  to  the  total  capital  instead  of  the  variable

capital, it is called profit, p, and the ratio of the surplus value s to the

total capital C, or s/C, is called the rate of profit, p'. Accordingly, p' =

s/C = s/(c + v)

    Now, substituting for s its equivalent s'v, we find p’ = s’ (v/C) = s’

v/(c + v)

    which equation may also be expressed by the proportion p’ : s’ = v

: C ; the rate of profit is related to the rate of surplus value as the

variable capital is to the total capital.

    It follows from this proportion that the rate of profit, p', is always

smaller  than  s',  the  rate  of  surplus  value,  because  v,  the  variablecapital, is always smaller than C, the sum of v + c, or the variable plus

the constant capital; the only, practically impossible case excepted, in

which v = C, that is, no constant capital at all, no means of production,

but only wages are advanced by the capitalist.

    However, our analysis also considers a number of other factors

which have a determining influence on the magnitude of c, v, and s,

and must therefore be briefly examined.

    First, the value of money. We may assume this to be constant

throughout.

    Second,  the  turnover.  We  shall  leave  this  factor  entirely  out  of

consideration for the present, since its influence on the rate of profit

will be treated specially in a later Chapter. [Here we anticipate just one

point, that the formula p’ = s’ (v/C) is strictly correct only for one period

of turnover of the variable capital. But we may correct it for an annual

turnover by substituting for the simple rate of surplus value, s’, the

annual rate of surplus value, s’n. In this, n is the number of turnovers

of the variable capital within one year [...]

    Third, due consideration must be given to productivity of labor,

whose  influence  on  the  rate  of  surplus  value  has  been  thoroughly

discussed in Book I [...] Productivity of labor may also exert a direct

influence on the rate of profit, at least of an individual capital, if, as has

been demonstrated in Book I [, ...] this individual capital operates with

a  higher  than  the  average  social  productivity  and  produces

commodities at a lower value than their average social value, thereby

realizing an extra profit. However, this case will not be considered for

the present, since in this part of the work we also proceed from the

premise  that  commodities  are  produced  under  normal  social

conditions and are sold at their values. Hence, we assume in each

case that the productivity of labor remains constant. In effect, the day

laborer of a capital invested in a branch of industry, that is, a certain

proportion  between  the  variable  and  constant  capital,  always

expresses a definite degree of labor productivity. As soon, therefore,

as this proportion is altered by means other than a mere change in the

value of the material elements of the constant capital, or a change in

wages,  the  productivity  of  labor  must  likewise  undergo  a

corresponding change, and we shall often enough see, for this reason,that  changes  in  the  factors  c,  v,  and  s  also  imply  changes  in  the

productivity of labor.

    The same applies to the three remaining factors — the length of

the working day, intensity of labor, and wages. Their influence on the

quantity and rate of surplus value has been exhaustively discussed in

Book I [...] It will be understood, therefore, that notwithstanding the

assumption, which we make for the sake of simplicity, that these three

factors  remain  constant,  the  changes  that  occur  in  v  and  s  may

nevertheless  imply  changes  in  the  magnitude  of  these,  their

determining elements. In this respect we must briefly recall that the

wage influences the quantity of surplus value and the rate of surplus

value in inverse proportion to the length of the working day and the

intensity of labor; that an increase in wages reduces the surplus value,

while a lengthening of the working day and an increase in the intensity

of labor add to it.

    Suppose  a  capital  of  100  produces  a  surplus  value  of  20

employing 20 laborers working a 10-hour day for a total weekly wage

of 20. Then we have:

    80c + 20v + 20s; s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%.

    Now the working day is lengthened to 15 hours without raising the

wages.  The  total  value  produced  by  the  20  laborers  will  thereby

increase from 40 to 60 (10: 15 = 40: 60). Since v, the wages paid to

the laborers, remains the same, the surplus value rises from 20 to 40,

and we have:

    80c + 20v + 40s; s’ = 200%, p’ = 40%.

    If,  conversely,  the  ten-hour  working  day  remains  unchanged,

while wages fall from 20 to 12, the total value product amounts to 40

as  before,  but  is  differently  distributed;  v  falls  to  12,  leaving  a

remainder of 28 for s. Then we have:

    80c + 12v + 28s; s’ = 2331/3%, p’ = 28/92 = 30 10/23 %.

    Hence, we see that a prolonged working day (or a corresponding

increase in the intensity of labor) and a fall in wages both increase the

amount,  and  thus  the  rate,  of  surplus  value.  Conversely,  a  rise  in

wages, other things being equal, would lower the rate of surplus value.

Hence,  if  v  rises  through  a  rise  in  wages,  it  does  not  express  a

greater, but only a dearer quantity of labor, in which case s’ and p’ do

not rise, but fall.    This indicates that changes in the working day, intensity of labor

and wages cannot take place without a simultaneous change in v and

s and their ratio, and therefore also p’, which is the ratio of s to the

total capital c + v. And it is also evident that changes in the ratio of s to

v also imply corresponding changes in at least one of the three above-

mentioned labor conditions [...]

    Let us now go on to apply the above-mentioned equation of the

rate of profit, p’ = s’ (v/C), to the various possible cases. We shall

successively change the value of the individual factors of s’ (v/C) and

determine the effect of these changes on the rate of profit. In this way

we shall obtain different series of cases, which we may regard either

as successive altered conditions of operation for one and the same

capital, or as different capitals existing side by side and introduced for

the sake of comparison, taken, as it were, from different branches of

industry or different countries [...]

    Hence, we now separate the product s’ (v/C) into its two factors s’

and v/C. At first we shall treat s’ as constant and analyses the effect of

the possible variations of v/C. After that we shall treat the fraction v/C

as constant and let s’ pass through its possible variations. Finally, we

shall treat all factors as variable magnitudes and thereby exhaust all

the  cases  from  which  laws  concerning  the  rate  of  profit  may  be

derived.

    I. s' CONSTANT, v/C VARIABLE

    This case, which embraces a number of subordinate cases, may

be covered by a general formula. Take two capitals, C and Cx, with

their respective variable components, v and vx, with a common rate of

surplus value, s’, and rates of profit p’ and p’1. Then: p’ = s’ (v/C); p’i =

s’ (vi/Ci)

    Now let us make a proportion of C and C1, and of v and v1. For

instance, let the value of the fraction Cx/C = E, and that of vx/v = e.

Then C1 = EC, and v1 = ev. Substituting in the above equation these

values for p1, C1 and v1, we obtain p’1 = s’ ev/EC

    Again,  we  may  derive  a  second  formula  from  the  above  two

equations by transforming them into the proportion: p’ : p’1 = s’ (v/C) :

s’ (v1/C1) = (v/C) : v1/C1 .

    Since the value of a fraction is not changed if we multiply or divide

its numerator and denominator by the same number, we may reducev/C and v1/C1 to percentages, that is, we may make C and C1 both =

100. Then we have v/C = v/100 and v1/C1 = v1/100, and may then

drop the denominators in the above proportion, obtaining: p’: p’1 = v:

v1’, or:

    Taking any two capitals operating with the same rate of surplus

value, the rates of profit are to each other as the variable portions of

the  capitals  calculated  as  percentages  of  their  respective  total

capitals.

    These two formulas embrace all the possible variations of v/C.

    One more remark before we analyses these various cases singly.

Since C is the sum of c and v, of the constant and variable capitals,

and  since  the  rates  of  surplus  value,  as  of  profit,  are  usually

expressed in percentages, it is convenient to assume that the sum of c

+ v is also equal to 100, i.e., to express c and v in percentages. For

the  determination  of  the  rate  of  profit,  if  not  of  the  amount,  it  is

immaterial whether we say that a capital of 15,000, of which 12,000 is

constant and 3,000 is variable, produces a surplus value of 3,000, or

whether we reduce this capital to percentages:

    15.000 C = 12,000c + 3,000v ( + 3,000s)

    100 C = 80c + 20v ( + 20s).

    In either case the rate of surplus value s’ = 100%, and the rate of

profit = 20%.

    The  same  is  true  when  we  compare  two  capitals,  say,  the

foregoing capital with another, such as

    12.000 C = 10,800c + 1,200v ( + 1,200s)

    100 C = 90c + 10v ( + 10s).

    in  both  of  which  s’  =  100%,  p’  =  10%,  and  in  which  the

comparison with the foregoing capital is clearer in percentage form.

    On the other hand, if it is a matter of changes taking place in one

and the same capital, the form of percentages is rarely to be used,

because  it  almost  always  obscures  these  changes.  If  a  capital

expressed in the form of percentages:

    80c + 20v + 20s

    assumes the form of percentages:

    90c + 10v + 10s,

    we cannot tell whether the changed composition in percentages,

90v + 10c, is due to an absolute decrease of v or an absolute increaseof c, or to both. We would need the absolute magnitudes in figures to

ascertain  this.  In  the  analysis  of  the  following  individual  cases  of

variation, however, everything depends on how these changes have

come about; whether 80v + 20c changed into 90c + 10v through an

increase of the constant capital without any change in the variable

capital, for instance through 12,000c + 3,000v changing into 27,000c +

3,000v (corresponding to a percentage of 90c + 10v); or whether they

took  this  form  through  a  reduction  of  the  variable  capital,  with  the

constant capital remaining unchanged, that is, through a change into

12,000c + 1,333v (also corresponding to a percentage of 90c + 10v);
                    1/3

or, lastly, whether both of the terms changed into 13,500c + 1,500v

(corresponding once more to a percentage of 90c + 10v). But it is

precisely these cases which we shall have to successively analyse,

and in so doing dispense with the convenient form of percentages, or

at least employ these only as a secondary alternative.

    1) s' and C constant, v variable.

    If v changes in magnitude, C can remain unaltered only if c, the

other component of C, that is, the constant capital, changes by the

same amount as v, but in the opposite direction.

    If C originally = 80c + 20v = 100, and if v is then reduced to 10,

then  C  can  =  100  only  if  c  is  increased  to  90;  90c  +  10v  =  100.

Generally speaking, if v is transformed into v ± d, into v increased or

decreased by d, then c must be transformed into c ± d, into c varying

by  the  same  amount,  but  in  the  opposite  direction,  so  that  the

conditions of the present case are satisfied.

    Similarly, if the rate of surplus value s’ remains the same, while

the variable capital v changes, the amount of surplus value s must

change, since s = s’v, and since one of the factors of s’v, namely v, is

given another value.

    The  assumptions  of  the  present  case  produce,  alongside  the

original equation, p’ = s’ (v/C),

    still another equation through the variation of v: p’1 = s’ (v1/C)

    in which v has become v1 and p’1, the resultant changed rate of

profit, is to be found.

    It is determined by the following proportion: p’ : p’1 = s’ (v/C) : s’

(v1/C) = v : v1    Or: with the rate of surplus value and total capital remaining the

same, the original rate of profit is to the new rate of profit produced by

a change in the variable capital as the original variable capital is to the

changed variable capital.

    If the original capital was, as above:

    I. 15,000 C = 12,000c + 3,000v ( + 3,000s), and if it is now:

    II. 15,000 C = 13,000c + 2,000v ( + 2,000s), then C = 15,000 and

s’ = 100% in either case, and the rate of profit of I, 20%, is to that of II,

13/%, as the variable capital of I, 3,000, is to that of II, 2,000, i. e.,

20% : 13/% = 3,000 : 2,000.

    Now, the variable capital may either rise or fall. Let us first take an

example in which it rises. Let a certain capital be originally constituted

and employed as follows:

    I. 100c + 20v + 10s; C = 120, s’ = 50%, p’ = 81/3%.

    Now let the variable capital rise to 30. In that case, according to

our assumption, the constant capital must fall from 100 to 90 so that

total  capital  remains  unchanged  at  120.  The  rate  of  surplus  value

remaining constant at 50%, the surplus value produced will then rise

from 10 to 15. We shall then have:

    II. 90c + 30v + 15s; C = 120, s’ = 50%, p’ = 12%.
                                                                1/2

    Let  us  first  proceed  from  the  assumption  that  wages  remain

unchanged. Then the other factors of the rate of surplus value, i.e., the

working day and the intensity of labor, must also remain unchanged.

In that event the rise of v (from 20 to 30) can signify only that another

half as many laborers are employed. Then the total value produced

also rises one-half, from 30 to 45, and is distributed, just as before, %

for  wages  and  V  for  surplus  value.  But  at  the  same  time,  with  the

increase in the number of laborers, the constant capital, the value of

the means of production, has fallen from 100 to 90. We have, then, a

case of decreasing productivity of labor combined with a simultaneous

shrinkage of constant capital. Is such a case economically possible?

    In agriculture and the extractive industries, in which a decrease in

labor  productivity  and,  therefore,  an  increase  in  the  number  of

employed  laborers  is  quite  comprehensible,  this  process  is  on  the

basis  and  within  the  scope  of  capitalist  production  attended  by  an

increase, instead of a decrease, of constant capital. Even if the above

fall of c were due merely to a fall in prices, an individual capital wouldbe  able  to  accomplish  the  transition  from  I  to  II  only  under  very

exceptional  circumstances.  But  in  the  case  of  two  independent

capitals  invested  in  different  countries,  or  in  different  branches  of

agriculture  or  extractive  industry,  it  would  be  nothing  out  of  the

ordinary  if  in  one  of  the  cases  more  laborers  (and  therefore  more

variable  capital)  were  employed  and  worked  with  less  valuable  or

scantier means of production than in the other case.

    But let us drop the assumption that the wage remains the same,

and let us explain the rise of the variable capital from 20 to 30 through

a rise of wages by one-half. Then we shall have an entirely different

case. The same number of laborers — say, twenty — continue to work

with  the  same  or  only  slightly  reduced  means  of  production.  If  the

working day remains unchanged — say, 10 hours — then the total

value produced also remains unchanged. It was and remains = 30.

But all of this 30 is now required to make good the advanced variable

capital of 30; the surplus value would disappear. We have assumed,

however, that the rate of surplus value should remain constant, that is,

the same as in I, at 50%. This is possible only if the working day is

prolonged  by  one-half  to  15  hours.  Then  the  20  laborers  would

produce a total value of 45 in 15 hours, and all conditions would be

satisfied:

    II. 90c + 30v + 15s; C = 120, s’ = 50%, p’ = 12%.
                                                                1/2

    In this case, the 20 laborers do not require any more means of

labor, tools, machines, etc., than in case I. Only the raw materials or

auxiliary  materials  would  have  to  be  increased  by  one-half.  In  the

event of a fall in the prices of these materials, the transition from I to II

might be more possible economically, even for an individual capital in

keeping with our assumption. And the capitalist would be somewhat

compensated by increased profits for any loss incurred through the

depreciation of his constant capital.

    Now let us assume that the variable capital falls, instead of rising.

Then we have but to reverse our example, taking II as the original

capital, and passing from II to I.

    II. 90c + 30v + 15s, then changes into

    I. 100c + 20v + 10s, and it is evident that this transposition does

not in the least alter any of the conditions regulating the respective

rates of profit and their mutual relation.    If v falls from 30 to 20 because / fewer laborers are employed with

the growing constant capital, then we have before us the normal case

of modern industry, namely, an increasing productivity of labor, and

the  operation  of  a  larger  quantity  of  means  of  production  by  fewer

laborers.  That  this  movement  is  necessarily  connected  with  a

simultaneous drop in the rate of profit will be developed in the third

part of this book.

    If, on the other hand, v falls from 30 to 20, because the same

number  of  laborers  is  employed  at  lower  wages,  the  total  value

produced would, with the working day unchanged, as before = 30v +

15s = 45. Since v fell to 20, the surplus value would rise to 25, the rate

of surplus value from 50% to 125%, which would be contrary to our

assumption. To comply with the conditions of our case, the surplus

value, with its rate at 50%, must rather fall to 10, and the total value

produced must, therefore, fall from 45 to 30, and this is possible only if

the working day is reduced by /. Then, as before, we have:

    100c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 81/3%.

    It need hardly be said that this reduction of the working time, in

the case of a fall in wages, would not occur in practice. But that is

immaterial.  The  rate  of  profit  is  a  function  of  several  variable

magnitudes, and if we wish to know how these variables influence the

rate of profit, we must analyses the individual effect of each in turn,

regardless  of  whether  such  an  isolated  effect  is  economically

practicable with one and the same capital [...]

    2) s' constant, v variable, C changes through the variation of v.

    [...]

    3) s' and v constant, c and therefore C variable.

    [...]

    4) s' constant, v, c and C all variable.

    [...]

    We have herewith exhausted all the possible cases of variation of

v, c, and C in our equation. We have seen that the rate of profit may

fall, remain unchanged, or rise, while the rate of surplus value remains

the same, with the least change in the proportion of v to c or to C,

being sufficient to change the rate of profit as well.

    We  have  seen,  furthermore,  that  in  variations  of  v  there  is  a

certain limit everywhere beyond which it is economically impossible fors’ to remain constant. Since every one-sided variation of c must also

reach a certain limit where v can no longer remain unchanged, we find

that there are limits for every possible variation of v/C, beyond which

s’ must likewise become variable. In the variations of s’ which we shall

now discuss, this interaction of the different variables of our equation

will stand out still clearer.

    II. s' VARIABLE

    We obtain a general formula for the rates of profit with different

rates of surplus value, no matter whether v/C remains constant or not,

by converting the equation: p’ = s’ (v/C) into

    p’i = s’i (vi/Ci),

    in which p’i, s’i, v1 and C1 denote the changed values of p’, s’, v

and C. Then we have:

    p’ : p’i = s’i (v/C) : s’i (vi/Ci) , and hence:

    p’i = (s’i/si) x vi/v x C/Ci x p’. 1

    1) s' variable, v/C constant.

    In this case we have the equations: p’ = s’ (v/C); p’i = s’ (v/C) , in

both of which v/C is equal. Therefore: p’ : p’i = s’ : s’i

    The rates of profit of two capitals of the same composition are to

each other as the two corresponding rates of surplus value. Since in

the fraction v/C it is not a question of the absolute magnitudes of v and

C,  but  only  of  their  ratio,  this  applies  to  all  capitals  of  equal

composition whatever their absolute magnitude.

    80c + 20v + 20s; C = i00, s’ = i00%, p’ = 20% i60c + 40v + 20s; C

= 200, s’ = 50%, p’ = i0% i00% : 50% = 20% : i0%.

    If the absolute magnitudes of v and C are the same in both cases,

the rates of profit are moreover also related to one another as the

amounts of surplus value: p’ : p’i = s’v : s’iv = s : si.

    For instance:

    80c + 20v + 20s; s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%

    80c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 10%

    20%: 10% = 100 x 20: 50 x 20 = 20s: 10s.

    It is now clear that with capitals of equal absolute or percentage

composition  the  rate  of  surplus  value  can  differ  only  if  either  the

wages, or the length of the working day, or the intensity of labor, differ.

In the following three cases:

    I. 80c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 10%    II. 80c + 20v + 20s; s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%

    III. 80c + 20v + 40s; s’ = 200%, p’ = 40%

    the total value produced in I is 30 (20v + 10s); in II it is 40; in III it

is 60. This may come about in three different ways.

    First,  if  the  wages  are  different,  and  20v  stands  for  a  different

number  of  laborers  in  every  individual  case  [...]  Or  second,  if  the

intensity of labor varies [...] Or third, the working day differs in length

[...]

    2) s' and v variable, C constant.

    [...]

    3) s', v and C variable.

    This  case  offers  no  new  aspects  and  is  solved  by  the  general

formula given under II, in which s’ is variable.

    The effect of a change in the magnitude of the rate of surplus

value on the rate of profit hence yields the following [5] cases:

    1) p’ increases or decreases in the same proportion as s’ if v/C

remains constant.

    80c + 20v + 20s; s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%

    80c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 10%

    100% : 50% = 20% : 10%.

    2) p’ rises or falls at a faster rate than s’ if v/C moves in the same

direction as s’, that is, if it increases or decreases when s’ increases or

decreases.

    80c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 10%

    70c + 30v + 20s; s’ = 66%%, p’ = 10%

    50% : 66%% < 10% : 20%.

    3) p’ rises or falls at a slower rate than s’ if v/C changes inversely

to s’, but at a slower rate.

    262

    80c + 20v + 10s; s’ = 50%, p’ = 10%

    90c + 10v + 15s; s’ = 150%, p’ = 15%

    50% : 150% > 10% : 15%.

    4)  p’  rises  while  s’  falls,  or  falls  while  s’  rises  if  v/C  changes

inversely to, and at, a faster rate than, s’.

    80c + 20v + 20s; s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%

    90c + 10v + 15s; s’ = 150%, p’ = 15%.

    s’ has risen from 100% to 150%, p’ has fallen from 20% to 15%.    5) Finally, p’ remains constant whereas s’ rises or falls, while v/C

changes inversely to, but in exactly the same proportion as, s’.

    It is only this last case which still requires some explanation. We

have observed earlier in the variations of v/C that one and the same

rate of surplus value may be expressed in very much different rates of

profit. Now we see that one and the same rate of profit may be based

on very much different rates of surplus value. But while any change in

the proportion of v to C is sufficient to produce a difference in the rate

of profit so long as s is constant, a change in the magnitude of s must

lead to a corresponding inverse change of v/C in order that the rate of

profit remains the same. In the case of one and the same capital, or in

that of two capitals in one and the same country this is possible but in

exceptional cases. Assume, for example, that we have a capital of

    80c + 20v + 20s; C = 100, s’ = 100%, p’ = 20%;

    and let us suppose that wages fall to such an extent that the same

number of laborers is obtainable for 16v instead of 20v. Then, other

things being equal, and 4v being released, we shall have:

    80c + 16v + 24s; C = 96, s’ = 150%, p’ = 25%.

    In order that p’ may now = 20% as before, the total capital would

have to increase to 120, the constant capital therefore rising to 104:

    104c + 16v + 24s; C = 120, s’ = 150%, p’ = 20%.

    This  would  only  be  possible  if  the  fall  in  wages  were  attended

simultaneously by a change in the productivity of labor which required

such a change in the composition of capital. Or, if the value in money

of the constant capital increased from 80 to 104. In short, it would

require  an  accidental  coincidence  of  conditions  such  as  occurs  in

exceptional cases. In fact, a variation of s’ that does not call for the

simultaneous variation of v, and thus of v/C, is conceivable only under

very definite conditions, namely in such branches of industry in which

only fixed capital and labor are employed, while the materials of labor

are supplied by Nature [...]

    It follows from all of these five cases, therefore, that a rising rate

of profit may correspond to a falling or rising rate of surplus value, a

falling rate of profit to a rising or falling rate of surplus value, and a

constant rate of profit to a rising or falling rate of surplus value. And

we have seen in I that a rising, falling, or constant rate of profit may

also accord with a constant rate of surplus value.    The rate of profit, therefore, depends on two main factors — the

rate of surplus value and the day laborer of capital. The effects of

these two factors may be briefly summed up as follows, by giving the

composition in per cent, for it is immaterial which of the two portions of

the capital causes the variation:

    The rates of profit of two different capitals, or of one and the same

capital in two successive different conditions,

    are equal

    1) if the per cent composition of the capitals is the same and their

rates of surplus value are equal;

    2) if their per cent composition is not the same, and the rates of

surplus  value  are  unequal,  provided  the  products  of  the  rates  of

surplus value by the percentages of the variable portions of capitals (s’

by  v)  are  the  same,  i.e.,  if  the  masses  of  surplus  value  (s  =  s’v)

calculated in per cent of the total capital are equal; in other words, if

the factors s’ and v are inversely proportional to one another in both

cases.

    They are unequal

    1) if the per cent composition is equal and the rates of surplus

value  are  unequal,  in  which  case  they  are  related  as  the  rates  of

surplus value;

    2) if the rates of surplus value are the same and the per cent

composition is unequal, in which case they are related as the variable

portions of the capitals;

    3)  if  the  rates  of  surplus  value  are  unequal  and  the  per  cent

composition  not  the  same,  in  which  case  they  are  related  as  the

products s’v, i.e., as the quantities of surplus value calculated in per

cent of the total capital.      Chapter 4: The Effect of the Turnover On the Rate of Profit



    The effect of the turnover on the production of surplus value, and

consequently  of  profit,  has  been  discussed  in  Book  II.  Briefly

summarized  it  signifies  that  owing  to  the  time  span  required  for

turnover, not all the capital can be employed all at once in production;

some  of  the  capital  always  lies  idle,  either  in  the  form  of  money

capital, of raw material supplies, of finished but still unsold commodity

capital, or of outstanding claims; that the capital in active production,

i.e., in the production and appropriation of surplus value, is always

short by this amount, and that the produced and appropriated surplus

value is always curtailed to the same extent. The shorter the period of

turnover, the smaller this idle portion of capital as compared with the

whole,  and  the  larger,  therefore,  the  appropriated  surplus  value,

provided other conditions remain the same.

    It has already been shown in detail in Book II how the quantity of

produced surplus value is augmented by reductions in the period of

turnover, or of one of its two sections, in the time of production and the

time  of  circulation.  But  since  the  rate  of  profit  only  expresses  the

relation of the produced quantity of surplus value to the total capital

employed  in  its  production,  it  is  evident  that  any  such  reduction

increases the rate of profit. Whatever has been said earlier in Part II of

Book II in regard to surplus value, applies equally to profit [...]

    The chief means of reducing the time of production is higher labor

productivity, which is commonly called industrial progress. If this does

not involve a simultaneous considerable increase in the outlay of total

capital resulting from the installation of expensive machinery, etc., and

thus a reduction of the rate of profit, which is calculated on the total

capital, this rate must rise [...]

    The chief means of reducing the time of circulation is improved

communications [and transportation ...].

    [For] capitals with an equal per cent composition, with equal rates

of surplus value and equal working days, the rates of profit of the twocapitals are related inversely as their periods of turnover. If either the

composition, the rates of surplus value, the working day, or the wages,

are unequal in the two compared cases, this would naturally produce

further differences in the rates of profit; but these are independent of

the turnover and, for this reason, do not concern us at this point. They

have already been discussed in Chapter

    III.

    The direct effect of a reduced period of turnover on the production

of surplus value, and consequently of profit, consists of an increased

efficiency imparted thereby to the variable portion of capital, as shown

in  Book  II,  Chapter  XVI,  "The  Turnover  of  Variable  Capital".  This

Chapter demonstrated that a variable capital of 500 turned over ten

times a year produces as much surplus value in this time as a variable

capital of 5,000 with the same rate of surplus value and the same

wages, turned over just once a year [...]

    The quantity of surplus value appropriated in one year is [...] equal

to the quantity of surplus value appropriated in one turnover of the

variable capital multiplied by the number of such turnovers per year.

Suppose we call the surplus value, or profit, appropriated in one-year

S,  the  surplus  value  appropriated  in  one  period  of  turnover  s,  the

number of turnovers of the variable capital in one year n, then S = sn,

and the annual rate of surplus value S' = s'n, as already demonstrated

in Book II, Chapter XVI, I.

    It goes without saying that the formula p’ = s’ (v/C) = s’ v/(c + v) is

correct only so long as the v in the numerator is the same as that in

the denominator. In the denominator v stands for the entire portion of

the  total  capital  used  on  an  average  as  variable  capital  for  the

payment  of  wages.  The  v  of  the  numerator  is  primarily  only

determined by the fact that a certain quantity of surplus value = s is

produced and appropriated by it, whose relation to it s/v, is s’, the rate

of surplus value. It is only along these lines that the formula p’ = s/(c +

v)  is  transformed  into  the  other:  p’  =  s’  v/(c  +  v).  The  v  of  the

numerator will now be more accurately determined by the fact that it

must equal the v of the denominator, that is, the entire variable portion

of capital C. In other words, the equation p’ = (s/C) may be correctly

transformed  into  the  equation  p’  =  s’  v/(c  +  v)  only  if  s  stands  for

surplus value produced in one turnover of the variable capital. Shoulds be only a portion of this surplus value, then s = s’v is still correct, but

this v is then smaller than the v in C = c + v, because it is smaller than

the entire variable capital expended for wages. But should s stand for

more than the surplus value of one turnover of v, then a portion of this

v, or perhaps the whole of it, serves twice, namely in the first and in

the second turnover, and eventually in subsequent turnovers. The v

which produces the surplus value and represents the sum of all paid

wages, is therefore greater than the v in c + v and the calculation falls

into error.

    To make the formula precise for the annual rate of profit, we must

substitute  the  annual  rate  of  surplus  value  for  the  simple  rate  of

surplus value, that is, substitute S’ or s’n for s’. In other words, we

must multiply the rate of surplus value s’, or, what amounts to the

same thing, the variable capital v contained in C, by n, the number of

turnovers of this variable capital in one year. Thus we obtain p' = s'n

(v/C), which is the formula for the annual rate of profit [...]    Chapter 5: Economy in The Employment of Constant Capital



    I. In General


    The  increase  of  absolute  surplus  value,  or  the  prolongation  of

surplus labor, and thus of the working day, while the variable capital

remains the same and thus employs the same number of laborers at

the same nominal wages, regardless of whether overtime is paid or

not, reduces the relative value of the constant capital as compared to

the total and the variable capital, and thereby increases the rate of

profit, again irrespective of the growth of the quantity of surplus value

and a possibly rising rate of surplus value. The volume of the fixed

portion of constant capital, such as factory buildings, machinery, etc.,

remains the same, no matter whether these serve the labor process

16 or 12 hours. A prolongation of the working day does not entail any

fresh  expenditures  in  this,  the  most  expensive  portion  of  constant

capital.  Furthermore,  the  value  of  the  fixed  capital  is  thereby

reproduced in a smaller number of turnover periods, so that the time

for which it must be advanced to make a certain profit is abbreviated.

A prolongation of the working day therefore increases the profit, even

if overtime is paid, or even if, up to a certain point, it is better paid than

the normal hours of labor [...]

    The same conditions do not obtain if the working day is constant.

Then it is necessary either to increase the number of laborers, and

with them to a certain extent the amount of fixed capital, the buildings,

machinery, etc., in order to exploit a greater quantity of labor (for we

leave aside deductions from wages or the depression of wages below

their  normal  level),  or,  if  the  intensity  and,  consequently,  the

productivity  of  labor,  increase  and,  generally,  more  relative  surplus

value is produced, the magnitude of the circulating portion of constant

capital increases in such industrial branches which use raw materials,

since  more  raw  material,  etc.,  is  processed  in  a  given  time;  and,

secondly, the amount of machinery set in motion by the same numberof laborers, therefore also this part of constant capital, increases as

well.  Hence,  an  increase  in  surplus  value  is  accompanied  by  an

increase in constant capital, and the growing exploitation of labor by

greater  outlays  of  the  means  of  production  through  which  labor  is

exploited, i.e., by a greater investment of capital. Therefore, the rate of

profit is thereby reduced on the one hand while it increases on the

other.

    Quite a number of current expenses remain almost or entirely the

same whether the working day is longer or shorter. [For example, the]

cost  of  supervision  is  less  for  500  working-men  during  18  working

hours than for 750 working-men during 12 working hours [...] State

and  municipal  taxes,  fire  insurance,  wages  of  various  permanent

employees, depreciation of machinery, and various other expenses of

a factory, remain unchanged whether the working time is long or short

[...]

    Whatever reduces the wear of machinery, and of fixed capital in

general,  for  any  given  period  of  production,  cheapens  not  only  the

individual  commodity,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  in  its  price  every

individual commodity reproduces its aliquot share of this depreciation,

but  reduces  also  the  aliquot  portion  of  the  invested  capital  for  this

period. Repair work, etc., to the extent that it becomes necessary, is

added  to  the  original  cost  of  the  machinery.  A  reduction  in  repair

costs, due to greater durability of the machinery, lowers pro tanto the

price of this machinery [...]

    Another rise in the rate of profit is produced, not by savings in the

labor creating the constant capital, but by savings in the application of

this capital itself. On the one hand, the concentration of laborers, and

their  large-scale  co-operation,  saves  constant  capital.  The  same

buildings, and heating and lighting appliances, etc., cost relatively less

for the large-scale than for small-scale production. The same is true of

power  and  working  machinery.  Although  their  absolute  value

increases,  it  falls  in  comparison  to  the  increasing  extension  of

production and the magnitude of the variable capital, or the quantity of

labor power set in motion [...]

    We  must  make  a  distinction  in  economy  as  regards  use  of

constant capital. If the quantity, and consequently the sum of the value

of employed capital, increases, this is primarily only a concentration ofmore capital in a single hand. Yet it is precisely this greater quantity

applied by a single source — attended, as a rule, by an absolutely

greater  but  relatively  smaller  amount  of  employed  labor  —  which

permits economy of constant capital. To take an individual capitalist,

the volume of the necessary investment of capital, especially of its

fixed portion, increases. But its value decreases relative to the mass

of worked-up materials and exploited labor.

    This is now to be briefly illustrated by a few examples. We shall

begin at the end — the economy in the conditions of production, in so

far as these also constitute the living conditions of the laborer.

    [...]                  Chapter 6: The Effect of Price Fluctuations



    I. Fluctuations in The Price of Raw Materials, And Their Direct

Effects On the Rate of Profit


    The  assumption  in  this  case,  as  in  previous  ones,  is  that  no

change  takes  place  in  the  rate  of  surplus  value.  It  is  necessary  to

analyses the case in its pure form. However, it might be possible for a

specific capital, whose rate of surplus value remains unchanged, to

employ  an  increasing  or  decreasing  number  of  laborers,  in

consequence of contraction or expansion caused by such fluctuations

in the price of raw materials as we are to analyses here. In that case

the quantity of surplus value might vary, while the rate of surplus value

remains the same. Yet this should also be disregarded here as a side-

issue. If improvements of machinery and changes in the price of raw

materials  simultaneously  influence  either  the  number  of  laborers

employed by a definite capital, or the level of wages, one has but to

put together 1) the effect caused by the variations of constant capital

on the rate of profit, and 2) the effect caused by variations in wages on

the rate of profit. The result is then obtained of itself.

    But in general, it should be noted here, as in the previous case,

that if variations take place, either due to savings in constant capital,

or due to fluctuations in the price of raw materials, they always affect

the  rate  of  profit,  even  if  they  leave  the  wage,  hence  the  rate  and

amount of surplus value, untouched. They change the magnitude of C

in  s’  (v/C),  and  thus  the  value  of  the  whole  fraction.  It  is  therefore

immaterial, in this case as well — in contrast to what we found in our

analysis  of  surplus  value  —  in  which  sphere  of  production  these

variations occur; whether or not the production branches affected by

them  produce  necessities  for  laborers,  or  constant  capital  for  the

production of such necessities. The deductions made here are equally

valid for variations occurring in the production of luxury articles, and byluxury articles we here mean all production that does not serve the

reproduction of labor power.

    The raw materials here include auxiliary materials as well, such as

indigo, coal, gas, etc. Furthermore, so far as machinery is concerned

under this head, its own raw material consists of iron, wood, leather,

etc. Its own price is therefore affected by fluctuations in the price of

raw materials used in its construction. To the extent that its price is

raised through fluctuations, either in the price of the raw materials of

which  it  consists,  or  of  the  auxiliary  materials  consumed  in  its

operation, the rate of profit falls pro tanto. And vice versa.

    In the following analysis we shall confine ourselves to fluctuations

in the price of raw materials, not so far as they go to make up the raw

materials  of  machinery  serving  as  means  of  labor  or  as  auxiliary

materials  applied  in  its  operation,  but  in  so  far  as  they  enter  the

process in which commodities are produced. There is just one thing to

be noted here: the natural wealth in iron, coal, wood, etc., which are

the  principal  elements  used  in  the  construction  and  operation  of

machinery, presents itself here as a natural fertility of capital and is a

factor determining the rate of profit irrespective of the high or low level

of wages [...]

    Since  the  rate  of  profit  is  s/C,  or  s/(c  +  v),  it  is  evident  that

everything causing a variation in the magnitude of c, and thereby of C,

must also bring about a variation in the rate of profit, even if s and v,

and their mutual relation, remain unaltered. Now, raw materials are

one of the principal components of constant capital. Even in industries

which consume no actual raw materials, these enter the picture as

auxiliary materials or components of machinery, etc., and their price

fluctuations thus accordingly influence the rate of profit. Should the

price  of  raw  material  fall  by  an  amount  =  d,  then  s/C,  or  s/(c  +  v)

becomes s/(C - d), or s/((c - d) + v). Thus, the rate of profit rises.

Conversely, if the price of raw material rises, then s/C, or s/(c + v),

becomes s/(C + d), or s/((c + d) + v), and the rate of profit falls. Other

conditions  being  equal,  the  rate  of  profit,  therefore,  falls  and  rises

inversely to the price of raw material [...] It follows furthermore that

foreign trade influences the rate of profit, regardless of its influence on

wages through the cheapening of the necessities of life [...]    The value of raw and auxiliary materials passes entirely and all at

one time into the value of the product in the manufacture of which they

are consumed, while the elements of fixed capital transfer their value

to the product only gradually in proportion to their wear and tear. It

follows that the price of the product is influenced far more by the price

of raw materials than by that of fixed capital, although the rate of profit

is determined by the total value of the capital applied no matter how

much of it is consumed in the making of the product. But it is evident

—  although  we  merely  mention  it  in  passing,  since  we  here  still

assume  that  commodities  are  sold  at  their  values,  so  that  price

fluctuations caused by competition do not as yet concern us — that

the expansion or contraction of the market depends on the price of the

individual commodity and is inversely proportional to the rise or fall of

this price. It actually develops, therefore, that the price of the product

does not rise in proportion to that of the raw material, and that it does

not fall in proportion to that of raw material. Consequently, the rate of

profit falls lower in one instance, and rises higher in the other than

would have been the case if products were sold at their value.

    Further, the quantity and value of the employed machinery grows

with  the  development  of  labor  productivity  but  not  in  the  same

proportion as this productivity, i. e., not in the proportion in which this

machinery  increases  its  output.  In  those  branches  of  industry,

therefore, which do consume raw materials, i. e., in which the subject

of labor is itself a product of previous labor, the growing productivity of

labor is expressed precisely in the proportion in which a larger quantity

of  raw  material  absorbs  a  definite  quantity  of  labor,  hence  in  the

increasing amount of raw material converted in, say, one hour into

products, or processed into commodities. The value of raw material,

therefore,  forms  an  ever-growing  component  of  the  value  of  the

commodity product in proportion to the development of the productivity

of labor, not only because it passes wholly into this latter value, but

also because in every aliquot part of the aggregate product the portion

representing depreciation of machinery and the portion formed by the

newly added labor — both continually decrease. Owing to this falling

tendency,  the  other  portion  of  the  value  representing  raw  material

increases proportionally, unless this increase is counterbalanced by aproportionate decrease in the value of the raw material arising from

the growing productivity of the labor employed in its own production.

    Further, raw and auxiliary materials, just like wages, form parts of

the circulating capital and must, therefore, be continually replaced in

their  entirety  through  the  sale  of  the  product,  while  only  the

depreciation is to be renewed in the case of machinery, and first of all

in the form of a reserve fund. It is, moreover, in no way essential for

each individual sale to contribute its share to this reserve fund, so long

as the total annual sales contribute their annual share. This shows

again how a rise in the price of raw material can curtail or arrest the

entire process of reproduction if the price realized by the sale of the

commodities should not suffice to replace all the elements of these

commodities. Or, it may make it impossible to continue the process on

the scale required by its technical basis, so that only a part of the

machinery will remain in operation, or all the machinery will work for

only a fraction of the usual time [...]



    II. Appreciation, Depreciation, Release and Tie-Up of Capital


    The  phenomena  analyzed  in  this  Chapter  require  for  their  full

development the credit system and competition on the world market,

the latter being the basis and the vital element of capitalist production.

These  more  definite  forms  of  capitalist  production  can  only  be

comprehensively  presented,  however,  after  the  general  nature  of

capital is understood. Furthermore, they do not come within the scope

of this work and belong to its eventual continuation. Nevertheless, the

phenomena listed in the above title may be discussed in a general

way at this stage. They are interrelated, first with one another and,

secondly, also with the rate and amount of profit. They are to be briefly

discussed here if only because they create the impression that not

only the rate, but also the amount of profit — which is actually identical

with  the  amount  of  surplus  value  —  could  increase  or  decrease

independently  of  the  movements  of  the  quantity  or  rate  of  surplus

value.

    Are we to consider release and tie-up of capital, on the one hand,

and  its  appreciation  and  depreciation,  on  the  other,  as  differentphenomena?

    The question is what we mean by release and tie-up of capital?

Appreciation and depreciation are self-explanatory. All they mean is

that  a  given  capital  increases  or  decreases  in  value  as  a  result  of

certain  general  economic  conditions,  for  we  are  not  discussing  the

particular fate of an individual capital. All they mean, therefore, is that

the value of a capital invested in production rises or falls, irrespective

of its self-expansion by virtue of the surplus labor employed by it.

    By tie-up of capital we mean that certain portions of the total value

of  the  product  must  be  reconverted  into  elements  of  constant  and

variable  capital  if  production  is  to  proceed  on  the  same  scale.  By

release  of  capital  we  mean  that  a  portion  of  the  total  value  of  the

product which had to be reconverted into constant or variable capital

up  to  a  certain  time,  becomes  disposable  and  superfluous,  should

production continue on the previous scale. This release or tie-up of

capital is different from the release or tie-up of revenue. If the annual

surplus value of an individual capital C is, let us say, equal to x, then a

reduction  in  the  price  of  commodities  consumed  by  the  capitalists

would make x — a sufficient to procure the same enjoyments, etc., as

before. A portion of the revenue = a is released, therefore, and may

serve either to increase consumption or to be reconverted into capital

(for the purpose of accumulation). Conversely, if x + a is needed to

continue to live as before, then this standard of living must either be

reduced  or  a  portion  of  the  previously  accumulated  income  =  a,

expended as revenue.

      Appreciation  and  depreciation  may  affect  either  constant  or

variable capital, or both, and in the case of constant capital it may, in

turn, affect either the fixed, or the circulating portion, or both [...]

    Under  constant  capital  we  must  consider  the  raw  and  auxiliary

materials,  including  semi-finished  products,  all  of  which  we  here

include under the term of raw materials, machinery, and other fixed

capital.

    In the preceding analysis we referred especially to variations in

the price, or the value, of raw materials in respect to their influence on

the  rate  of  profit,  and  determined  the  general  law  that  with  other

conditions being equal, the rate of profit is inversely proportional to the

value of the raw materials. This is absolutely true for capital newlyinvested in a business enterprise, in which the investment, i. e., the

conversion of money into productive capital, is only just taking place.

    But aside from this capital, which is being newly invested, a large

portion of the already functioning capital is in the sphere of circulation,

while another portion is in the sphere of production. One portion is in

the market in the shape of commodities waiting to be converted into

money; another is on hand as money, in whatever form, waiting to be

reconverted into elements of production; finally, a third portion is in the

sphere of production, partly in its original form of means of production

such as raw and auxiliary materials, semi-finished products purchased

in the market, machinery and other fixed capital, and partly in the form

of products which are in the process of manufacture. The effect of

appreciation or depreciation depends here to a great extent on the

relative proportion of these component parts. Let us, for the sake of

simplicity, leave aside all fixed capital and consider only that portion of

constant  capital  which  consists  of  raw  and  auxiliary  materials,  and

semi-finished products, and both finished commodities in the market

and commodities still in the process of production.

    If the price of raw material, for instance of cotton, rises, then the

price  of  cotton  goods  —  both  semi-finished  goods  like  yarn  and

finished goods like cotton fabrics — manufactured while cotton was

cheaper, rises also. So does the value of the unprocessed cotton hold

in stock, and of the cotton in the process of manufacture. The latter

because it comes to represent more labor time in retrospect and thus

adds more than its original value to the product which it enters, and

more than the capitalist paid for it.

    Hence,  if  the  price  of  raw  materials  rises,  and  there  is  a

considerable quantity of available finished commodities in the market,

no  matter  what  the  stage  of  their  manufacture,  the  value  of  these

commodities rises, thereby enhancing the value of the existing capital.

The same is true for the supply of raw materials, etc., in the hands of

the producer. This appreciation of value may compensate, or more

than compensate, the individual capitalist, or even an entire separate

sphere  of  capitalist  production,  for  the  drop  in  the  rate  of  profit

attending a rise in the price of raw materials. Without entering into the

detailed  effects  of  competition,  we  might  state  for  the  sake  of

thoroughness  that  1)  if  available  supplies  of  raw  material  areconsiderable,  they  tend  to  counteract  the  price  increase  which

occurred at the place of their origin; 2) if the semi-finished and finished

goods  press  very  heavily  upon  the  market,  their  price  is  thereby

prevented  from  rising  proportionately  to  the  price  of  their  raw

materials.

    The  reverse  takes  place  when  the  price  of  raw  material  falls.

Other circumstances remaining the same, this increases the rate of

profit. The commodities in the market, the articles in the process of

production, and the available supplies of raw material, depreciate in

value and thereby counteract the attendant rise in the rate of profit [...]

    We proceed in this entire analysis from the assumption that the

rise or fall in prices expresses actual fluctuations in value. But since

we are here concerned with the effects such price variations have on

the rate of profit, it matters little what is at the bottom of them. The

present  statements  apply  equally  if  prices  rise  or  fall  under  the

influence of the credit system, competition, etc., and not on account of

fluctuations in value.

    Since the rate of profit equals the ratio of the excess over the

value of the product to the value of the total capital advanced, a rise

caused in the rate of profit by a depreciation of the advanced capital

would be associated with a loss in the value of capital. Similarly, a

drop caused in the rate of profit by an appreciation of the advanced

capital might possibly be associated with a gain.

    As for the other portion of constant capital, such as machinery

and fixed capital in general, the appreciation of value taking place in it

with respect mainly to buildings, real estate, etc., cannot be discussed

without the theory of ground rent, and does not therefore belong in this

Chapter [...]

    There is still variable capital to be considered.

    Inasmuch as the value of labor power rises because there is a

rise  in  the  value  of  the  means  of  subsistence  required  for  its

reproduction, or falls because there is a reduction in their value — and

the appreciation and depreciation of variable capital are really nothing

more than expressions of these two cases — a drop in surplus value

corresponds to such appreciation and an increase in surplus value to

such depreciation, provided the length of the working day remains the

same. But other circumstances — the release and tie-up of capital —may  also  be  associated  with  such  cases,  and  since  we  have  not

analyzed them so far, we shall briefly mention them now.

    If wages fall in consequence of a depreciation in the value of labor

power  (which  may  even  be  attended  by  a  rise  in  the  real  price  of

labor), a portion of the capital hitherto invested in wages is released.

Variable capital is set free. In the case of new investments of capital,

this has simply the effect of its operating with a higher rate of surplus

value.  It  takes  less  money  than  before  to  set  in  motion  the  same

amount of labor, and in this way the unpaid portion of labor increases

at the expense of the paid portion. But in the case of already invested

capital, not only does the rate of surplus value rise but a portion of the

capital previously invested in wages is also released. Until this time, it

was tied up and formed a regular portion which had to be deducted

from the proceeds for the product and advanced for wages, acting as

variable capital if the business were to continue on its former scale.

Now this portion is set free and may be used as a new investment, be

it to extend the same business or to operate in some other sphere of

production.

    Let us assume, for instance, that £500 per week were required at

first to employ 500 laborers, and that now only £400 are needed for

the same purpose. If the quantity of value produced in either case =

£1,000, the amount of weekly surplus value in the first case = £500

and the rate of surplus value 500/500 = 100%. But after the wage

reduction the quantity of surplus value £1,000 - £400 = £600, and its

rate 600/400 = 150%. And this increase in the rate of surplus value is

the only effect for one who starts a new enterprise in this sphere of

production  with  a  variable  capital  of  £400  and  a  corresponding

constant capital. But when this takes place in a business already in

operation,  the  depreciation  of  the  variable  capital  does  not  only

increase the quantity of surplus value from £500 to £600, and the rate

of surplus value from 100 to 150%, but releases £100 of the variable

capital for the further exploitation of labor. Hence, the same amount of

labor is exploited to greater advantage, and, what is more, the release

of £100 makes it possible to exploit more laborers than before at the

higher rate with the same variable capital of £500.

    Now the reverse situation. Suppose, with 500 employed laborers,

the original proportion in which the product is divided = 400v + 600s =1,000,  making  the  rate  of  surplus  value  =  150%.  In  that  case,  the

laborer receives £4/5 or 16 shillings per week. Should 500 laborers

cost £500 per week, due to an appreciation of variable capital, each

one of them will receive a weekly wage = £1, and £400 can employ

only 400 laborers. If the same number of laborers as before is put to

work, therefore, we have 500v + 500s = 1,000. The rate of surplus

value would fall from 150 to 100%, which is 1A. In the case of new

capital, the only effect would be this lower rate of surplus value. Other

conditions  being  equal,  the  rate  of  profit  would  also  have  fallen

accordingly, although not in the same proportion. For instance, if c =

2,000, we have in the one case 2,000c + 400v + 600s = 3,000. The

rate of surplus value = 150%, the rate of profit = 600/2,400 = 25%. In

the second case, 2,000c + 500v + 500s = 3,000. The rate of surplus

value = 100%, the rate of profit = 500/2,500 = 20%. In the case of

already invested capital, however, there would be a dual effect. Only

400 laborers could be employed with a £400 variable capital, and that

at a rate of surplus value of 100%. They would therefore produce an

aggregate surplus value of only £400. Furthermore, since a constant

capital of £2,000 requires 500 laborers for its operation, 400 laborers

can put into motion only a constant capital of £1,600. For production to

continue on the same scale, so that 1/5 of the machinery does not

stand  idle,  £100  must  be  added  to  the  variable  capital  in  order  to

employ 500 laborers as before. And this can be accomplished only by

tying up hitherto disposable capital, so that part of the accumulation

intended  to  extend  production  serves  merely  to  stop  a  gap,  or  a

portion  reserved  for  revenue  is  added  to  the  old  capital.  Then  a

variable capital increased by £100 produces £100 less surplus value.

More capital is required to employ the same number of laborers, and

at  the  same  time  the  surplus  value  produced  by  each  laborer  is

reduced.

    The advantages resulting from a release and the disadvantages

resulting from a tie-up of variable capital both exist only for capital

already engaged and reproducing itself under certain given conditions.

For newly invested capital the advantages on the one hand, and the

disadvantages on the other, are confined to an increase or drop in the

rate  of  surplus  value,  and  to  a  corresponding,  if  in  no  way

proportionate, change in the rate of profit.    The release and tie-up of variable capital, just analyzed, is the

result  of  a  depreciation  or  appreciation  of  the  elements  of  variable

capital, that is, of the cost of reproducing labor power.

    But variable capital could also be released if, with the wage rate

unchanged, fewer laborers were required due to the development of

labor  productivity  to  set  in  motion  the  same  amount  of  constant

capital. In like manner, there may reversely be a tie-up of additional

variable capital if more laborers are required for the same quantity of

constant capital due to a drop in productivity. If, on the other hand, a

portion of capital formerly employed as variable capital is employed in

the  form  of  constant  capital,  so  that  merely  a  different  distribution

exists  between  the  components  of  the  same  capital,  this  has  an

influence on both the rate of surplus value and the rate of profit, but

does not belong under the heading of tie-up and release of capital,

which is here being discussed.

    We have already seen that constant capital may also be tied up or

released  by  the  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  its  component

elements.  Aside  from  this,  it  can  be  tied  up  only  if  the  productive

power  of  labor  increases  (provided  a  portion  of  the  variable  is  not

converted  into  constant  capital),  so  that  the  same  amount  of  labor

creates  a  greater  product  and  therefore  sets  in  motion  a  larger

constant capital. The same may occur under certain circumstances if

productivity decreases, for instance in agriculture, so that the same

quantity of labor requires more means of production, such as seeds or

manure, drainage, etc., in order to produce the same output. Constant

capital  may  be  released  without  depreciation  if  improvements,

utilization of the forces of Nature, etc., enable a constant capital of

smaller  value  to  technically  perform  the  same  services  as  were

formerly performed by a constant capital of greater value [...]                        Chapter 7: Supplementary Remarks



    Suppose, as is assumed in this part, the amount of profit in any

particular sphere of production equals the sum of the surplus value

produced by the total capital invested in that sphere. Even then the

bourgeois will not consider his profit as identical with surplus value, i.

e.,  with  unpaid  surplus  labor,  and,  to  be  sure,  for  the  following

reasons:

    1)  In  the  process  of  circulation  he  forgets  the  process  of

production. He thinks that surplus value is made when he realizes the

value of commodities, which includes realization of their surplus value

[...]

    2) Assuming a uniform degree of exploitation, we have seen that

regardless  of  all  modifications  originating  in  the  credit  system,

regardless of the capitalists’ efforts to outwit and cheat one another,

and, lastly, regardless of any favorable choice of the market — the

rate of profit may differ considerably, depending on the low or high

prices of raw materials and the experience of the buyer, on the relative

productivity,  efficiency  and  cheapness  of  the  machinery,  on  the

greater  or  lesser  efficiency  of  the  aggregate  arrangement  in  the

various  stages  of  the  productive  process,  elimination  of  waste,  the

simplicity and efficiency of management and supervision, etc. In short,

given the surplus value for a certain variable capital, it still depends

very much on the individual business acumen of the capitalist, or of

his  managers  and  salesmen,  whether  this  same  surplus  value  is

expressed in a greater or smaller rate of profit, and accordingly yields

a greater or smaller amount of profit. Let the same surplus value of

£1,000, the product of £1,000 in wages, obtain in enterprise A for a

constant capital of £9,000, and in enterprise B for £11,000. In case A

we  have  p’  =  1,000/10,000  or  10%.  In  case  B  we  have  p’  =

1,000/12,000, or 8%. The total capital produces relatively more profit
                      1/3

in enterprise A than in B, because of a higher rate of profit, although

the variable capital advanced in both cases = £1,000 and the surplusvalue produced by each likewise = £1,000, so that in both cases there

exists  the  same  degree  of  exploitation  of  the  same  number  of

laborers.  This  difference  in  the  presentation  of  the  same  mass  of

surplus value, or the difference in the rates of profit, and therefore in

the profit itself, while the exploitation of labor is the same, may also be

due to other causes. Still, it may also be due wholly to a difference in

the business acumen with which both establishments are run. And this

circumstance misleads the capitalist, convinces him that his profits are

not due to exploiting labor, but, at least in part, to other independent

circumstances, and particularly his individual activity [...]

    A rise in the rate of profit is always due to a relative or absolute

increase of the surplus value in relation to its cost of production, i. e.,

to  the  advanced  total  capital,  or  to  a  decrease  in  the  difference

between the rate of profit and the rate of surplus value.

    Fluctuations in the rate of profit may occur irrespective of changes

in the organic components of the capital, or of the absolute magnitude

of  the  capital,  through  a  rise  or  fall  in  the  value  of  the  fixed  or

circulating advanced capital caused by an increase or a reduction of

the  working  time  required  for  its  reproduction,  this  increase  or

reduction taking place independently of the already existing capital.

The value of every commodity, thus also of the commodities making

up  the  capital,  is  determined  not  by  the  necessary  labor  time

contained  in  it,  but  by  the  social  labor  time  required  for  its

reproduction. This reproduction may take place under unfavorable or

under propitious circumstances, distinct from the conditions of original

production. If, under altered conditions, it takes double or, conversely,

half the time, to reproduce the same material capital, and if the value

of money remains unchanged, a capital formerly worth £100 would be

worth  £200,  or  £50  respectively.  Should  this  appreciation  or

depreciation affect all parts of capital uniformly, then the profit would

also  be  accordingly  expressed  in  double,  or  half,  the  amount  of

money. But if it involves a change in the organic composition of the

capital, if the ratio of the variable to the constant portion of capital

rises or falls, then, other circumstances remaining the same, the rate

of profit will rise with a relatively rising variable capital and fall with a

relatively falling one. If only the money value of the advanced capital

rises or falls (in consequence of a change in the value of money), thenthe money expression of the surplus value rises, or falls, in the same

proportion. The rate of profit remains unchanged.      PART 2: CONVERSION OF PROFIT INTO AVERAGE

                                      PROFIT        Chapter 8: Different Compositions of Capitals in Different

  Branches of Production and Resulting Differences in Rates of

                                        Profit



    In the preceding part we demonstrated, among other things, that

the rate of profit may vary — rise or fall — while the rate of surplus

value remains the same. In the present Chapter we assume that the

intensity of labor exploitation, and therefore the rate of surplus value

and the length of the working day, are the same in all the spheres of

production into which the social labor of a given country is divided.

Adam Smith has already comprehensively shown that the numerous

differences in the exploitation of labor in various spheres of production

balance one another by means of all kinds of existing compensations,

or compensations accepted as such on the basis of current prejudice,

so that they are merely evanescent distinctions and are of no moment

in  a  study  of  the  general  relations.  Other  differences,  for  instance

those in the wage scale, rest largely on the difference between simple

and complicated labor mentioned in the beginning of Book I [...], and

have  nothing  to  do  with  the  intensity  of  exploitation  in  the  different

spheres of production, although they render the lot of the laborer in

those spheres very unequal. For instance, if the labor of a goldsmith is

better  paid  than  that  of  a  day  laborer,  the  former’s  surplus  labor

produces  proportionately  more  surplus  value  than  the  latter’s.  And

although the equalizing of wages and working days, and thereby of

the rates of surplus value, among different spheres of production, and

even among different investments of capital in the same sphere of

production, is checked by all kinds of local obstacles, it is nevertheless

taking place more and more with the advance of capitalist production

and  the  subordination  of  all  economic  conditions  to  this  mode  of

production. The study of such frictions, while important to any special

work on wages, may be dispensed with as incidental and irrelevant in

a general analysis of capitalist production. In a general analysis of this

kind  it  is  usually  always  assumed  that  the  actual  conditions

correspond  to  their  conception,  or,  what  is  the  same,  that  actualconditions are represented only to the extent that they are typical of

their own general case.

    The difference in the rates of surplus value in different countries,

and consequently the national differences in the degree of exploitation

of  labor,  are  immaterial  for  our  present  analysis.  What  we  want  to

show in this part is precisely the way in which a general rate of profit

takes  shape  in  any  given  country.  It  is  evident,  however,  that  a

comparison  of  the  various  national  rates  of  profit  requires  only  a

collation of the previously studied with that which is here to be studied.

First  one  should  consider  the  differences  in  the  national  rates  of

surplus  value,  and  then,  on  the  basis  of  these  given  rates,  a

comparison should be made of the differences in the national rates of

profit. In so far as those differences are not due to differences in the

national rates of surplus value, they must be due to circumstances in

which  the  surplus  value  is  assumed,  just  as  in  the  analysis  of  this

Chapter, to be universally the same, i. e., constant.

    We  demonstrated  in  the  preceding  Chapter  that,  assuming  the

rate of surplus value to be constant, the rate of profit obtaining for a

given capital may rise or fall in consequence of circumstances which

raise or lower the value of one or the other portion of constant capital,

and  so  affect  the  proportion  between  the  variable  and  constant

components of capital. We further observed that circumstances which

prolong or reduce the time of turnover of an individual capital may

similarly influence the rate of profit. Since the mass of the profit is

identical with the mass of the surplus value, and with the surplus value

itself, it was also seen that the mass of the profit — as distinct from

the rate of profit — is not affected by the aforementioned fluctuations

of value. They only modify the rate in which a given surplus value, and

therefore a profit of a given magnitude, express themselves; in other

words,  they  modify  only  the  relative  magnitude  of  profit,  i.  e.,  its

magnitude  compared  with  the  magnitude  of  the  advanced  capital.

Inasmuch as capital was tied up or released by such fluctuations of

value, it was not only the rate of profit, but the profit itself, which was

likely to be affected in this indirect manner. However, this has then

always applied only to such capital as was already invested, and not

to new investments. Besides, the increase or reduction of profit always

depended  on  the  extent  to  which  the  same  capital  could,  inconsequence of such fluctuation of value, set in motion more or less

labor; in other words, it depended on the extent to which the same

capital could, with the rate of surplus value remaining the same, obtain

a larger or smaller amount of surplus value. Far from contradicting the

general rule, or from being an exception to it, this seeming exception

was really but a special case in the application of the general rule.

    It was seen in the preceding part that, the degree of exploitation

remaining constant, changes in the value of the component parts of

constant capital and in the time of turnover of capital are attended by

changes in the rate of profit. The obvious conclusion is that the rates

of profit in different spheres of production existing side by side have to

differ  when,  other  circumstances  remaining  unchanged,  the  time  of

turnover of capitals employed in the different spheres differs, or when

the value relation of the organic components of these capitals differs

in the various branches of production. What we previously regarded

as changes occurring successively with one and the same capital is

now  to  be  regarded  as  simultaneous  differences  among  capital

investments existing side by side in different spheres of production.

    In these circumstances we shall have to analyze: 1) the difference

in the organic composition of capitals, and 2) the difference in their

period of turnover.

    The premise in this entire analysis is naturally that by speaking of

the composition or turnover of a capital in a certain line of production

we always mean the average normal proportions of capital invested in

this sphere, and generally the average in the total capital employed in

that  particular  sphere,  and  not  the  accidental  differences  of  the

individual capitals.

    Since it is further assumed that the rate of surplus value and the

working  day  are  constant,  and  since  this  assumption  also  implies

constant  wages,  a  certain  quantity  of  variable  capital  represents  a

definite quantity of labor power set in motion, and therefore a definite

quantity of materialized labor. If, therefore, £100 represent the weekly

wage of 100 laborers, indicating 100 actual labor powers, then n times

£100 indicate the labor powers of n times 100 laborers, and £100/n

those of 100/n laborers. The variable capital thus serves here (as is

always the case when the wage is given) as an index of the amount of

labor  set  in  motion  by  a  definite  total  capital.  Differences  in  themagnitude  of  the  employed  variable  capitals  serve,  therefore,  as

indexes of the difference in the amount of employed labor power. If

£100  indicate  100  laborers  per  week,  and  represent  6,000  working

hours at 60 working hours per week, then £200 represent 12,000, and

£50 only 3,000 working hours.

    By  composition  of  capital  we  mean,  as  stated  in  Book  I,  the

proportion of its active and passive components, i. e., of variable and

constant capital. Two proportions enter into consideration under this

heading. They are not equally important, although they may produce

similar effects under certain circumstances.

    The  first  proportion  rests  on  a  technical  basis,  and  must  be

regarded as given at a certain stage of development of the productive

forces.  A  definite  quantity  of  labor  power  represented  by  a  definite

number  of  laborers  is  required  to  produce  a  definite  quantity  of

products in, say, one day, and — what is self-evident — thereby to

consume  productively,  i.  e.,  to  set  in  motion,  a  definite  quantity  of

means of production, machinery, raw materials, etc. A definite number

of laborers corresponds to a definite quantity of means of production,

and hence a definite quantity of living labor to a definite quantity of

labor  materialized  in  means  of  production.  This  proportion  differs

greatly  in  different  spheres  of  production,  and  frequently  even  in

different branches of one and the same industry, although it may by

coincidence be entirely or approximately the same in entirely separate

lines of industry.

    This proportion forms the technical composition of capital and is

the real basis of its organic composition.

    However, it is also possible that this first proportion may be the

same in different lines of industry, provided variable capital is merely

an index of labor power and constant capital merely an index of the

mass of means of production set in motion by this labor power. For

instance, certain work in copper and iron may require the same ratio

of labor power to mass of means of production. But since copper is

more  expensive  than  iron,  the  value  relation  between  variable  and

constant  capital  is  different  in  each  case,  and  hence  also  the  day

laborer of the two total capitals. The difference between the technical

composition and the value composition is manifested in each branch

of industry in that the value relation of the two portions of capital mayvary while the technical composition is constant, and the value relation

may  remain  the  same  while  the  technical  composition  varies.  The

latter case will, of course, be possible only if the change in the ratio of

the  employed  masses  of  means  of  production  and  labor  power  is

compensated by a reverse change in their values.

    The day laborer of capital, inasmuch as it is determined by, and

reflects, its technical composition, is called the organic composition of

capital.

    In the case of variable capital, therefore, we assume that it is the

index of a definite quantity of labor power, or of a definite number of

laborers, or a definite quantity of living labor set in motion. We have

seen in the preceding part that a change in the magnitude of the value

of variable capital might eventually indicate nothing but a higher or

lower price of the same mass of labor. But here, where the rate of

surplus value and the working day are taken to be constant, and the

wages  for  a  definite  working  period  are  given,  this  is  out  of  the

question.  On  the  other  hand,  a  difference  in  the  magnitude  of  the

constant capital may likewise be an index of a change in the mass of

means  of  production  set  in  motion  by  a  definite  quantity  of  labor

power. But it may also stem from a difference in value between the

means of production set in motion in one sphere and those of another.

Both points of view must therefore be examined here.

    Finally, we must take note of the following essential facts:

    Let  £100  be  the  weekly  wage  of  100  laborers.  Let  the  weekly

working hours = 60. Furthermore, let the rate of surplus value = 100%.

In this case, the laborers work 30 of the 60 hours for themselves and

30 hours gratis for the capitalist. In fact, the £100 of wages represent

just the 30 working hours of 100 laborers, or altogether 3,000 working

hours,  while  the  other  3,000  hours  worked  by  the  laborers  are

incorporated in the £100 of surplus value, or in the profit pocketed by

the capitalist. Although the wage of £100 does not, therefore, express

the value in which the weekly labor of the 100 laborers is materialized,

it indicates nevertheless (since the length of the working day and the

rate of surplus value are given) that this capital sets in motion 100

laborers for 6,000 working hours. The capital of £100 indicates this,

first, because it indicates the number of laborers set in motion, with £1

=  1  laborer  per  week,  hence  £100  =  100  laborers;  and,  secondly,because, since the rate of surplus value is given as 100%, each of

these laborers performs twice as much work as is contained in his

wages, so that £1, i. e., his wage, which is the expression of half a

week of labor, actuates a whole week’s labor, just as £100 sets in

motion  100  weeks  of  labor,  although  it  contains  only  50.  A  very

essential distinction is thus to be made in regard to variable capital

laid out in wages. Its value as the sum of wages, i. e., as a certain

amount of materialized labor, is to be distinguished from its value as a

mere index of the mass of living labor which it sets in motion. The

latter is always greater than the labor which it incorporates, and is,

therefore,  represented  by  a  greater  value  than  that  of  the  variable

capital.  This  greater  value  is  determined,  on  the  one  hand,  by  the

number of laborers set in motion by the variable capital and, on the

other, by the quantity of surplus labor performed by them.

    It follows from this manner of looking upon variable capital that:

    When a capital invested in production sphere A expends only 100

in variable capital for each 700 of total capital, leaving 600 for constant

capital, while a capital invested in production sphere B expends 600

for variable and only 100 for constant capital, then capital A of 700

sets in motion only 100 of labor power, or, in the terms of our previous

assumption, 100 weeks of labor, or 6,000 hours of living labor, while

the same amount of capital B will set in motion 600 weeks of labor, or

36,000 hours of living labor. The capital in A would then appropriate

only  50  weeks  of  labor,  or  3,000  hours  of  surplus  labor,  while  the

same amount of capital in B would appropriate 300 weeks of labor, or

18,000  hours.  Variable  capital  is  not  only  the  index  of  the  labor

embodied in it. When the rate of surplus value is known it is also an

index  of  the  amount  of  labor  set  in  motion  over  and  above  that

embodied in itself, i. e., of surplus labor. Assuming the same intensity

of exploitation, the profit in the first case would be 100/700 = 1/7 = 14

2/7%, and in the second case, 600/700 = 6/7 = 85 5/7%, or a six-fold

rate of profit. In this case, the profit itself would actually be six times as

great, 600 in B as against 100 in A, because the same capital set in

motion  six  times  as  much  living  labor,  which  at  the  same  level  of

exploitation  means  six  times  as  much  surplus  value,  and  thus  six

times as much profit.    But if the capital invested in A were not 700 but £7,000, while that

invested in B were only £700, and the organic composition of both

were to remain the same, then the capital in A would employ £1,000 of

the  £7,000  as  variable  capital,  that  is,  1,000  laborers  per  week  =

60,000 hours of living labor, of which 30,000 would be surplus labor.

Yet each £700 of the capital in A would continue to set in motion only

1/6 as much living labor, and hence only 1/6 as much surplus labor, as

the  capital  in  B,  and  would  produce  only  1/6  as  much  profit.  If  we

consider the rate of profit, then in A 1000/7000 = 100/700 = 14 2/7%,

as compared with 600/700, or 85 5/7%, in B. Taking equal amounts of

capital, the rates of profit differ because, owing to the different masses

of living labor set in motion, the masses of surplus value, and thus of

profit, differ, although the rates of surplus value are the same.

    We get practically the same result if the technical conditions are

the same in both spheres of production, but the value of the elements

of the employed constant capital is greater or smaller in the one than

in the other. Let us assume that both invest £100 as variable capital

and therefore employ 100 laborers per week to set in motion the same

quantity of machinery and raw materials. But let the latter be more

expensive in B than in A. For instance, let the £100 of variable capital

set in motion £200 of constant capital in A, and £400 in B. With the

same rate of surplus value, of 100%, the surplus value produced is in

either case equal to £100. Hence, the profit is also equal to £100 in

both. But the rate of profit in A is 100/(200c + 100v) = V = 33 V%,

while in B it is 100/(400c + 100v) = 1/5 = 20%. In fact, if we select a

certain aliquot part of the total capital in either case, we find that in

every £100 of B only £20, or 1/5, constitute variable capital, while in

every £100 of A £33V, or V, form variable capital. B produces less

profit for each £100, because it sets in motion less living labor than A.

The difference in the rates of profit thus resolves itself once more, in

this case, into a difference of the masses of profit, because of the

masses of surplus value, produced by each 100 of invested capital.

    The difference between this second example and the first is just

this:  The  equalization  between  A  and  B  in  the  second  case  would

require only a change in the value of the constant capital of either A or

B, provided the technical basis remained the same. But in the first

case the technical composition itself is different in the two spheres ofproduction and would have to be completely changed to achieve an

equalization.

    The  different  organic  composition  of  various  capitals  is  thus

independent of their absolute magnitude. It is always but a question of

how much of every 100 is variable and how much constant capital.

    Capitals  of  different  magnitude,  calculated  in  percentages,  or,

what  amounts  to  the  same  in  this  case,  capitals  of  the  same

magnitude operating for the same working time and with the same

degree of exploitation may produce very much different amounts of

profit, because of surplus value, for the reason that a difference in the

organic  composition  of  capital  in  different  spheres  of  production

implies  a  difference  in  their  variable  part,  thus  a  difference  in  the

quantities of living labor set in motion by them, and therefore also a

difference in the quantities of surplus labor appropriated by them. And

this surplus labor is the substance of surplus value, and thus of profit.

In different spheres of production equal portions of the total capital

comprise unequal sources of surplus value, and the sole source of

surplus  value  is  living  labor.  Assuming  the  same  degree  of  labor

exploitation, the mass of labor set in motion by a capital of 100, and

consequently the mass of surplus labor appropriated by it, depend on

the magnitude of its variable component. If a capital, consisting in per

cent of 90c + 10v, produced as much surplus value, or profit, at the

same degree of exploitation as a capital consisting of 10c + 90v, it

would be as plain as day that the surplus value, and thus value in

general, must have an entirely different source than labor, and that

political economy would then be deprived of every rational basis. If we

are to assume all the time that £1 stands for the weekly wage of a

laborer working 60 hours, and that the rate of surplus value is 100%,

then it is evident that the total value product of one laborer in a week,

is £2. Ten laborers would then produce no more than £20. And since

£10 of the £20 replace the wages, the ten laborers cannot produce

more surplus value than £10. On the other hand, 90 laborers, whose

total  product  is  £180,  and  whose  wages  amount  to  £90,  would

produce  a  surplus  value  of  £90.  The  rate  of  profit  in  the  first  case

would thus be 10%, and in the other 90%. If this were not so, then

value and surplus value would be something else than materialized

labor.  Since  capitals  in  different  spheres  of  production  viewed  inpercentages  —  or  as  capitals  of  equal  magnitude  —  are  divided

differently into variable and constant capital, setting in motion unequal

quantities of living labor and producing different surplus values, and

therefore  profits,  it  follows  that  the  rate  of  profit,  which  consists

precisely of the ratio of surplus value to total capital in per cent, must

also differ.

    Now, if capitals in different spheres of production, calculated in

per cent, i. e., capitals of equal magnitude, produce unequal profits in

consequence of their different organic composition, then it follows that

the profits of unequal capitals in different spheres of production cannot

be  proportional  to  their  respective  magnitudes,  or  that  profits  in

different spheres of production are not proportional to the magnitude

of the respective capitals invested in them. For if profits were to grow

pro rata to the magnitude of invested capital, it would mean that in per

cent  the  profits  would  be  the  same,  so  that  in  different  spheres  of

production  capitals  of  equal  magnitude  would  have  equal  rates  of

profit, in spite of their different organic composition. It is only in the

same  sphere  of  production,  where  we  have  a  given  organic

composition of capital, or in different spheres with the same organic

composition  of  capital,  that  the  amounts  of  profits  are  directly

proportional to the amounts of invested capitals. To say that the profits

of unequal capitals are proportional to their magnitudes would only

mean that capitals of equal magnitude yield equal profits, or that the

rate of profit is the same for all capitals, whatever their magnitude and

organic composition.

    These  statements  hold  good  on  the  assumption  that  the

commodities  are  sold  at  their  values.  The  value  of  a  commodity  is

equal to the value of the constant capital contained in it, plus the value

of  the  variable  capital  reproduced  in  it,  plus  the  increment  —  the

surplus value produced — of this variable capital. At the same rate of

surplus value, its quantity evidently depends on the quantity of the

variable capital. The value of the product of an individual capital of 100

is, in one case, 90c + 10v + 10s = 110; and in the other, 10c + 90v +

90s = l90. If the commodities go at their values, the first product is sold

at 110, of which 10 represent surplus value, or unpaid labor, and the

second at 190, of which 90 represent surplus value, or unpaid labor.    This  is  particularly  important  in  comparing  rates  of  profit  in

different countries. Let us assume that the rate of surplus value in one

European  country  is  100%,  so  that  the  laborer  works  half  of  the

working day for himself and the other half for his employer. Let us

further assume that the rate of surplus value in an Asian country is

25%, so that the laborer works 4/5 of the working day for himself, and

1/5 for his employer. Let 84c + l6v be the composition of the national

capital in the European country, and 16c + 84v in the Asian country,

where little machinery, etc., is used, and where a given quantity of

labor power consumes relatively little raw material productively in a

given time. Then we have the following calculation:

    In the European country the value of the product = 84c + 16v +

16s = 116; rate of profit = 16/100 = 16%.

    In the Asian country the value of the product = 16c + 84v + 21s =

121; rate of profit = 21/100 = 21%.

    The  rate  of  profit  in  the  Asian  country  is  thus  more  than  25%

higher  than  in  the  European  country,  although  the  rate  of  surplus

value in the former is one-fourth that of the latter. Men like Carey,

Bastiat, and tutti quanti, would arrive at the very opposite conclusion.

    By the way, different national rates of profit are mostly based on

different  national  rates  of  surplus  value.  But  in  this  Chapter  we

compare unequal rates of profit derived from the same rate of surplus

value.

    Aside from differences in the organic composition of capitals, and

therefore  aside  from  the  different  masses  of  labor  —  and

consequently, other circumstances remaining the same, from different

masses  of  surplus  labor  set  in  motion  by  capitals  of  the  same

magnitude  in  different  spheres  of  production,  there  is  yet  another

source of inequality in rates of profit. This is the different period of

turnover of capital in different spheres of production. We have seen in

Chapter  IV  that,  other  conditions  being  equal,  the  rates  of  profit  of

capitals of the same organic composition are inversely proportional to

their periods of turnover. We have also seen that the same variable

capital  turned  over  in  different  periods  of  time  produces  different

quantities of annual surplus value. The difference in the periods of

turnover is therefore another reason why capitals of equal magnitude

in different spheres of production do not produce equal profits in equalperiods, and why, consequently, the rates of profit in these different

spheres differ.

    As  far  as  the  ratio  of  the  fixed  and  circulating  capital  in  the

composition  of  capitals  is  concerned,  however,  it  does  not  in  itself

affect the rate of profit in the least. It can affect the rate of profit only if

in one case, this difference in composition coincides with a different

ratio of the variable and constant parts, so that the difference in the

rate of profit is due to this latter difference, and not to the different ratio

of fixed and circulating capital; and, in the other case, if the difference

in the ratio of the fixed and circulating parts of capital is responsible for

a  difference  in  the  period  of  turnover  in  which  a  certain  profit  is

realized.  If  capitals  are  divided  into  fixed  and  circulating  capital  in

different proportions, this will naturally always influence the period of

turnover and cause differences in it. But this does not imply that the

period of turnover, in which the same capitals realize certain profits, is

different. For instance, A may continually have to convert the greater

part of its product into raw materials, etc., while B may use the same

machinery, etc., for a longer time, and may need less raw material, but

both A and B, being occupied in production, always have a part of

their  capital  engaged,  the  one  in  raw  materials,  i.  e.,  in  circulating

capital,  and  the  other  in  machinery,  etc.,  or  in  fixed  capital.  A

continually  converts  a  portion  of  its  capital  from  the  form  of

commodities into that of money, and the latter again into the form of

raw material, while B employs a portion of its capital for a longer time

as  an  instrument  of  labor  without  any  such  conversions.  If  both  of

them employ the same amount of labor, they will indeed sell quantities

of  products  of  unequal  value  in  the  course  of  the  year,  but  both

quantities of products will contain equal amounts of surplus value, and

their rates of profit, calculated on the entire capital invested, will be the

same, although their composition of fixed and circulating capital, and

their  periods  of  turnover,  are  different.  Both  capitals  realize  equal

profits in equal periods, although their periods of turnover are different.

The difference in the period of turnover is in itself of no importance,

except so far as it affects the mass of surplus labor appropriated and

realized by the same capital in a given time. If, therefore, a different

division into fixed and circulating capital does not necessarily imply a

different period of turnover, which would in its turn imply a differentrate of profit, it is evident that if there is any such difference in the

rates of profit, it is not due to a different ratio of fixed to circulating

capital as such, but rather to the fact that this different ratio indicates

an inequality in the periods of turnover affecting the rate of profit.

    It  follows,  therefore,  that  the  different  composition  of  constant

capital  in  respect  to  its  fixed  and  circulating  portions  in  various

branches of production has in itself no bearing on the rate of profit,

since it is the ratio of variable to constant capital which decides this

question, while the value of the constant capital, and therefore also its

magnitude in relation to the variable is entirely unrelated to the fixed or

circulating nature of its components. Yet it may be found — and this

often leads to incorrect conclusions — that wherever fixed capital is

considerably advanced this but expresses the fact that production is

on  a  large  scale,  so  that  constant  capital  greatly  outweighs  the

variable, or that the living labor power it employs is small compared to

the mass of the means of production which it operates.

    We have thus demonstrated that different lines of industry have

different rates of profit, which correspond to differences in the organic

composition of their capitals and, within indicated limits, also to their

different periods of turnover; given the same time of turnover, the law

(as a general tendency) that profits are related to one another as the

magnitudes of the capitals, and that, consequently, capitals of equal

magnitude yield equal profits in equal periods, applies only to capitals

of the same organic composition, even with the same rate of surplus

value.  These  statements  hold  good  on  the  assumption  which  has

been the basis of all our analyses so far, namely that the commodities

are sold at their values. There is no doubt, on the other hand, that

aside  from  unessential,  incidental  and  mutually  compensating

distinctions,  differences  in  the  average  rate  of  profit  in  the  various

branches of industry do not exist in reality, and could not exist without

abolishing the entire system of capitalist production. It would seem,

therefore, that here the theory of value is incompatible with the actual

process, incompatible with the real phenomena of production, and that

for this reason any attempt to understand these phenomena should be

given up.

    It follows from the first part of this volume that the cost prices of

products in different spheres of production are equal if equal portionsof capital have been advanced for their production, however different

the  organic  composition  of  such  capitals.  The  distinction  between

variable and constant capital escapes the capitalist in the cost price. A

commodity for whose production he must advance £100 costs him just

as much, whether he invests 90c + 10v, or 10c + 90v. It costs him

£100 in either case — no more and no less. The cost prices are the

same for equal capitals in different spheres, no matter how much the

produced values and surplus values may differ. The equality of cost

prices is the basis for competition among invested capitals, whereby

an average profit is brought about.        Chapter 9: Formation of A General Rate of Profit (Average

Rate of Profit) And Transformation of the Values of Commodities

                          into Prices of Production



    The organic composition of capital depends at any given time on

two  circumstances:  first,  on  the  technical  relation  of  labor  power

employed  to  the  mass  of  the  means  of  production  employed;

secondly,  on  the  price  of  these  means  of  production.  This

composition,  as  we  have  seen,  must  be  examined  on  the  basis  of

percentage ratios. We express the organic composition of a certain

capital consisting 4/5 of constant and 1/5 of variable capital, by the

formula 80c + 20v. It is furthermore assumed in this comparison that

the rate of surplus value is unchangeable. Let it be any rate picked at

random; say, 100%. The capital of 80c + 20v then produces a surplus

value of 20s, and this yields a rate of profit of 20% on the total capital.

The  magnitude  of  the  actual  value  of  its  product  depends  on  the

magnitude of the fixed part of the constant capital, and on the portion

which passes from it through wear and tear into the product. But since

this circumstance has absolutely no bearing on the rate of profit, and

hence,  in  the  present  analysis,  we  shall  assume,  for  the  sake  of

simplicity,  that  the  constant  capital  is  everywhere  uniformly  and

entirely transferred to the annual product of the capitals. It is further

assumed  that  the  capitals  in  the  different  spheres  of  production

annually realize the same quantities of surplus value proportionate to

the magnitude of their variable parts. For the present, therefore, we

disregard  the  difference  which  may  be  produced  in  this  respect  by

variations  in  the  duration  of  turnovers.  This  point  will  be  discussed

later.

    Let us take five different spheres of production, and let the capital

in each have a different organic composition as follows:

    Capitals Rate of Surplus Value Surplus Value Value of Product

Rate of Profit

  

    Here, in different spheres of production with the same degree of

exploitation,  we  find  considerably  different  rates  of  profit

corresponding to the different organic composition of these capitals.

    The  sum  total  of  the  capitals  invested  in  these  five  spheres  of

production = 500; the sum total of the surplus value produced by them

= 110; the aggregate value of the commodities produced by them =

610. If we consider the 500 as a single capital, and capitals I to V

merely  as  its  component  parts  (as,  say,  different  departments  of  a

cotton mill, which has different ratios of constant to variable capital in

its carding, preparatory spinning, spinning, and weaving shops, and in

which  the  average  ratio  for  the  factory  as  a  whole  has  still  to  be

calculated), the mean composition of this capital of 500 would = 390c

+ 110v, or, in per cent, = 78c + 22v. Should each of the capitals of 100

be regarded as 1/5 of the total capital, its composition would equal this

average  of  78c  +  22v;  for  every  100  there  would  be  an  average

surplus value of 22; thus, the average rate of profit would = 22%, and,

finally, the price of every fifth of the total product produced by the 500

would = 122. The product of each fifth of the advanced total capital

would then have to be sold at 122.

    But  to  avoid  entirely  erroneous  conclusions  it  must  not  be

assumed that all cost prices = 100.

    With 80c + 20v and a rate of surplus value = 100%, the total value

of commodities produced by capital I = 100 would be 80c + 20v + 20s

=  120,  provided  the  entire  constant  capital  went  into  the  annual

product. Now, this may under certain circumstances be the case in

some spheres of production. But hardly in cases where the proportion

of c : v = 4 : 1. We must, therefore, remember in comparing the values

produced by each 100 of the different capitals, that they will differ in

accordance  with  the  different  composition  of  c  as  to  its  fixed  and

circulating parts, and that, in turn, the fixed portions of each of thedifferent capitals depreciate slowly or rapidly as the case may be, thus

transferring unequal quantities of their value to the product in equal

periods of time. But this is immaterial to the rate of profit. No matter

whether  the  80c  give  up  a  value  of  80,  or  50,  or  5,  to  the  annual

product, and the annual product consequently = 80c + 20v + 20s =

120, or 50c + 20v + 20s = 90, or 5c + 20v + 20s = 45; in all these

cases the redundancy of the product’s value over its cost price = 20,

and in calculating the rate of profit these 20 are related to the capital

of 100 in all of them. The rate of profit of capital I, therefore, is 20% in

every  case.  To  make  this  still  plainer,  we  let  different  portions  of

constant  capital  go  into  the  value  of  the  product  of  the  same  five

capitals in the following table:

 










 

    If we now again consider capitals I to V as a single total capital,

we shall see that, in this case as well, the composition of the sums of

these five capitals = 500 = 390c + 110v, so that we get the same

average composition = 78c + 22v, and, similarly, the average surplus

value  remains  22.  If  we  divide  this  surplus  value  uniformly  among

capitals I to V, we get the following commodity prices:

 










     Taken  together,  the  commodities  are  sold  at  2  +  7  +  17  =  26

above, and 8 + 18 = 26 below their value, so that the deviations of

price  from  value  balance  out  one  another  through  the  uniform

distribution of surplus value, or through addition of the average profit

of 22 per 100 units of advanced capital to the respective cost prices of

the commodities I to V. One portion of the commodities is sold above

its value in the same proportion in which the other is sold below it. And

it is only the sale of the commodities at such prices that enables the

rate of profit for capitals I to V to be uniformly 22%, regardless of their

different organic composition. The prices which obtain as the average

of  the  various  rates  of  profit  in  the  different  spheres  of  production

added  to  the  cost  prices  of  the  different  spheres  of  production,

constitute the prices of production. They have as their prerequisite the

existence of a general rate of profit, and this, again, presupposes that

the rates of profit in every individual sphere of production taken by

itself have previously been reduced to just as many average rates.

These particular rates of profit = s/c in every sphere of production, and

must, as occurs in Part I of this book, be deduced out of the values of

the  commodities.  Without  such  deduction  the  general  rate  of  profit

(and consequently the price of production of commodities) remains a

vague and senseless conception. Hence, the price of production of a

commodity is equal to its cost price plus the profit, allotted to it in per

cent, in accordance with the general rate of profit, or, in other words,

to its cost price plus the average profit.

    Owing to the different organic compositions of capitals invested in

different lines of production, and, hence, owing to the circumstance

that — depending on the different percentage which the variable part

makes up in a total capital of a given magnitude — capitals of equal

magnitude put into motion very different quantities of labor, they also

appropriate very different quantities of surplus labor or produce very

different  quantities  of  surplus  value.  Accordingly,  the  rates  of  profit

prevailing  in  the  various  branches  of  production  are  originally  very

different. These different rates of profit are equalized by competition to

a  single  general  rate  of  profit,  which  is  the  average  of  all  these

different  rates  of  profit.  The  profit  accruing  in  accordance  with  this

general rate of profit to any capital of a given magnitude, whatever its

organic  composition,  is  called  the  average  profit.  The  price  of  acommodity,  which  is  equal  to  its  cost  price  plus  the  share  of  the

annual  average  profit  on  the  total  capital  invested  (not  merely

consumed)  in  its  production  that  falls  to  it  in  accordance  with  the

conditions  of  turnover,  is  called  its  price  of  production.  Take,  for

example, a capital of 500, of which 100 is fixed capital, and let 10% of

this wear out during one turnover of the circulating capital of 400. Let

the average profit for the period of turnover be 10%. In that case the

cost price of the product created during this turnover will be 10c for

wear  plus  400  (c  +  v)  circulating  capital  =  410,  and  its  price  of

production will be 410 cost price plus (10% profit on 500) 50 = 460.

    Thus, although in selling their commodities the capitalists of the

various  spheres  of  production  recover  the  value  of  the  capital

consumed in their production, they do not secure the surplus value,

and  consequently  the  profit,  created  in  their  own  sphere  by  the

production of these commodities. What they secure is only as much

surplus value, and hence profit, as falls, when uniformly distributed, to

the share of every aliquot part of the total social capital from the total

social surplus value, or profit, produced in a given time by the social

capital in all spheres of production. Every 100 of an invested capital,

whatever its composition, draws as much profit in a year, or any other

period of time, as falls to the share of every 100, the Nth part of the

total capital, during the same period. So far as profits are concerned,

the  various  capitalists  are  just  so  many  stockholders  in  a  stock

company in which the shares of profit are uniformly divided per 100,

so  that  profits  differ  in  the  case  of  the  individual  capitalists  only  in

accordance  with  the  amount  of  capital  invested  by  each  in  the

aggregate  enterprise,  i.  e.,  according  to  his  investment  in  social

production  as  a  whole,  according  to  the  number  of  his  shares.

Therefore, the portion of the price of commodities which replaces the

elements of capital consumed in the production of these commodities,

the portion, therefore, which will have to be used to buy back these

consumed capital values, i. e., their cost price, depends entirely on the

outlay of capital within the respective spheres of production. But the

other element of the price of commodities, the profit added to this cost

price, does not depend on the amount of profit produced in a given

sphere of production by a given capital in a given period of time. It

depends on the mass of profit which falls as an average for any givenperiod to each individual capital as an aliquot part of the total social

capital invested in social production.

    When  a  capitalist  sells  his  commodities  at  their  price  of

production, therefore, he recovers money in proportion to the value of

the  capital  consumed  in  their  production  and  secures  profit  in

proportion to this advanced capital as the aliquot part in the total social

capital. His cost prices are specific. But the profit added to them is

independent  of  his  particular  sphere  of  production,  being  a  simple

average per 100 units of invested capital.

    Let  us  assume  that  the  five  different  investments  I  to  V  of  the

foregoing illustration belong to one man. The quantity of variable and

constant capital consumed per 100 of the invested capital in each of

the departments I to V in the production of commodities I to V would,

needless to say, make up a part of their price, since at least this price

is  required  to  recover  the  advanced  and  consumed  portions  of  the

capital. These cost prices would therefore be different for each class

of the commodities I to V, and would as such be set differently by the

owner.  But  as  regards  the  different  quantities  of  surplus  value,  or

profit,  produced  by  I  to  V,  they  might  easily  be  regarded  by  the

capitalist as profit on his advanced aggregate capital, so that each 100

units would get their definite aliquot part. Hence, the cost prices of the

commodities  produced  in  the  various  departments  I  to  V  would  be

different; but that portion of their selling price derived from the profit

added per 100 capital would be the same for all these commodities.

The aggregate price of the commodities I to V would therefore equal

their aggregate value, i. e., the sum of the cost prices I to V plus the

sum of the surplus values, or profits, produced in I to V. It would hence

actually  be  the  money  expression  of  the  total  quantity  of  past  and

newly applied labor incorporated in commodities I to V. And in the

same  way  the  sum  of  the  prices  of  production  of  all  commodities

produced in society — the totality of all branches of production — is

equal to the sum of their values.

    This statement seems to conflict with the fact that under capitalist

production the elements of productive capital are, as a rule, bought on

the market, and that for this reason their prices include profit which

has already been realized, hence, include the price of production of

the respective branch of industry together with the profit contained init, so that the profit of one branch of industry goes into the cost price of

another. But if we place the sum of the cost prices of the commodities

of an entire country on one side, and the sum of its surplus values, or

profits,  on  the  other,  the  calculation  must  evidently  be  right.  For

instance, take a certain commodity A. Its cost price may contain the

profits of B, C, D, etc., just as the cost prices of B, C, D, etc., may

contain the profits of A. Now, as we make our calculation the profit of

A will not be included in its cost price, nor will the profits of B, C, D,

etc., be included in theirs. Nobody ever includes his own profit in his

cost price. If there are, therefore, n spheres of production, and if each

makes a profit amounting to p, then their aggregate cost price = k - np.

Considering the calculation as a whole we see that since the profits of

one sphere of production pass into the cost price of another, they are

therefore included in the calculation as constituents of the total price of

the end-product, and so cannot appear a second time on the profit

side. If any do appear on this side, however, then only because the

commodity  in  question  is  itself  an  ultimate  product,  whose  price  of

production does not pass into the cost price of some other commodity.

    If the cost price of a commodity includes a sum = p, which stands

for the profits of the producers of the means of production, and if a

profit = p1 is added to this cost price, the aggregate profit P = p + p1.

The aggregate cost price of the commodity, considered without the

profit portions, is then its own cost price minus P. Let this cost price be

k. Then, obviously, k + p = k + p + p1. In dealing with surplus values,

we have seen in Book I that the product of every capital may be so

treated, as though a part of it replaces only capital, while the other part

represents  only  surplus  value.  In  applying  this  approach  to  the

aggregate  product  of  society,  we  must  make  some  rectifications.

Looking upon society as a whole, the profit contained in, say, the price

of flax cannot appear twice — not both as a portion of the linen price

and as the profit of the flax.

    There is no difference between surplus value and profit, as long

as, e.g., A’s surplus value passes into B’s constant capital. It is, after

all, quite immaterial to the value of the commodities, whether the labor

contained in them is paid or unpaid. This merely shows that B pays for

A’s surplus value. A’s surplus value cannot be entered twice in the

total calculation.    But the difference is this: Aside from the fact that the price of a

particular product, let us say that of capital B, differs from its value

because the surplus value realized in B may be greater or smaller

than  the  profit  added  to  the  price  of  the  products  of  B,  the  same

circumstance  applies  also  to  those  commodities  which  form  the

constant part of capital B, and indirectly also its variable part, as the

laborers’  necessities  of  life.  So  far  as  the  constant  portion  is

concerned, it is itself equal to the cost price plus the surplus value,

here therefore equal to cost price plus profit, and this profit may again

be greater or smaller than the surplus value for which it stands. As for

the variable capital, the average daily wage is indeed always equal to

the value produced in the number of hours the laborer must work to

produce the necessities of life. But this number of hours is in its turn

obscured by the deviation of the prices of production of the necessities

of life from their values. However, this always resolves itself to one

commodity  receiving  too  little  of  the  surplus  value  while  another

receives too much, so that the deviations from the value which are

embodied in the prices of production compensate one another. Under

capitalist production, the general law acts as the prevailing tendency

only  in  a  very  complicated  and  approximate  manner,  as  a  never

ascertainable average of ceaseless fluctuations.

    Since the general rate of profit is formed by taking the average of

the various rates of profit for each 100 of capital invested in a definite

period, e.g., a year, it follows that in it the difference brought about by

different periods of turnover of different capitals is also effaced. But

these  differences  have  a  decisive  bearing  on  the  different  rates  of

profit in the various spheres of production whose average forms the

general rate of profit.

    In  the  preceding  illustration  concerning  the  formation  of  the

average  rate  of  profit  we  assumed  each  capital  in  each  sphere  of

production = 100, and we did so to show the difference in the rates of

profit  in  per  cent,  and  thus  also  the  difference  in  the  values  of

commodities  produced  by  equal  amounts  of  capital.  But  it  goes

without saying that the actual amounts of surplus value produced in

each sphere of production depend on the magnitude of the invested

capitals, since the composition of capital is given in each sphere of

production.  Yet  the  actual  rate  of  profit  in  any  particular  sphere  ofproduction is not affected by the fact that the capital invested is 100,

or  m  times  100,  or  xm  times  100.  The  rate  of  profit  remains  10%,

whether the total profit is 10:100, or 1,000:10,000.

    However, since the rates of profit differ in the various spheres of

production,  with  very  much  different  quantities  of  surplus  value,  or

profit,  being  produced  in  them,  depending  on  the  proportion  of  the

variable to the total capital, it is evident that the average profit per 100

of the social capital, and hence the average, or general, rate of profit,

will differ considerably in accordance with the respective magnitudes

of  the  capitals  invested  in  the  various  spheres.  Let  us  take  four

capitals A, B, C, D. Let the rate of surplus value for all = 100%. Let the

variable capital for each 100 of the total be 25 in A, 40 in B, 15 in C,

and 10 in D. Then each 100 of the total capital would yield a surplus

value, or profit, of 25 in A, 40 in B, 15 in C, and 10 in D. This would

total 90, and if these four capitals are of the same magnitude, the

average rate of profit would then be 90/4 or 22%.
                                                            1/2

    Suppose, however, the total capitals are as follows: A = 200, B =

300,  C  =  1,000,  D  =  4,000.  The  profits  produced  would  then

respectively = 50, 120, 150, and 400. This makes a profit of 720, and

an average rate of profit of 13 1/11% for 5,500, the sum of the four

capitals.

    The masses of the total value produced differ in accordance with

the  magnitudes  of  the  total  capitals  invested  in  A,  B,  C,  D,

respectively. The formation of the average rate of profit is, therefore,

not merely a matter of obtaining the simple average of the different

rates of profit in the various spheres of production, but rather one of

the relative weight which these different rates of profit have in forming

this average. This, however, depends on the relative magnitude of the

capital invested in each particular sphere, or on the aliquot part which

the capital invested in each particular sphere forms in the aggregate

social  capital.  There  will  naturally  be  a  very  great  difference,

depending  on  whether  a  greater  or  smaller  part  of  the  total  capital

produces a higher or lower rate of profit. And this, again, depends on

how much capital is invested in spheres, in which the variable capital

is relatively small or large compared to the total capital. It is just like

the average interest obtained by a usurer who lends various quantities

of capital at different interest rates; for instance, at 4, 5, 6, 7%, etc.The average rate will depend entirely on how much of his capital he

has loaned out at each of the different rates of interest.

    The general rate of profit is, therefore, determined by two factors:

    1) The organic composition of the capitals in the different spheres

of production, and thus, the different rates of profit in the individual

spheres.

    2)  The  distribution  of  the  total  social  capital  in  these  different

spheres, and thus, the relative magnitude of the capital invested in

each particular sphere at the specific rate of profit prevailing in it; i. e.,

the  relative  share  of  the  total  social  capital  absorbed  by  each

individual sphere of production.

    In Books I and II we dealt only with the value of commodities. On

the one hand, the cost price has now been singled out as a part of this

value, and, on the other, the price of production of commodities has

been developed as its converted form.

    Suppose the composition of the average social capital is 80c +

20v and the annual rate of surplus value, s’, is 100%. In that case the

average annual profit for a capital of 100 = 20, and the general annual

rate of profit = 20%. Whatever the cost price, k, of the commodities

annually produced by a capital of 100, their price of production would

then  be  k  +  20.  In  those  spheres  of  production  in  which  the

composition  of  capital  would  =  (80  -  x)c  +  (20  +  x)v,  the  actually

produced surplus value, or the annual profit produced in that particular

sphere, would be 20 + x, that is, greater than 20, and the value of the

produced commodities = k + 20 + x, that is, greater than k + 20, or

greater than their price of production. In those spheres, in which the

composition  of  the  capital  =  (80  +  x)c  +  (20  -  x)v,  the  annually

produced surplus value, or profit, would = 20 - x, or less than 20, and

consequently the value of the commodities k + 20 - x less than the

price of production, which = k + 20. Aside from possible differences in

the  periods  of  turnover,  the  price  of  production  of  the  commodities

would then equal their value only in spheres, in which the composition

would happen to be 80c + 20v.

    The  specific  development  of  the  social  productivity  of  labor  in

each particular sphere of production varies in degree, higher or lower,

depending on how large a quantity of means of production are set in

motion by a definite quantity of labor, hence in a given working day bya  definite  number  of  laborers,  and,  consequently,  on  how  small  a

quantity  of  labor  is  required  for  a  given  quantity  of  means  of

production. Such capitals as contain a larger percentage of constant

and a smaller percentage of variable capital than the average social

capital  are,  therefore,  called  capitals  of  higher  composition,  and,

conversely, those capitals in which the constant is relatively smaller,

and the variable relatively greater than in the average social capital,

are called capitals of lower composition. Finally, we call those capitals

whose  composition  coincides  with  the  average,  capitals  of  average

composition. Should the average social capital be composed in per

cent of 80c + 20v, then a capital of 90c + 10v is higher, and a capital

of 70c + 30v lower than the social average. Generally speaking, if the

composition of the average social capital=mc + nv, in which m and n

are constant magnitudes and m + n = 100, the formula (m + x)c + (n -

x)v represents the higher composition, and (m - x)c + (n + x)v the

lower  composition  of  an  individual  capital  or  group  of  capitals.  The

way in which these capitals perform their functions after establishment

of an average rate of profit and assuming one turnover per year, is

shown in the following tabulation, in which I represents the average

composition with an average rate of profit of 20%.

    I) 80v + 20v + 20s. Rate of profit = 20%.

    Price of product = 120. Value = 120.

    II) 90c + 10v + 10s. Rate of profit = 20%.

    Price of product = 120. Value = 110.

    III) 70c + 30v + 30s. Rate of profit = 20%.

    Price of product = 120. Value = 130.

    The  value  of  the  commodities  produced  by  capital  II  would,

therefore,  be  smaller  than  their  price  of  production,  the  price  of

production of the commodities of III smaller than their value, and only

in  the  case  of  capital  I  in  branches  of  production  in  which  the

composition happens to coincide with the social average, would value

and  price  of  production  be  equal.  In  applying  these  terms  to  any

particular cases note must, however, be taken whether a deviation of

the ratio between c and v is simply due to a change in the value of the

elements  of  constant  capital,  rather  than  to  a  difference  in  the

technical composition.    The foregoing statements have at any rate modified the original

assumption  concerning  the  determination  of  the  cost  price  of

commodities.  We  had  originally  assumed  that  the  cost  price  of  a

commodity  equaled  the  value  of  the  commodities  consumed  in  its

production.  But  for  the  buyer  the  price  of  production  of  a  specific

commodity is its cost price, and may thus pass as cost price into the

prices of other commodities. Since the price of production may differ

from  the  value  of  a  commodity,  it  follows  that  the  cost  price  of  a

commodity containing this price of production of another commodity

may also stand above or below that portion of its total value derived

from  the  value  of  the  means  of  production  consumed  by  it.  It  is

necessary to remember this modified significance of the cost price,

and to bear in mind that there is always the possibility of an error if the

cost price of a commodity in any particular sphere is identified with the

value  of  the  means  of  production  consumed  by  it.  Our  present

analysis  does  not  necessitate  a  closer  examination  of  this  point.  It

remains  true,  nevertheless,  that  the  cost  price  of  a  commodity  is

always smaller than its value. For no matter how much the cost price

of a commodity may differ from the value of the means of production

consumed by it, this past mistake is immaterial to the capitalist.

    The cost price of a particular commodity is a definite condition

which is given, and independent of the production of our capitalist,

while the result of his production is a commodity containing surplus

value, therefore an excess of value over and above its cost price. For

all other purposes, the statement that the cost price is smaller than the

value of a commodity has now changed practically into the statement

that the cost price is smaller than the price of production. As concerns

the total social capital, in which the price of production is equal to the

value, this statement is identical with the former, namely that the cost

price is smaller than the value. And while it is modified in the individual

spheres of production, the fundamental fact always remains that in the

case  of  the  total  social  capital  the  cost  price  of  the  commodities

produced by it is smaller than their value, or, in the case of the total

mass  of  social  commodities,  smaller  than  their  price  of  production,

which is identical with their value. The cost price of a commodity refers

only to the quantity of paid labor contained in it, while its value refers

to all the paid and unpaid labor contained in it. The price of productionrefers to the sum of the paid labor plus a certain quantity of unpaid

labor determined for any particular sphere of production by conditions

over which it has no control.

    The formula that the price of production of a commodity = k + p, i.

e., equals its cost price plus profit, is now more precisely defined with

p  =  kp'  (p'  being  the  general  rate  of  profit).  Hence  the  price  of

production  =  k  +  kp’.  If  k  =  300  and  p’  =  15%,  then  the  price  of

production is k + kp’ = 300 + 300 x 15/100, or 345.

    The  price  of  production  of  the  commodities  in  any  particular

sphere may change in magnitude:

    1)  If  the  general  rate  of  profit  changes  independently  of  this

particular  sphere,  while  the  value  of  the  commodities  remains  the

same  (the  same  quantities  of  congealed  and  living  labor  being

consumed in their production as before).

    2) If there is a change of value, either in this particular sphere in

consequence of technical changes, or in consequence of a change in

the  value  of  those  commodities  which  form  the  elements  of  its

constant capital, while the general rate of profit remains unchanged.

    3)  Finally,  if  a  combination  of  the  two  aforementioned

circumstances takes place.

    In spite of the great changes occurring continually, as we shall

see,  in  the  actual  rates  of  profit  within  the  individual  spheres  of

production,  any  real  change  in  the  general  rate  of  profit,  unless

brought  about  by  way  of  an  exception  by  extraordinary  economic

events, is the belated effect of a series of fluctuations extending over

very  long  periods,  fluctuations  which  require  much  time  before

consolidating and equalizing one another to bring about a change in

the  general  rate  of  profit.  In  all  shorter  periods  (quite  aside  from

fluctuations of market prices), a change in the prices of production is,

therefore, always traceable prima facie to actual changes in the value

of  commodities,  i.  e.,  to  changes  in  the  total  amount  of  labor  time

required for their production. Mere changes in the money expression

of the same values are, naturally, not at all considered here.

    On the other hand, it is evident that from the point of view of the

total social capital the value of the commodities produced by it (or,

expressed in money, their price) = value of constant capital + value of

variable  capital  +  surplus  value.  Assuming  the  degree  of  laborexploitation to be constant, the rate of profit cannot change so long as

the mass of surplus value remains the same, unless there is a change

in either the value of the constant capital, the value of the variable

capital,  or  the  value  of  both,  so  that  C  changes,  and  thereby  s/C,

which represents the general rate of profit. In each case, therefore, a

change in the general rate of profit implies a change in the value of

commodities  which  form  the  elements  of  the  constant  or  variable

capital, or of both.

    Or, the general rate of profit may change, while the value of the

commodities remains the same, when the degree of labor exploitation

changes.

    Or,  if  the  degree  of  labor  exploitation  remains  the  same,  the

general rate of profit may change through a change in the amount of

labor employed relative to the constant capital as a result of technical

changes  in  the  labor  process.  But  such  technical  changes  must

always  show  themselves  in,  and  be  attended  by,  a  change  in  the

value of the commodities, whose production would then require more

or less labor than before.

    We saw in Part I that surplus value and profit are identical from

the standpoint of their mass. But the rate of profit is from the very

outset distinct from the rate of surplus value, which appears at first

sight as merely a different form of calculating. But at the same time

this serves, also from the outset, to obscure and mystify the actual

origin of surplus value, since the rate of profit can rise or fall while the

rate of surplus value remains the same, and vice versa, and since the

capitalist is in practice solely interested in the rate of profit. Yet there

was difference of magnitude only between the rate of surplus value

and  the  rate  of  profit  and  not  between  the  surplus  value  itself  and

profit.  Since  in  the  rate  of  profit  the  surplus  value  is  calculated  in

relation to the total capital and the latter is taken as its standard of

measurement, the surplus value itself appears to originate from the

total capital, uniformly derived from all its parts, so that the organic

difference between constant and variable capital is obliterated in the

conception of profit. Disguised as profit, surplus value actually denies

its origin, loses its character, and becomes unrecognizable. However,

hitherto the distinction between profit and surplus value applied solely

to a qualitative change, or change of form, while there was no realdifference  of  magnitude  in  this  first  stage  of  the  change  between

surplus value and profit, but only between the rate of profit and the

rate of surplus value.

    But it is different, as soon as a general rate of profit, and thereby

an average profit corresponding to the magnitude of invested capital

given in the various spheres of production, have been established.

    It is then only an accident if the surplus value, and thus the profit,

actually  produced  in  any  particular  sphere  of  production,  coincides

with the profit contained in the selling price of a commodity. As a rule,

surplus value and profit and not their rates alone, are then different

magnitudes. At a given degree of exploitation, the mass of surplus

value  produced  in  a  particular  sphere  of  production  is  then  more

important for the aggregate average profit of social capital, and thus

for the capitalist class in general, than for the individual capitalist in

any specific branch of production. It is of importance to the latter only

in so far as the quantity of surplus value produced in his branch helps

to  regulate  the  average  profit.  But  this  is  a  process  which  occurs

behind  his  back,  one  he  does  not  see,  nor  understand,  and  which

indeed  does  not  interest  him.  The  actual  difference  of  magnitude

between profit and surplus value — not merely between the rate of

profit  and  the  rate  of  surplus  value  —  in  the  various  spheres  of

production now completely conceals the true nature and origin of profit

not only from the capitalist, who has a special interest in deceiving

himself on this score, but also from the laborer.

    The transformation of values into prices of production serves to

obscure the basis for determining value itself. Finally, since the mere

transformation of surplus value into profit distinguishes the portion of

the value of a commodity forming the profit from the portion forming its

cost price, it is natural that the conception of value should elude the

capitalist at this juncture, for he does not see the total labor put into

the commodity, but only that portion of the total labor for which he has

paid in the shape of means of production, be they living or not, so that

his profit appears to him as something outside the immanent value of

the commodity. Now this idea is fully confirmed, fortified, and ossified

in that, from the standpoint of his particular sphere of production, the

profit added to the cost price is not actually determined by the limits ofthe formation of value within his own sphere, but through completely

outside influences.

    The fact that this intrinsic connection is here revealed for the first

time; that up to the present time political economy, as we shall see in

the following and in Book IV, either forcibly abstracted itself from the

distinctions  between  surplus  value  and  profit,  and  their  rates,  so  it

could retain value determination as a basis, or else abandoned this

value determination and with it all vestiges of a scientific approach, in

order to cling to the differences that strike the eye in this phenomenon

— this confusion of the theorists best illustrates the utter incapacity of

the practical capitalist, blinded by competition as he is, and incapable

of  penetrating  its  phenomena,  to  recognize  the  inner  essence  and

inner structure of this process behind its outer appearance.

    In fact, all the laws evolved in Part I concerning the rise and fall of

the rate of profit have the following two-fold meaning:

    1) On the one hand, they are the laws of the general rate of profit.

In view of the many different causes which make the rate of profit rise

or fall one would think, after everything that has been said and done,

that the general rate of profit must change every day. But a trend in

one sphere of production compensates for that in another, their effects

cross and paralyze one another. We shall later examine to which side

these  fluctuations  ultimately  gravitate.  But  they  are  slow.  The

suddenness, multiplicity, and different duration of the fluctuations in

the individual spheres of production make them compensate for one

another  in  the  order  of  their  succession  in  time,  a  fall  in  prices

following a rise, and vice versa, so that they remain limited to local, i.

e., individual, spheres. Finally, the various local fluctuations neutralize

one another. Within each individual sphere of production, there take

place changes, i. e., deviations from the general rate of profit, which

counterbalance one another in a definite time on the one hand, and

thus have no influence upon the general rate of profit, and which, on

the other, do not react upon it, because they are balanced by other

simultaneous local fluctuations. Since the general rate of profit is not

only determined by the average rate of profit in each sphere, but also

by  the  distribution  of  the  total  social  capital  among  the  different

individual spheres, and since this distribution is continually changing, it

becomes  another  constant  cause  of  change  in  the  general  rate  ofprofit. But it is a cause of change which mostly paralyses itself, owing

to the uninterrupted and many-sided nature of this movement.

    2) Within each sphere, there is some room for play for a longer or

shorter space of time, in which the rate of profit of this sphere may

fluctuate, before this fluctuation consolidates sufficiently after rising or

falling  to  gain  time  for  influencing  the  general  rate  of  profit  and

therefore assuming more than local importance. The laws of the rate

of profit, as developed in Part I of this book, likewise remain applicable

within these limits of space and time.

    The theoretical conception concerning the first transformation of

surplus value into profit, that every part of a capital yields a uniform

profit,  expresses  a  practical  fact.  Whatever  the  composition  of  an

industrial capital, whether it sets in motion one quarter of congealed

labor and three-quarters of living labor, or three-quarters of congealed

labor and one-quarter of living labor, whether in one case it absorbs

three times as much surplus labor, or produces three times as much

surplus value than in another — in either case it yields the same profit,

given  the  same  degree  of  labor  exploitation  and  leaving  aside

individual differences, which, incidentally, disappear because we are

dealing  in  both  cases  with  the  average  composition  of  the  entire

sphere of production. The individual capitalist (or all the capitalists in

each individual sphere of production), whose outlook is limited, rightly

believes that his profit is not derived solely from the labor employed by

him,  or  in  his  line  of  production.  This  is  quite  true,  as  far  as  his

average profit is concerned. To what extent this profit is due to the

aggregate exploitation of labor on the part of the total social capital, i.

e., by all his capitalist colleagues — this interrelation is a complete

mystery to the individual capitalist; all the more so, since no bourgeois

theorists, the political economists, have so far revealed it. A saving of

labor — not only labor necessary to produce a certain product, but

also the number of employed laborers — and the employment of more

congealed  labor  (constant  capital),  appear  to  be  very  sound

operations from the economic standpoint and do not seem to exert the

least  influence  on  the  general  rate  of  profit  and  the  average  profit.

How could living labor be the sole source of profit, in view of the fact

that  a  reduction  in  the  quantity  of  labor  required  for  production

appears not to exert any influence on profit? Moreover, it even seemsin certain circumstances to be the nearest source of an increase of

profits, at least for the individual capitalist.

    If in any particular sphere of production there is a rise or fall of the

portion of the cost price which represents the value of constant capital,

this  portion  comes  from  the  circulation  and,  either  enlarged  or

reduced, passes from the very outset into the process of production of

the commodity. If, on the other hand, the same number of laborers

produces more or less in the same time, so that the quantity of labor

required for the production of a definite quantity of commodities varies

while the number of laborers remains the same, that portion of the

cost  price  which  represents  the  value  of  the  variable  capital  may

remain the same, i. e., contribute the same amount to the cost price of

tho total product. But every one of the individual commodities whose

sum makes up the total product, shares in more or less labor (paid

and therefore also unpaid), and shares consequently in the greater or

smaller outlay for this labor, i. e., a 1arger or smaller portion of the

wage. The total wages paid by the capitalist remain the same, but

wages differ if calculated per piece of the commodity. Thus, there is a

change  in  this  portion  of  the  cost  price  of  the  commodity.  But  no

matter whether the cost price of the individual commodity (or, perhaps,

the cost price of the sum of commodities produced by a capital of a

given magnitude) rises or falls, be it due to such changes in its own

value,  or  in  that  of  its  elements,  the  average  profit  of,  e.g.,  10%

remains  10%.  Still,  10%  of  an  individual  commodity  may  represent

very  different  amounts,  depending  on  the  change  of  magnitude

caused in the cost price of the individual commodity by such changes

of value as we have assumed.

    So far as the variable capital is concerned — and this is most

important,  because  it  is  the  source  of  surplus  value,  and  because

anything which conceals its relation to the accumulation of wealth by

the capitalist serves to mystify the entire system — matters get cruder

or appear to the capitalist in the following light: A variable capital of

£100 represents the weekly wage of, say, 100 laborers. If these 100

laborers  weekly  produce  200  pieces  of  a  commodity  =  200C,  in  a

given working time, then 1C — abstracted from that portion of its cost

price  which  is  added  by  the  constant  capital,  costs  £100/200  =  10

shillings, since £100 = 200C. Now suppose that a change occurs inthe  productiveness  of  labor.  Suppose  it  doubles,  so  that  the  same

number  of  laborers  now  produces  twice  200C  in  the  time  which  it

previously took to produce 200C. In that case (considering only that

part of the cost price which consists of wages) 1C = £100/400 = 5

shillings,  since  now  £100  =  400C.  Should  the  productiveness

decrease one-half, the same labor would produce only 200C/2 and

since £100 = 200C/2, 1C = £200/2 = £1. The changes in the labor time

required  for  the  production  of  the  commodities,  and  hence  the

changes in their value, thus appear in regard to the cost price, and

hence to the price of production, as a different distribution of the same

wage  for  more  or  fewer  commodities,  depending  on  the  greater  or

smaller quantity of commodities produced in the same working time

for  the  same  wage.  What  the  capitalist,  and  consequently  also  the

political economist, see is that the part of the paid labor per piece of

commodity changes with the productivity of labor, and that the value of

each piece also changes accordingly.

    What they do not see is that the same applies to unpaid labor

contained in very piece of the commodity, and this is perceived so

much  less  since  the  average  profit  actually  is  only  accidentally

determined  by  the  unpaid  labor  absorbed  in  the  sphere  of  the

individual capitalist. It is only in such crude and meaningless form that

we can glimpse that the value of commodities is determined by the

labor contained in them.          Chapter 10: Equalization of The General Rate of Profit

Through Competition. Market Prices and Market Values. Surplus

                                        Profit



    The capital invested in some spheres of production has a mean,

or average, composition, that is, it has the same, or almost the same

composition as the average social capital.

    In these spheres the price of production is exactly or almost the

same as the value of the produced commodity expressed in money. If

there were no other way of reaching a mathematical limit, this would

be the one. Competition so distributes the social capital among the

various spheres of production that the prices of production in each

sphere take shape according to the model of the prices of production

in these spheres of average composition, i.e., they = k + kp’ (cost

price plus the average rate of profit multiplied by the cost price). This

average  rate  of  profit,  however,  is  the  percentage  of  profit  in  that

sphere  of  average  composition  in  which  profit,  therefore,  coincides

with surplus value. Hence, the rate of profit is the same in all spheres

of production, for it is equalized on the basis of those average spheres

of  production  which  has  the  average  composition  of  capital.

Consequently, the sum of the profits in all spheres of production must

equal the sum of the surplus values, and the sum of the prices of

production of the total social product equal the sum of its value. But it

is evident that the balance among spheres of production of different

composition must tend to equalize them with the spheres of average

composition, be it exactly or only approximately the same as the social

average.  Between  the  spheres  more  or  less  approximating  the

average there is again a tendency toward equalization, seeking the

ideal  average,  i.e.,  an  average  that  does  not  really  exist,  i.e.,  a

tendency to take this ideal as a standard. In this way the tendency

necessarily prevails to make the prices of production merely converted

forms of value, or to turn profits into mere portions of surplus value.

However, these are not distributed in proportion to the surplus valueproduced in each special sphere of production, but rather in proportion

to the mass of capital employed in each sphere, so that equal masses

of capital, whatever their composition, receive equal aliquot shares of

the total surplus value produced by the total social capital.

    In  the  case  of  capitals  of  average,  or  approximately  average,

composition, the price of production is thus the same or almost the

same  as  the  value,  and  the  profit  the  same  as  the  surplus  value

produced by them. All other capitals, of whatever composition, tend

toward  this  average  under  pressure  of  competition.  But  since  the

capitals of average composition are of the same, or approximately the

same,  structure  as  the  average  social  capital,  all  capitals  have  the

tendency, regardless of the surplus value produced by them, to realize

the average profit, rather than their own surplus value in the price of

their commodity, i.e., to realize the prices of production.

    On the other hand, it may be said that wherever an average profit,

and therefore a general rate of profit, is produced — no matter by

what  means  —  such  an  average  profit  cannot  be  anything  but  the

profit on the average social capital, whose sum is equal to the sum of

surplus value. Moreover, the prices obtained by adding this average

profit to the cost prices cannot be anything but the values transmuted

into prices of production. Nothing would be altered if capitals in certain

spheres of production would not, for some reason, be subject to the

process of equalization. The average profit would then be computed

on  that  portion  of  the  social  capital  which  enters  the  equalization

process. It is evident that the average profit can be nothing but the

total mass of surplus values allotted to the various quantities of capital

proportionally  to  their  magnitudes  in  their  different  spheres  of

production. It is the total realized unpaid labor, and this total mass, like

the  paid,  congealed  or  living,  labor,  obtains  in  the  total  mass  of

commodities and money that falls to the capitalists.

    The  really  difficult  question  is  this:  how  is  this  equalization  of

profits into a general rate of profit brought about, since it is obviously a

result rather than a point of departure?

    To  begin  with,  an  estimate  of  the  values  of  commodities,  for

instance in terms of money, can obviously only be the result of their

exchange. If, therefore, we assume such an estimate, we must regard

it  as  the  outcome  of  an  actual  exchange  of  commodity  value  forcommodity value. But how does this exchange of commodities at their

real value come about?

    Let us first assume that all commodities in the different branches

of production are sold at their real values. What would then be the

outcome?  According  to  the  foregoing,  very  different  rates  of  profit

would then reign in the various spheres of production. It is prima facie

two entirely different matters whether commodities are sold at their

values (i.e., exchanged in proportion to the value contained in them at

prices corresponding to their value), or whether they are sold at such

prices  that  their  sale  yields  equal  profits  for  equal  masses  of  the

capital advanced for their respective production.

    The fact that capitals employing unequal amounts of living labor

produce unequal amounts of surplus value, presupposes at least to a

certain  extent  that  the  degree  of  exploitation  or  the  rate  of  surplus

value  are  the  same,  or  that  any  existing  differences  in  them  are

equalized  by  real  or  imaginary  (conventional)  grounds  of

compensation. This would assume competition among laborers and

equalization  through  their  continual  migration  from  one  sphere  of

production to another. Such a general rate of surplus value — viewed

as a tendency, like all other economic laws — has been assumed by

us for the sake of theoretical simplification. But in reality it is an actual

premise of the capitalist mode of production, although it is more or

less  obstructed  by  practical  frictions  causing  more  or  less

considerable local differences, such as the settlement laws for farm

laborers  in  Britain.  But  in  theory  it  is  assumed  that  the  laws  of

capitalist production operate in their pure form. In reality there exists

only approximation; but, this approximation is the greater, the more

developed  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  and  the  less  it  is

adulterated  and  amalgamated  with  survivals  of  former  economic

conditions.

    The whole difficulty arises from the fact that commodities are not

exchanged simply as commodities, but as products of capitals, which

claim participation in the total amount of surplus value, proportional to

their  magnitude,  or  equal  if  they  are  of  equal  magnitude.  And  this

claim is to be satisfied by the total price for commodities produced by

a given capital in a certain space of time. This total price is, however,only the sum of the prices of the individual commodities produced by

this capital.

    The punctum sapiens  will  be  best  brought  if  we  approach  the

matter as follows: suppose, the laborers themselves are in possession

of  their  respective  means  of  production  and  exchange  their

commodities with one another. In that case these commodities would

not be products of capital. The value of the various means of labor

and raw materials would differ in accordance with the technical nature

of  the  labors  performed  in  the  different  branches  of  production.

Furthermore, aside from the unequal value of the means of production

employed by them, they would require different quantities of means of

production  for  given  quantities  of  labor,  depending  on  whether  a

certain commodity can be finished in one hour, another in one day,

and so forth. Also suppose the laborers work an equal average length

of time, allowing for compensations that arise from the different labor

intensities, etc. In such a case, two laborers would, first, both have

replaced  their  outlays,  the  cost  prices  of  the  consumed  means  of

production,  in  the  commodities  which  make  up  the  product  of  their

day’s work. These outlays would differ, depending on the technical

nature of their labor. Secondly, both of them would have created equal

amounts of new value, namely the working day added by them to the

means of production.

    This would comprise their wages plus the surplus value, the latter

representing surplus labor over and above their necessary wants, the

product of which would however belong to them. To put it the capitalist

way, both of them receive the same wages plus the same profit, or the

same value, expressed, say, by the product of a ten-hour working day.

But in the first place, the values of their commodities would have to

differ. In commodity I, for instance, the portion of value corresponding

to  the  consumed  means  of  production  might  be  higher  than  in

commodity  II.  And,  to  introduce  all  possible  differences,  we  might

assume  right  now  that  commodity  I  absorbs  more  living  labor,  and

consequently  requires  more  labor  time  to  be  produced,  than

commodity II. The values of commodities I and II are, therefore, very

different. So are the sums of the values of the commodities, which

represent the product of the labor performed by laborers I and II in a

given time. The rates of profit would also differ considerably for I and IIif we take the rate of profit to be the proportion of the surplus value to

the total value of the invested means of production.

    The  means  of  subsistence  daily  consumed  by  I  and  II  during

production, which take the place of wages, here form the part of the

invested means of production ordinarily called variable capital. But for

equal working periods the surplus values would be the same for I and

II,  or,  more  precisely,  since  I  and  II  each  receive  the  value  of  the

product of a day’s work, both of them receive equal values after the

value of the invested "constant" elements has been deducted, and one

portion of those equal values may be regarded as a substitute for the

means  of  subsistence  consumed  in  production,  and  the  other  as

surplus value in excess of it. If laborer I has greater expenses, they

are made good by a greater portion of the value of his commodity,

which replaces this "constant " part, and he therefore has to reconvert

a  larger  portion  of  the  total  value  of  his  product  into  the  material

elements of this constant part, while laborer II, though receiving less

for  this,  has  so  much  less  to  reconvert.  In  these  circumstances,  a

difference in the rates of profit would therefore be immaterial, just as it

is immaterial to the wage laborer today what rate of profit may express

the  amount  of  surplus  value  filched  from  him,  and  just  as  in

international commerce the difference in the various national rates of

profit is immaterial to commodity exchange.

    The exchange of commodities at their values, or approximately at

their values, thus requires a much lower stage than their exchange at

their prices of production, which requires a definite level of capitalist

development.

    Whatever the manner in which the prices of various commodities

are  first  mutually  fixed  or  regulated,  their  movements  are  always

governed  by  the  law  of  value.  If  the  labor  time  required  for  their

production happens to shrink, prices fall; if it increases, prices rise,

provided other conditions remain the same.

    Apart from the domination of prices and price movement by the

law  of  value,  it  is  quite  appropriate  to  regard  the  values  of

commodities as not only theoretically but also historically prius to the

prices of production. This applies to conditions in which the laborer

owns his means of production, and this is the condition of the land-

owning  farmer  living  off  his  own  labor  and  the  craftsman,  in  theancient as well as in the modern world. This agrees also with the view

we  expressed  previously  that  the  evolution  of  products  into

commodities arises through exchange between different communities,

not between the members of the same community. It holds not only for

this primitive condition, but also for subsequent conditions, based on

slavery and serfdom, and for the guild organization of handicrafts, so

long as the means of production involved in each branch of production

can be transferred from one sphere to another only with difficulty and

therefore the various spheres of production are related to one another,

within certain limits, as foreign countries or communist communities.

    For prices at which commodities are exchanged to approximately

correspond to their values, nothing more is necessary than 1) for the

exchange of the various commodities to cease being purely accidental

or  only  occasional;  2)  so  far  as  direct  exchange  of  commodities  is

concerned, for these commodities to be produced on both sides in

approximately  sufficient  quantities  to  meet  mutual  requirements,

something learned from mutual experience in trading and therefore a

natural  outgrowth  of  continued  trading;  and  3)  so  far  as  selling  is

concerned, for no natural or artificial monopoly to enable either of the

contracting sides to sell commodities above their value or to compel

them  to  undersell.  By  accidental  monopoly  we  mean  a  monopoly

which a buyer or seller acquires through an accidental state of supply

and demand.

    The assumption that the commodities of the various spheres of

production are sold at their value merely implies, of course, that their

value is the center of gravity around which their prices fluctuate, and

their  continual  rises  and  drops  tend  to  equalize.  There  is  also  the

market  value  —  of  which  later  —  to  be  distinguished  from  the

individual  value  of  particular  commodities  produced  by  different

producers. The individual value of some of these commodities will be

below their market value (that is, less labor time is required for their

production than expressed is the market value) while that of others will

exceed  the  market  value.  On  the  one  hand,  market  value  is  to  be

viewed  as  the  average  value  of  commodities  produced  in  a  single

sphere, and, on the other, as the individual value of the commodities

produced  under  average  conditions  of  their  respective  sphere  and

forming  the  bulk  of  the  products  of  that  sphere.  It  is  only  inextraordinary  combinations  that  commodities  produced  under  the

worst,  or  the  most  favorable,  conditions  regulate  the  market  value,

which, in turn, forms the center of fluctuation for market prices. The

latter, however, are the same for commodities of the same kind. If the

ordinary demand is satisfied by the supply of commodities of average

value, hence of a value midway between the two extremes, then the

commodities whose individual value is below the market value realize

an extra surplus value, or surplus profit, while those, whose individual

value exceeds the market value, are unable to realize a portion of the

surplus value contained in them.

    It  does  no  good  to  say  that  the  sale  of  commodities  produced

under the least favorable conditions proves that they are required to

satisfy the demand. If in the assumed case the price were higher than

the average market value, the demand would be smaller. At a certain

price, a commodity occupies just so much place on the market. This

place remains the same in case of a price change only if the higher

price is accompanied by a drop in the supply of the commodity, and a

lower price by an increase of supply. And if the demand is so great

that it does not contract when the price is regulated by the value of

commodities  produced  under  the  least  favorable  conditions,  then

these determine the market value. This is not possible unless demand

is greater than usual, or if supply drops below the usual level. Finally,

if  the  mass  of  the  produced  commodities  exceeds  the  quantity

disposed  of  at  average  market  values,  the  commodities  produced

under the most favorable conditions regulate the market value. They

may, for example, be sold exactly or approximately at their individual

value,  in  which  case  the  commodities  produced  under  the  least

favorable conditions may not even realize their cost price, while those

produced  under  average  conditions  realize  only  a  portion  of  the

surplus value contained in them.

    What has been said here of market value applies to the price of

production as soon as it takes the place of market value. The price of

production  is  regulated  in  each  sphere,  and  likewise  regulated  by

special circumstances. And this price of production is, in its turn, the

center  around  which  the  daily  market  prices  fluctuate  and  tend  to

equalize one another within definite periods [...]

    No matter how the prices are regulated, we arrive at the following:    1) The law of value dominates price movements with reductions

or increases in required labor time making prices of production fall or

rise [...]

    2) The average profit determining the prices of production must

always be approximately equal to that quantity of surplus value which

falls to the share of individual capital in its capacity of an aliquot part of

the total social capital. Suppose that the general rate of profit, and

therefore the average profit, are expressed by money value greater

than the money value of the actual average surplus value. So far as

the  capitalists  are  concerned,  it  is  then  immaterial  whether  they

reciprocally  charge  10  or  15%  profit.  Neither  of  these  percentages

covers  more  actual  commodity  value  than  the  other,  since  the

overcharge in money is mutual. As for the laborer (the assumption

being that he receives his normal wage and the rise in the average

profit does not therefore imply an actual deduction from his wage, i.e.,

it expresses something entirely different from the normal surplus value

of the capitalist), the rise in commodity prices caused by an increase

of  the  average  profit  must  correspond  to  the  rise  of  the  money

expression of the variable capital. Such a general nominal increase in

the rate of profit and the average profit above the limit provided by the

ratio of the actual surplus value to the total invested capital is not, in

effect, possible without causing an increase in wages, and also an

increase  in  the  prices  of  commodities  forming  the  constant  capital.

The reverse is true in case of a reduction. Since the total value of the

commodities  regulates  the  total  surplus  value,  and  this  in  turn

regulates the level of average profit and thereby the general rate of

profit — as a general law or a law governing fluctuations — it follows

the law of value regulates the prices of production.

    What  competition,  first  in  a  single  sphere,  achieves  is  a  single

market  value  and  market  price  derived  from  the  various  individual

values  of  commodities.  And  it  is  competition  of  capitals  in  different

spheres, which first brings out the price of production equalizing the

rates of profit in the different spheres. The latter process requires a

higher development of capitalist production that the previous one.

    For  commodities  of  the  same  sphere  of  production,  the  same

kind, and approximately the same quality, to be sold at their values [...]

the different individual values must be equalized at one social value,the above-named market value, and this implies competition among

producers  of  the  same  kind  of  commodities  and,  likewise,  the

existence of a common market in which they offer their articles for

sale. For the market price of identical commodities, each, however,

produced under different individual circumstances, to correspond to

the market value and not to deviate from it either by rising above or

falling below it, it is necessary that the pressure exerted by different

sellers upon one another be sufficient to bring enough commodities to

market to fill the social requirements, i.e., a quantity for which society

is capable of paying the market value. Should the mass of products

exceed this demand, the commodities would have to be sold below

their market value; and conversely, above their market value if the

mass of products were not large enough to meet the demand, or, what

amounts to the same, if the pressure of competition among sellers

were  not  strong  enough  to  bring  this  mass  of  products  to  market.

Should the market value change, this would also entail a change in

the conditions on which the total mass of commodities could be sold.

Should the market value fall, this would entail a rise in the average

social  demand  (this  always  taken  to  mean  the  effective  demand),

which  could,  within  certain  limits,  absorb  larger  masses  of

commodities. Should the market value rise, this would entail a drop in

the  social  demand,  and  a  smaller  mass  of  commodities  would  be

absorbed. Hence, if supply and demand regulate the market price, or

rather the deviations of the market price from the market value, then,

in turn, the market value regulates the ratio of supply to demand, or

the  center  round  which  fluctuations  of  supply  and  demand  cause

market prices to oscillate.

    Looking closer, we find that the conditions applicable to the value

of  an  individual  commodity  are  here  reproduced  as  conditions

governing the value of the aggregate of a certain kind of commodity.

Capitalist  production  is  mass  production  from  the  very  outset.  But

even  in  other,  less  developed,  modes  of  production  that  which  is

produced in relatively small quantities as a common product by small-

scale, even if numerous, producers, is concentrated in large quantities

— at least in the case of the vital commodities — in the hands of

relatively few merchants. The latter accumulate them and sell them asthe common product of an entire branch of production, or of a more or

less considerable contingent of it.

    It should be here noted in passing that the "social demand,” i.e.,

the  factor  which  regulates  the  principle  of  demand,  is  essentially

subject  to  the  mutual  relationship  of  the  different  classes  and  their

respective economic position, notably therefore to, firstly, the ratio of

total  surplus  value  to  wages,  and,  secondly,  to  the  relation  of  the

various  parts  into  which  surplus  value  is  split  up  (profit,  interest,

ground rent, taxes, etc.). And this thus again shows how absolutely

nothing can be explained by the relation of supply to demand before

ascertaining the basis on which this relation rests [...]

    The matter will be most readily pictured by regarding this whole

mass of commodities, produced by one branch of industry, as one

commodity,  and  the  sum  of  the  prices  of  the  many  identical

commodities as one price. Then, whatever has been said of a single

commodity applies literally to the mass of commodities of an entire

branch of production available in the market. The requirement that the

individual value of a commodity should correspond to its social value

is now realized, or further determined, in that the mass contains social

labor necessary for its production, and that the value of this mass is

equal to its market value.

    Now  suppose  that  the  bulk  of  these  commodities  is  produced

under  approximately  similar  normal  social  conditions,  so  that  this

value  is  at  the  same  time  the  individual  value  of  the  individual

commodities which make up this mass. If a relatively small portion of

these commodities may now have been produced below, and another

above, these conditions, so that the individual value of one portion is

greater, and that of the other smaller, than the average value of the

bulk of the commodities, but in such proportions that these extremes

balance one another, so that the average value of the commodities at

these extremes is equal to the value of commodities in the center,

then the market value is determined by the value of the commodities

produced under average conditions. The value of the entire mass of

commodities is equal to the actual sum of the values of all individual

commodities  taken  together,  whether  produced  under  average

conditions, or under conditions above or below the average. In that

case, the market value, or social value, of the mass of commodities —the necessary labor time contained in them — is determined by the

value of the preponderant mean mass.

    Suppose, on the contrary, that the total mass of the commodities

in question brought to market remains the same, while the value of the

commodities produced under less favorable conditions fails to balance

out  the  value  of  commodities  produced  under  more  favorable

conditions, so that the part of the mass produced under less favorable

conditions forms a relatively weighty quantity as compared with the

average  mass  and  with  the  other  extreme.  In  that  case,  the  mass

produced  under  less  favorable  conditions  regulates  the  market,  or

social, value [...]

    Under capitalist production it is not merely a matter of obtaining

an equal mass of value in another form — be it that of money or some

other commodity — for a mass of values thrown into circulation in the

form of a commodity, but it is rather a matter of realizing as much

surplus value, or profit, on capital advanced for production, as any

other capital of the same magnitude, or pro rata to its magnitude in

whichever  line  it  is  applied.  It  is,  therefore,  a  matter,  at  least  as  a

minimum, of selling the commodities at prices which yield the average

profit,  i.e.,  at  prices  of  production.  In  this  form  capital  becomes

conscious  of  itself  as  a  social  power  in  which  every  capitalist

participates proportionally to his share in the total social capital.

    First, capitalist production is in itself indifferent to the particular

use value, and distinctive features of any commodity it produces. In

every sphere of production, it is only concerned with producing surplus

value,  and  appropriating  a  certain  quantity  of  unpaid  labor

incorporated in the product of labor. And it is likewise in the nature of

the  wage  labor  subordinated  by  capital  that  it  is  indifferent  to  the

specific character of its labor and must submit to being transformed in

accordance with the requirements of capital and to being transferred

from one sphere of production to another.

    Second, one sphere of production is, in fact, just as good or just

as  bad  as  another.  Every  one  of  them  yields  the  same  profit,  and

every one of them would be useless if the commodities it produced did

not satisfy some social need.

    Now, if the commodities are sold at their values, then, as we have

shown,  very  different  rates  of  profit  arise  in  the  various  spheres  ofproduction,  depending  on  the  different  organic  composition  of  the

masses  of  capital  invested  in  them.  But  capital  withdraws  from  a

sphere  with  a  low  rate  of  profit  and  invades  others,  which  yield  a

higher  profit.  Through  this  incessant  outflow  and  influx,  or,  briefly,

through its distribution among the various spheres, which depends on

how the rate of profit falls here and rises there, it creates such a ratio

of supply to demand that the average profit in the various spheres of

production becomes the same, and values are, therefore, converted

into prices of production. Capital succeeds in this equalization, to a

greater  or  lesser  degree,  depending  on  the  extent  of  capitalist

development in the given nation; i.e., on the extent the conditions in

the  country  in  question  are  adapted  for  the  capitalist  mode  of

production. With the progress of capitalist production, it also develops

its own conditions and subordinates to its specific character and its

immanent  laws  all  the  social  prerequisites  on  which  the  production

process is based.

    The  incessant  equilibration  of  constant  divergences  is

accomplished so much more quickly, 1) the more mobile the capital,

i.e., the more easily it can be shifted from one sphere and from one

place to another; 2) the more quickly labor power can be transferred

from  one  sphere  to  another  and  from  one  production  locality  to

another. The first condition implies complete freedom of trade within

the society and the removal of all monopolies with the exception of the

natural ones, those, that is, which naturally arise out of the capitalist

mode of production. It implies, furthermore, the development of the

credit  system,  which  concentrates  the  inorganic  mass  of  the

disposable  social  capital  vis-a-vis  the  individual  capitalist.  Finally,  it

implies the subordination of the various spheres of production to the

control of capitalists. This last implication is included in our premises,

since we assumed that it was a matter of converting values into prices

of production in all capitalistically exploited spheres of production. But

this  equilibration  itself  runs  into  greater  obstacles,  whenever

numerous and large spheres of production not operated on a capitalist

basis (such as soil cultivation by small farmers), filter in between the

capitalist enterprises and become linked with them. A great density of

population is another requirement. The second condition implies the

abolition of all laws preventing the laborers from transferring from onesphere  of  production  to  another  and  from  one  local  center  of

production to another; indifference of the laborer to the nature of his

labor;  the  greatest  possible  reduction  of  labor  in  all  spheres  of

production to simple labor; the elimination of all vocational prejudices

among laborers; and last but not least, a subjugation of the laborer to

the capitalist mode of production. Further reference to this belongs to

a special analysis of competition [...]

    The  average  profit  coincides  with  the  average  surplus  value

produced for each 100 of capital, and so far as the surplus value is

concerned the foregoing statements apply as a matter of course. In

the  case  of  the  average  profit  the  value  of  the  advanced  capital

becomes an additional element determining the rate of profit. In fact,

the  direct  interest  taken  by  the  capitalist,  or  the  capital,  of  any

individual sphere of production in the exploitation of the laborers who

are  directly  employed  is  confined  to  making  an  extra  gain,  a  profit

exceeding  the  average,  either  through  exceptional  overwork,  or

reduction of the wage below the average, or through the exceptional

productivity of the labor employed [...]

    Here,  then,  we  have  a  mathematically  precise  proof  why

capitalists  form  a  veritable  freemason  society  vis-a-vis  the  whole

working  class,  while  there  is  little  love  lost  between  them  in

competition among themselves.

    The price of production includes the average profit. We call it price

of production. It is really what Adam Smith calls natural price, Ricardo

calls price of production, or cost of production, and the physiocrats call

prix nécessaire, because in the long run it is a prerequisite of supply,

of  the  reproduction  of  commodities  in  every  individual  sphere.  But

none of them has revealed the difference between price of production

and value [...]

    Our analysis has revealed how the market value (and everything

said concerning it applies with appropriate modifications to the price of

production) embraces a surplus profit for those who produce in any

particular sphere of production under the most favorable conditions.

With the exception of crises, and of overproduction in general, this

applies to all market prices, no matter how much they may deviate

from  market  values  or  market  prices  of  production.  For  the  market

price signifies that the same price is paid for commodities of the samekind,  although  they  may  have  been  produced  under  very  different

individual conditions and hence may have different cost prices. (We

do not speak at this point of any surplus profits due to monopolies in

the usual sense of the term, whether natural or artificial.)

    A surplus profit may also arise if certain spheres of production are

in  a  position  to  evade  the  conversion  of  the  values  of  their

commodities into prices of production, and thus the reduction of their

profits to the average profit. We shall devote more attention to the

further modifications of these two forms of surplus profit in the part

dealing with ground rent.      Chapter 11: Effects of General Wage Fluctuations On Prices

                                  of Production



    Let the average composition of social capital be 80c + 20v, and

the  profit  20%.  The  rate  of  surplus  value  is  then  100%.  A  general

increase of wages, all else remaining the same, is tantamount to a

reduction in the rate of surplus value. In the case of average capital,

profit and surplus value are identical. Let wages rise 25%. Then the

same quantity of labor, formerly set in motion with 20, will cost 25. We

shall then have a turnover value of 80c + 25v + 15p, instead of 80c +

20v + 20p. As before, the labor set in motion by the variable capital

produces a value of 40. If v rises from 20 to 25, the surplus s, or p, will

amount to only 15. The profit of 15 on a capital of 105 is 14 2/7%, and

this  would  be  the  new  average  rate  of  profit.  Since  the  price  of

production of commodities produced by the average capital coincides

with their value, the price of production of these commodities would

have  remained  unchanged.  A  wage  increase  would  therefore  have

caused a drop in profit, but no change in the value and price of the

commodities.

    Formerly,  as  long  as  the  average  profit  was  20%,  the  price  of

production  of  commodities  produced  in  one  period  of  turnover  was

equal  to  their  cost  price  plus  a  profit  of  20%  on  this  cost  price,

therefore  =  k  +  kp'  =  k  +  20k/100.  In  this  formula  k  is  a  variable

magnitude, changing in accordance with the value of the means of

production  that  go  into  the  commodities,  and  with  the  amount  of

depreciation given up by the fixed capital to the product. The price of

production would then amount to k + 14 2/7 k/100. Let us now select a

capital, whose composition is lower than the original composition of

the average social capital of 80c + 20v (which has now changed into

76  4/21c  +  23  17/21v);  say,  50c  +  50v.  In  this  case,  the  price  of

production of the annual product before the wage increase would have

been 50c + 50v + 20p = 120, assuming for the sake of simplicity that

the entire fixed capital passes through depreciation into the productand that the period of turnover is the same as in the first case. For the

same quantity of labor set in motion a wage increase of 25% means

an  increase  of  the  variable  capital  from  50  to  62XA  If  the  annual

product were sold at the former price of production of 120, this would

give us 50c + 62 v + 7 p, or a rate of profit of 6%%. But the new
                    1/21/2

average  rate  of  profit  is  14  2/7%,  and  since  we  assume  all  other

circumstances to remain the same, the capital of 50c + 62 v must
                                                                              1/2

also make this profit. Now a capital of 112 makes a profit of 16 1/14
                                                      1/2

at a rate of profit of 14 2/7%. Therefore, the price of production of the

commodities produced by this capital is now 50c + 62 v + 16p =
                                                                        1/21/4

128 8/14. Owing to a wage rise of 255, the price of production of the

same  quantity  of  the  same  commodities,  therefore,  has  here  risen

from 120 to 128 8/14, or more than 7%.

      Conversely, suppose we take a sphere of production of a higher

composition  than  the  average  capital;  say,  92c  +  8v.  The  original

average profit in this case would still be 20, and if we again assume

that the entire fixed capital passes into the annual product and that the

period  of  turnover  is  the  same  as  in  cases  I  and  II,  the  price  of

production of the commodity is here also 120.

    Owing  to  the  rise  in  wages  of  25%  the  variable  capital  for  the

same  quantity  of  labor  rises  from  8  to  10,  the  cost  price  of  the

commodities  from  100  to  102,  while  the  average  rate  of  profit  falls

from 20% to 14 2/7%. But 100:14 2/7 = 102:14 4/7. The profit now

falling to the share of 102 is therefore 14 4/7. For this reason, the total

product  sells  at  k  +  kp’  =  102  +  14  4/7  =  116  4/7.  The  price  of

production has therefore fallen from 120 to 116 4/7, or 3 3/7.

    Consequently, if wages are raised 25%:

    1)  the  price  of  production  of  the  commodities  of  a  capital  of

average social composition does not change;

    2) the price of production of the commodities of a capital of lower

composition rises, but not in proportion to the fall in profit;

    3) the price of production of the commodities of a capital of higher

composition falls, but also not in the same proportion as profit.

    Since the price of production of the commodities of the average

capital remained the same, equal to the value of the product, the sum

of the prices of production of the products of all capitals remained the

same as well, and equal to the sum total of the values produced bythe aggregate capital. The increase on one side and the decrease on

the other balance for the aggregate capital on the level of the average

social capital.

    If the price of production rises in case II and falls in case III, these

opposite effects alone, which are brought about by a fall in the rate of

surplus value or by a general wage increase, show that this cannot be

a matter of compensation in the price for the rise in wages, since the

fall  in  the  price  of  production  in  case  III  cannot  compensate  the

capitalist for the fall in profit, and since the rise of the price in case II

does not prevent a fall in profit. Rather, in either case, whether the

price rises or falls, the profit remains the same as that of the average

capital, in which case the price remains unchanged. It is the same

average profit which has fallen by 5 5/7, or somewhat over 25%, in the

case of II as well as III. It follows from this that if the price did not rise

in II and fall in III, II would have to sell below and III above the new

reduced average profit. It is self-evident that, depending on whether

50, 25, or 10 per 100 units of capital are laid out for wages, the effect

of a wage increase on a capitalist who has invested 1/10 of his capital

in wages must be quite different from that on one who has invested %

or %. An increase in the price of production on the one side, a fall on

the other, depending on a capital being below or above the average

social composition, occurs solely by virtue of the process of levelling

the profit to the new reduced average profit [...]

    [...]    PART 3: THE LAW OF THE TENDENCY OF THE RATE

                            OF PROFIT TO FALL                            Chapter 13: The Law as Such



    Assuming a given wage and working day, a variable capital, for

instance of 100, represents a certain number of employed laborers. It

is  the  index  of  this  number.  Suppose  £100  are  the  wages  of  100

laborers for, say, one week. If these laborers perform equal amounts

of necessary and surplus labor, if they work daily as many hours for

themselves, i.e., for the reproduction of their wage, as they do for the

capitalist, i.e., for the production of surplus value, then the value of

their total product = £200, and the surplus value they produce would

amount to £100. The rate of surplus value, s/v, would = 100%. But, as

we have seen, this rate of surplus value would nonetheless express

itself  in  very  different  rates  of  profit,  depending  on  the  different

volumes of constant capital c and consequently of the total capital C,

because the rate of profit = s/C. The rate of surplus value is 100%:

    If c = 50, and v = 100, then p’ = 100/150 = 66%;
                                                                2/3

    c = 100, and v = 100, then p’ = 100/200 = 50%;

    c = 200, and v = 100, then p’ = 100/300 = 33%;
                                                              1/3

    c = 300, and v = 100, then p’ = 100/400 = 25%;

    c = 400, and v = 100, then p’ = 100/500 = 20%.

    This is how the same rate of surplus value would express itself

under the same degree of labor exploitation in a falling rate of profit,

because  the  material  growth  of  the  constant  capital  implies  also  a

growth  —  albeit  not  in  the  same  proportion  —  in  its  value,  and

consequently in that of the total capital.

    If it is further assumed that this gradual change in the composition

of capital is not confined only to individual spheres of production, but

that it occurs more or less in all, or at least in the key spheres of

production,  so  that  it  involves  changes  in  the  average  organic

composition of the total capital of a certain society, then the gradual

growth  of  constant  capital  in  relation  to  variable  capital  must

necessarily lead to a gradual fall of the general rate of profit, so long

as the rate of surplus value, or the intensity of exploitation of labor by

capital,  remain  the  same.  Now  we  have  seen  that  it  is  a  law  of

capitalist  production  that  its  development  is  attended  by  a  relativedecrease of variable in relation to constant capital, and consequently

to the total capital set in motion. This is just another way of saying that

owing  to  the  distinctive  methods  of  production  developing  in  the

capitalist system the same number of laborers, i.e., the same quantity

of labor power set in motion by a variable capital of a given value,

operate, work up and productively consume in the same time span an

ever-increasing  quantity  of  means  of  labor,  machinery  and  fixed

capital of all sorts, raw and auxiliary materials — and consequently a

constant capital of an ever-increasing value.

    This continual relative decrease of the variable capital vis-à-vis

the constant, and consequently the total capital, is identical with the

progressively  higher  organic  composition  of  the  social  capital  in  its

average.  It  is  likewise  just  another  expression  for  the  progressive

development of the social productivity of labor, which is demonstrated

precisely by the fact that the same number of laborers, in the same

time, i.e., with less labor, convert an ever-increasing quantity of raw

and auxiliary materials into products, thanks to the growing application

of machinery and fixed capital in general. To this growing quantity of

value of the constant capital — although indicating the growth of the

real  mass  of  use  values  of  which  the  constant  capital  materially

consists only approximately — corresponds a progressive cheapening

of products. Every individual product, considered by itself, contains a

smaller quantity of labor than it did on a lower level of production,

where  the  capital  invested  in  wages  occupies  a  far  greater  place

compared  to  the  capital  invested  in  means  of  production.  The

hypothetical  series  drawn  up  at  the  beginning  of  this  Chapter

expresses, therefore, the actual tendency of capitalist production.

    This mode of production produces a progressive relative decrease

of  the  variable  capital  as  compared  to  the  constant  capital,  and

consequently  a  continuously  rising  organic  composition  of  the  total

capital. The immediate result of this is that the rate of surplus value, at

the same, or even a rising, degree of labor exploitation, is represented

by a continually falling general rate of profit. (We shall see later why

this fall does not manifest itself in an absolute form, but rather as a

tendency toward a progressive fall.) The progressive tendency of the

general rate of profit to fall is, therefore, just an expression peculiar to

the capitalist mode of production of the progressive development ofthe social productivity of labor. This does not mean to say that the rate

of  profit  may  not  fall  temporarily  for  other  reasons.  But  proceeding

from  the  nature  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  it  is  thereby

proved logical necessity that in its development the general average

rate of surplus value must express itself in a falling general rate of

profit. Since the mass of the employed living labor is continually on the

decline as compared to the mass of materialized labor set in motion

by it, i.e., to the productively consumed means of production, it follows

that the portion of living labor, unpaid and congealed in surplus value,

must also be continually on the decrease compared to the amount of

value represented by the invested total capital. Since the ratio of the

mass of surplus value to the value of the invested total capital forms

the rate of profit, this rate must constantly fall.

    Simple as this law appears from the foregoing statements, all of

political economy has so far had little success in discovering it, as we

shall see in a later part. The economists perceived the phenomenon

and cudgeled their brains in tortuous attempts to interpret it. Since this

law is of great importance to capitalist production, it may be said to be

a mystery whose solution has been the goal of all political economy

since Adam Smith, the difference between the various schools since

Adam Smith having been in the divergent approaches to a solution.

When we consider, on the other hand, that up to the present political

economy has been running in circles round the distinction between

constant and variable capital, but has never known how to define it

accurately; that it has never separated surplus value from profit, and

never  even  considered  profit  in  its  pure  form  as  distinct  from  its

different,  independent  components,  such  as  industrial  profit,

commercial  profit,  interest,  and  ground  rent;  that  it  has  never

thoroughly  analyzed  the  differences  in  the  organic  composition  of

capital,  and,  for  this  reason,  has  never  thought  of  analyzing  the

formation of the general rate of profit — if we consider all this, the

failure to solve this riddle is no longer surprising.

    We intentionally present this law before going on to the division of

profit into different independent categories. The fact that this analysis

is  made  independently  of  the  division  of  profit  into  different  parts,

which fall to the share of different categories of people, shows from

the outset that this law is, in its entirety, independent of this division,and  just  as  independent  of  the  mutual  relations  of  the  resultant

categories of profit. The profit to which we are here referring is but

another name for surplus value itself, which is presented only in its

relation to total capital rather than to variable capital, from which it

arises. The drop in the rate of profit, therefore, expresses the falling

relation  of  surplus  value  to  advanced  total  capital,  and  is  for  this

reason independent of any division whatsoever of this surplus value

among the various categories.

    We have seen that at a certain stage of capitalist development,

where the organic composition of capital c : v was 50 : 100, a rate of

surplus value of 100% was expressed in a rate of profit of 66%%, and

that at a higher stage, where c : v was 400 : 100, the same rate of

surplus value was expressed in a rate of profit of only 20%. What is

true of different successive stages of development in one country, is

also  true  of  different  coexisting  stages  of  development  in  different

countries. In an undeveloped country, in which the former composition

of capital is the average, the general rate of profit would = 66%%,

while in a country with the latter composition and a much higher stage

of development it would = 20% [...]

    Let  a  capital  of  100  consist  of  80c  +  20v,  and  the  latter  =  20

laborers. Let the rate of surplus value be 100%, i.e., the laborers work

half the day for themselves and the other half for the capitalist. Now let

the capital of 100 in a less developed country = 20c + 80v, and let the

latter  =  80  laborers.  But  these  laborers  require  2/3  of  the  day  for

themselves, and work only 1/3 for the capitalist. Everything else being

equal, the laborers in the first case produce a value of 40, and in the

second of 120. The first capital produces 80c + 20v + 20s = 120; rate

of profit = 20%. The second capital, 20c + 80v + 40s = 140; rate of

profit 40%. In the second case the rate of profit is, therefore, double

the first, although the rate of surplus value in the first = 100%, which is

double that of the second, where it is only 50%. But then, a capital of

the same magnitude appropriates the surplus labor of only 20 laborers

in the first case, and of 80 laborers in the second case.

    The  law  of  the  progressive  falling  of  the  rate  of  profit,  or  the

relative decline of appropriated surplus labor compared to the mass of

materialized labor set in motion by living labor, does not rule out in any

way that the absolute mass of exploited labor set in motion by thesocial  capital,  and  consequently  the  absolute  mass  of  the  surplus

labor it appropriates, may grow; nor, that the capitals controlled by

individual  capitalists  may  dispose  of  a  growing  mass  of  labor  and,

hence, of surplus labor, the latter even though the number of laborers

they employ does not increase.

    Take a certain working population of, say, two million. Assume,

furthermore, that the length and intensity of the average working day,

and the level of wages, and thereby the proportion between necessary

and surplus labor, are given. In that case the aggregate labor of these

two million, and their surplus labor expressed in surplus value, always

produces the same magnitude of value. But with the growth of the

mass of the constant (fixed and circulating) capital set in motion by

this labor, this produced quantity of value declines in relation to the

value of this capital, which value grows with its mass, even if not in

quite  the  same  proportion.  This  ratio,  and  consequently  the  rate  of

profit, shrinks in spite of the fact that the mass of commanded living

labor is the same as before, and the same amount of surplus labor is

sucked  out  of  it  by  the  capital.  It  changes  because  the  mass  of

materialized  labor  set  in  motion  by  living  labor  increases,  and  not

because the mass of living labor has shrunk. It is a relative decrease,

not an absolute one, and has, in fact, nothing to do with the absolute

magnitude of the labor and surplus labor set in motion. The drop in the

rate of profit is not due to an absolute, but only to a relative decrease

of the variable part of the total capital, i.e., to its decrease in relation to

the constant part.

    What applies to any given mass of labor and surplus labor, also

applies to a growing number of laborers, and, thus, under the above

assumption, to any growing mass of commanded labor in general, and

to  its  unpaid  part,  the  surplus  labor,  in  particular.  If  the  working

population  increases  from  two  million  to  three,  and  if  the  variable

capital invested in wages also rises to three million from its former two

million,  while  the  constant  capital  rises  from  four  million  to  fifteen

million, then, under the above assumption of a constant working day

and a constant rate of surplus value, the mass of surplus labor, and of

surplus value, rises by one-half, i.e., 50%, from two million to three.

Nevertheless, in spite of this growth of the absolute mass of surplus

labor, and hence of surplus value, by 50%, the ratio of variable toconstant capital would fall from 2: 4 to 3: 15, and the ratio of surplus

value to total capital would be (in millions)

    I. 4c + 2v + 2s; C = 6, p’ = 33%.
                                          1/3

    II. 15c + 3v + 3s; C = 18, p’ = 16%.
                                              2/3

    While the mass of surplus value has increased by one-half, the

rate of profit has fallen by one-half. However, the profit is only the

surplus value calculated in relation to the total social capital, and the

mass of profit, its absolute magnitude, is socially equal to the absolute

magnitude of the surplus value. The absolute magnitude of the profit,

its total amount, would, therefore, have grown by 50%, in spite of its

enormous relative decrease compared to the advanced total capital,

or in spite of the enormous decrease in the general rate of profit. The

number of laborers employed by capital, hence the absolute mass of

the  labor  set  in  motion  by  it,  and  therefore  the  absolute  mass  of

surplus labor absorbed by it, the mass of the surplus value produced

by it, and therefore the absolute mass of the profit produced by it, can,

consequently,  increase,  and  increase  progressively,  in  spite  of  the

progressive drop in the rate of profit. And this not only can be so.

Aside  from  temporary  fluctuations  it  must  be  so,  on  the  basis  of

capitalist production [...]

    [The] same laws of production and accumulation increase also the

value of the constant capital in a mounting progression more rapidly

than that of the variable part of capital, invested as it is in living labor.

Hence,  the  same  laws  produce  for  the  social  capital  a  growing

absolute  mass  of  profit,  and  a  falling  rate  of  profit  [...]  The

development  of  capitalist  production  and  accumulation  lifts  labor

processes to an increasingly enlarged scale and thus imparts to them

ever greater dimensions, and involves accordingly larger investments

of capital for each individual establishment. A mounting concentration

of capitals (accompanied, though on a smaller scale, by an increase in

the  number  of  capitalists)  is,  therefore,  one  of  its  material

requirements  as  well  as  one  of  its  results.  Hand  in  hand  with  it,

mutually interacting, there occurs a progressive expropriation of the

more  or  less  direct  producers.  It  is,  then,  natural  for  the  individual

capitalists  to  command  increasingly  large  armies  of  laborers  (no

matter how much the variable capital may decrease in relation to the

constant), and natural, too, that the mass of surplus value, and henceprofit, appropriated by them, should grow simultaneously with, and in

spite of, the fall in the rate of profit [...]

    Now,  what  must  be  the  form  of  this  double-edged  law  of  a

decrease  in  the  rate  of  profit  and  a  simultaneous  increase  in  the

absolute mass of profit arising from the same causes? [...]

    Let us take an aliquot part of capital upon which we calculate the

rate of profit, e.g., 100. These 100 represent the average composition

of the total capital, say, 80c + 20v. We have seen in the second part of

this book that the average rate of profit in the various branches of

production  is  determined  not  by  the  particular  composition  of  each

individual  capital,  but  by  the  average  social  composition.  As  the

variable  capital  decreases  relative  to  the  constant,  hence  the  total

capital of 100, the rate of profit, or the relative magnitude of surplus

value,  i.e.,  its  ratio  to  the  advanced  total  capital  of  100,  falls  even

though the intensity of exploitation were to remain the same, or even

to increase. But it is not this relative magnitude alone which falls. The

magnitude of the surplus value or profit absorbed by the total capital of

100 also falls absolutely. At a rate of surplus value of 100%, a capital

of 60c + 40v produces a mass of surplus value, and hence of profit,

amounting to 40; a capital of 80c + 20v a mass of profit of 30; and for

a capital of 80c + 20v the profit falls to 20. This falling applies to the

mass of surplus value, and hence of profit, and is due to the fact that

the total capital of 100 employs less living labor, and, the intensity of

labor  exploitation  remaining  the  same,  sets  in  motion  less  surplus

labor, and therefore produces less surplus value. Taking any aliquot

part of the social capital, i.e., a capital of average composition, as a

standard by which to measure surplus value — and this is done in all

profit  calculations  —  a  relative  fall  of  surplus  value  is  generally

identical with its absolute fall. In the cases given above, the rate of

profit sinks from 40% to 30% and to 20%, because, in fact, the mass

of surplus value, and hence of profit, produced by the same capital

falls absolutely from 40 to 30 and to 20. Since the magnitude of the

value of the capital, by which the surplus value is measured, is given

as 100, a fall in the proportion of surplus value to this given magnitude

can  be  only  another  expression  for  the  decrease  of  the  absolute

magnitude of surplus value and profit. This is, indeed, a tautology. But,as shown, the fact that this decrease occurs at all, arises from the

nature of the development of the capitalist process of production.

    On the other hand, however, the same causes which bring about

an absolute decrease of surplus value, and hence profit, on a given

capital, and consequently of the rate of profit calculated in per cent,

produce an increase in the absolute mass of surplus value, and hence

of profit, appropriated by the social capital (i.e., by all capitalists taken

as a whole). How does this occur, what is the only way in which this

can  occur,  or  what  are  the  conditions  obtaining  in  this  seeming

contradiction? [...]

    In our former illustration, when the percentage of composition was

60c + 40v, the corresponding surplus value, or profit, was 40, and

hence the rate of profit 40%. Suppose, the total capital in this stage of

composition was one million. Then the total surplus value, and hence

the total profit, amounted to 400,000. Now, if the composition later =

80c + 20v, while the degree of labor exploitation remained the same,

then  the  surplus  value  or  profit  for  each  100  =  20.  But  since  the

absolute mass of surplus value or profit increases, as demonstrated,

in spite of the decreasing rate of profit or the decreasing production of

surplus value by every 100 of capital — increases, say, from 400,000

to  440,000,  then  this  occurs  solely  because  the  total  capital  which

formed at the time of this new composition has risen to 2,200,000. The

mass of the total capital set in motion has risen to 220%, while the

rate of profit has fallen by 50%. Had the total capital no more than

doubled, it would have to produce as much surplus value and profit to

obtain a rate of profit of 20% as the old capital of 1,000,000 produced

at 40%. Had it grown to less than double, it would have produced less

surplus value, or profit, than the old capital of 1,000,000, which, in its

former  composition,  would  have  had  to  grow  from  1,000,000  to  no

more  than  1,100,000  to  raise  its  surplus  value  from  400,000  to

440,000.

    We again meet here the previously defined law that the relative

decrease of the variable capital, hence the development of the social

productiveness of labor, involves an increasingly large mass of total

capital to set in motion the same quantity of labor power and squeeze

out the same quantity of surplus labor. Consequently, the possibility of

a relative surplus of laboring people develops proportionately to theadvances  made  by  capitalist  production  not  because  the

productiveness of social labor decreases, but because it increases. It

does  not  therefore  arise  out  of  an  absolute  disproportion  between

labor and the means of subsistence, or the means for the production

of these means of subsistence, but out of a disproportion occasioned

by  capitalist  exploitation  of  labor,  a  disproportion  between  the

progressive growth of capital and its relatively shrinking need for an

increasing population.

    Should the rate of profit fall by 50%, it would shrink one-half? If

the mass of profit is to remain the same, the capital must be doubled.

For the mass of profit made at a declining rate of profit to remain the

same, the multiplier indicating the growth of the total capital must be

equal to the divisor indicating the fall of the rate of profit. If the rate of

profit falls from 40 to 20, the total capital must rise inversely at the rate

of 20: 40 to obtain the same result. If the rate of profit falls from 40 to

8, the capital would have to increase at the rate of 8: 40, or five-fold. A

capital  of  1,000,000  at  40%  produces  400,000,  and  a  capital  of

5,000,000 at 8% likewise produces 400,000. This applies if we want

the result to remain the same. But if the result is to be higher, then the

capital must grow at a greater rate than the rate of profit falls. In other

words, for the variable portion of the total capital not to remain the

same in absolute terms, but to increase absolutely in spite of its falling

in percentage of the total capital, the total capital must grow at a faster

rate than the percentage of the variable capital falls. It must grow so

considerably that in its new composition it should require more than

the  old  portion  of  variable  capital  to  purchase  labor  power.  If  the

variable portion of a capital = 100 should fall from 40 to 20, the total

capital must rise higher than 200 to be able to employ a larger variable

capital than 40.

    Even  if  the  exploited  mass  of  the  working  population  were  to

remain constant, and only the length and intensity of the working day

were  to  increase,  the  mass  of  the  invested  capital  would  have  to

increase,  since  it  would  have  to  be  greater  in  order  to  employ  the

same mass of labor under the old conditions of exploitation after the

composition of capital changes.

    Thus, the same development of the social productiveness of labor

expresses itself with the progress of capitalist production on the onehand in a tendency of the rate of profit to fall progressively and, on the

other,  in  a  progressive  growth  of  the  absolute  mass  of  the

appropriated surplus value, or profit; so that on the whole a relative

decrease of variable capital and profit is accompanied by an absolute

increase of both. This two-fold effect, as we have seen, can express

itself only in a growth of the total capital at a pace more rapid than that

at which the rate of profit falls. For an absolutely increased variable

capital to be employed in a capital of higher composition, or one in

which  the  constant  capital  has  increased  relatively  more,  the  total

capital must not only grow proportionately to its higher composition,

but still more rapidly. It follows, then, that as the capitalist mode of

production develops, an ever larger quantity of capital is required to

employ  the  same,  let  alone  an  increased,  amount  of  labor  power.

Thus,  on  a  capitalist  foundation,  the  increasing  productiveness  of

labor necessarily and permanently creates a seeming over-population

of laboring people. If the variable capital forms just 1/6 of the total

capital instead of the former 1/2, the total capital must be trebled to

employ the same amount of labor power. And if twice as much labor

power is to be employed, the total capital must increase six-fold [...]

    To say that the mass of profit is determined by two factors — first,

the rate of profit, and, secondly, the mass of capital invested at this

rate, is mere tautology. It is therefore but a corollary of this tautology

to say that there is a possibility for the mass of profit to grow even

though the rate of profit may fall at the same time. It does not help us

one step farther, since it is just as possible for the capital to increase

without the mass of profit growing, and for it to increase even while the

mass of profit falls. For 100 at 25% yields 25, and 400 at 5% yields

only  20.  But  if  the  same  causes  which  make  the  rate  of  profit  fall,

entail the accumulation, i.e., the formation, of additional capital, and if

each  additional  capital  employs  additional  labor  and  produces

additional surplus value; if, on the other hand, the mere fall in the rate

of  profit  implies  that  the  constant  capital,  and  with  it  the  total  old

capital, have increased, then this process ceases to be mysterious [...]

    We  have  shown  how  the  same  causes  that  bring  about  a

tendency  for  the  general  rate  of  profit  to  fall  necessitate  an

accelerated accumulation of capital and, consequently, an increase in

the absolute magnitude, or total mass, of the surplus labor (surplusvalue, profit) appropriated by it. Just as everything appears reversed

in  competition,  and  thus  in  the  consciousness  of  the  agents  of

competition,  so  also  this  law,  this  inner  and  necessary  connection

between  two  seeming  contradictions.  It  is  evident  that  within  the

proportions indicated above a capitalist disposing of a large capital will

receive  a  larger  mass  of  profit  than  a  small  capitalist  making

seemingly  high  profits.  Even  a  cursory  examination  of  competition

shows,  furthermore,  that  under  certain  circumstances,  when  the

greater capitalist wishes to make room for himself on the market, and

to  crowd  out  the  smaller  ones,  as  happens  in  times  of  crises,  he

makes practical use of this, i.e., he deliberately lowers his rate of profit

in order to drive the smaller ones to the wall [...]

    The phenomenon, springing from the nature of the capitalist mode

of production, that increasing productivity of labor implies a drop in the

price of the individual commodity, or of a certain mass of commodities,

an increase in the number of commodities, a reduction in the mass of

profit  on  the  individual  commodity  and  in  the  rate  of  profit  on  the

aggregate of commodities, and an increase in the mass of profit on

the total quantity of commodities — this phenomenon appears on the

surface  only  in  a  reduction  of  the  mass  of  profit  on  the  individual

commodity, a fall in its price, an increase in the mass of profit on the

augmented total number of commodities produced by the total social

capital or an individual capitalist [...]

    The fall in commodity prices and the rise in the mass of profit on

the augmented mass of these cheapened commodities is, in fact, but

another expression for the law of the falling rate of profit attended by a

simultaneously increasing mass of profit.

    The analysis of how far a falling rate of profit may coincide with

rising prices no more belongs here than that of the point previously

discussed in Book I [...], concerning relative surplus value. A capitalist

working with improved but not as yet generally adopted methods of

production sells below the market price, but above his individual price

of  production;  his  rate  of  profit  rises  until  competition  levels  it  out.

During this equalization period the second requisite, expansion of the

invested capital, makes its appearance. According to the degree of

this expansion the capitalist will be able to employ a part of his former

laborers, actually perhaps all of them, or even more, under the newconditions,  and  hence  to  produce  the  same,  or  a  greater,  mass  of

profit.                      Chapter 14: Counteracting Influences



    If we consider the enormous development of the productive forces

of  social  labor  in  the  last  30  years  alone  as  compared  with  all

preceding periods; if we consider, in particular, the enormous mass of

fixed  capital,  aside  from  the  actual  machinery,  which  goes  into  the

process of social production as a whole, then the difficulty which has

hitherto troubled the economist, namely to explain the falling rate of

profit, gives place to its opposite, namely to explain why this fall is not

greater and more rapid. There must be some counteracting influences

at  work,  which  cross  and  annul  the  effect  of  the  general  law,  and

which give it merely the characteristic of a tendency, for which reason

we have referred to the fall of the general rate of profit as a tendency

to fall.

    The following are the most general counterbalancing forces:



    I. Increasing Intensity of Exploitation


    The degree of exploitation of labor, the appropriation of surplus

labor and surplus value, is raised notably by lengthening the working

day  and  intensifying  labor.  These  two  points  have  been

comprehensively treated in Book I as incidental to the production of

absolute  and  relative  surplus  value.  There  are  many  ways  of

intensifying labor which imply an increase of constant, as compared to

variable,  capital,  and  hence  a  fall  in  the  rate  of  profit,  such  as

compelling a laborer to operate a larger number of machines. In such

cases — and in most procedures serving the production of relative

surplus values — the same causes which increase the rate of surplus

value, may also, from the standpoint of given quantities of invested

total capital, involve a fall in the mass of surplus value. But there are

other  aspects  of  intensification,  such  as  the  greater  velocities  of

machinery, which consume rawer material in the same time, but, sofar as the fixed capital is concerned, wear out the machinery so much

faster, and yet do not in any way affect the relation of its value to the

price of the labor which sets it in motion. But notably, it is prolongation

of the working day, this invention of modern industry, which increases

the mass of appropriated surplus labor without essentially altering the

proportion of the employed labor power to the constant capital set in

motion by it, and which rather tends to reduce this capital relatively.

    Moreover,  it  has  already  been  demonstrated  —  and  this

constitutes the real secret of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall —

that the manipulations to produce relative surplus value amount, on

the whole, to transforming as much as possible of a certain quantity of

labor into surplus value, on the one hand, and employing as little labor

as possible in proportion to the invested capital, on the other, so that

the same reasons which permit raising the intensity of exploitation rule

out  exploiting  the  same  quantity  of  labor  as  before  by  the  same

capital. These are the counteracting tendencies, which, while effecting

a rise in the rate of surplus value, also tend to decrease the mass of

surplus  value,  and  hence  the  rate  of  profit  produced  by  a  certain

capital.  Mention  should  also  be  made  here  of  the  widespread

introduction of female and child labor, in so far as the whole family

must now perform more surplus labor for capital than before, even

when the total amount of their wages increases, which is by no means

always  the  case.  —  Everything  that  promotes  the  production  of

relative  surplus  value  by  mere  improvement  in  methods,  as  in

agriculture, without altering the magnitude of the invested capital, has

the same effect [...]

    Before leaving this point, it is to be emphasized once more that

with a capital of a given magnitude the rate of surplus value may rise,

while  its  mass  is  decreasing,  and  vice  versa.  The  mass  of  surplus

value  is  equal  to  the  rate  multiplied  by  the  number  of  laborers;

however,  the  rate  is  never  calculated  on  the  total,  but  only  on  the

variable  capital,  actually  only  for  every  working  day.  On  the  other

hand, with a given magnitude of capital value, the rate of profit can

neither rise nor fall without the mass of surplus value also rising or

falling.    II. Depression of Wages Below the Value of Labor Power


    This  is  mentioned  here  only  empirically,  since,  like  many  other

things  which  might  be  enumerated,  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  the

general analysis of capital, but belongs in an analysis of competition,

which is not presented in this work. However, it is one of the most

important factors checking the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.



    III. Cheapening of Elements of Constant Capital


    Everything said in Part I of this book about factors which raise the

rate  of  profit  while  the  rate  of  surplus  value  remains  the  same,  or

regardless of the rate of surplus value, belongs here. Hence also, with

respect to the total capital, that the value of the constant capital does

not  increase  in  the  same  proportion  as  its  material  volume.  For

instance,  the  quantity  of  cotton  worked  up  by  a  single  European

spinner in a modern factory has grown tremendously compared to the

quantity formerly worked up by a European spinner with a spinning-

wheel. Yet the value of the worked-up cotton has not grown in the

same  proportion  as  its  mass.  The  same  applies  to  machinery  and

other fixed capital. In short, the same development which increases

the mass of the constant capital in relation to the variable reduces the

value of its elements as a result of the increased productivity of labor,

and  therefore  prevents  the  value  of  constant  capital,  although  it

continually increases, from increasing at the same rate as its material

volume, i.e., the material volume of the means of production set in

motion  by  the  same  amount  of  labor  power.  In  isolated  cases  the

mass of the elements of constant capital may even increase, while its

value remains the same, or falls.

    The foregoing is bound up with the depreciation of existing capital

(that is, of its material elements), which occurs with the development

of industry. This is another continually operating factor which checks

the  fall  of  the  rate  of  profit,  although  it  may  under  certain

circumstances encroach on the mass of profit by reducing the mass of

the capital yielding a profit. This again shows that the same influenceswhich tend to make the rate of profit fall, also moderate the effects of

this tendency.



    IV. Relative Over-Population


    Its  propagation  is  inseparable  from,  and  hastened  by,  the

development of the productivity of labor as expressed by a fall in the

rate  of  profit.  The  relative  over-population  becomes  so  much  more

apparent in a country, the more the capitalist mode of production is

developed in it. This, again, is the reason why, on the one hand, the

more or less imperfect subordination of labor to capital continues in

many branches of production, and continues longer than seems at first

glance compatible with the general stage of development. This is due

to the cheapness and abundance of disposable or unemployed wage

laborers,  and  to  the  greater  resistance,  which  some  branches  of

production,  by  their  very  nature,  render  to  the  transformation  of

manual work into machine production. On the other hand, new lines of

production are opened up, especially for the production of luxuries,

and it is these that take as their basis this relative over-population,

often set free in other lines of production through the increase of their

constant capital. These new lines start out predominantly with living

labor, and by degrees pass through the same evolution as the other

lines  of  production.  In  either  case  the  variable  capital  makes  up  a

considerable  portion  of  the  total  capital  and  wages  are  below  the

average, so that both the rate and mass of surplus value in these lines

of production are unusually high. Since the general rate of profit is

formed  by  levelling  the  rates  of  profit  in  the  individual  branches  of

production, however, the same factor which brings about the tendency

in the rate of profit to fall, again produces a counterbalance to this

tendency and more or less paralyses its effects.



    V. Foreign Trade


    Since  foreign  trade  partly  cheapens  the  elements  of  constant

capital, and partly the necessities of life for which the variable capitalis exchanged, it tends to raise the rate of profit by increasing the rate

of surplus value and lowering the value of constant capital. It generally

acts  in  this  direction  by  permitting  an  expansion  of  the  scale  of

production. It thereby hastens the process of accumulation, on the one

hand,  but  causes  the  variable  capital  to  shrink  in  relation  to  the

constant capital, on the other, and thus hastens a fall in the rate of

profit. In the same way, the expansion of foreign trade, although the

basis of the capitalist mode of production in its infancy, has become its

own product, however, with the further progress of the capitalist mode

of production, through the innate necessity of this mode of production,

its need for an ever-expanding market. Here we see once more the

dual nature of this effect [...]

    We have thus seen in a general way that the same influences

which produce a tendency in the general rate of profit to fall, also call

forth counter-effects, which hamper, retard, and partly paralyze this

fall.  The  latter  do  not  do  away  with  the  law,  but  impair  its  effect.

Otherwise, it would not be the fall of the general rate of profit, but

rather its relative slowness, that would be incomprehensible. Thus, the

law  acts  only  as  a  tendency.  And  it  is  only  under  certain

circumstances  and  only  after  long  periods  that  its  effects  become

strikingly pronounced [...]      Chapter 15: Exposition of The Internal Contradictions of the

                                          Law



    I. General


    We have seen in the first part of this book that the rate of profit

expresses the rate of surplus value always lower than it actually is.

We  have  just  seen  that  even  a  rising  rate  of  surplus  value  has  a

tendency to express itself in a falling rate of profit. The rate of profit

would equal the rate of surplus value only if c = 0, i.e., if the total

capital were paid out in wages. A falling rate of profit does not express

a falling rate of surplus value, unless the proportion of the value of the

constant capital to the quantity of labor power which sets it in motion

remains unchanged or the amount of labor power increases in relation

to the value of the constant capital [...]

    A  fall  in  the  rate  of  profit  and  accelerated  accumulation  are

different expressions of the same process only in so far as both reflect

the development of productiveness. Accumulation, in turn, hastens the

fall of the rate of profit, inasmuch as it implies concentration of labor

on a large scale, and thus a higher composition of capital. On the

other hand, a fall in the rate of profit again hastens the concentration

of  capital  and  its  centralization  through  expropriation  of  minor

capitalists, the few direct producers who still have anything left to be

expropriated.  This  accelerates  accumulation  with  regard  to  mass,

although the rate of accumulation falls with the rate of profit.

    On the other hand, the rate of self-expansion of the total capital,

or the rate of profit, being the goad of capitalist production (just as

self-expansion  of  capital  is  its  only  purpose),  its  fall  checks  the

formation of new independent capitals and thus appears as a threat to

the  development  of  the  capitalist  production  process.  It  breeds

overproduction,  speculation,  crises,  and  surplus  capital  alongside

surplus population. Those economists, therefore, who, like Ricardo,

regard the capitalist mode of production as absolute, feel at this pointthat it creates a barrier itself, and for this reason attribute the barrier to

Nature (in the theory of rent), not to production. But the main thing

about their horror of the falling rate of profit is the feeling that capitalist

production meets in the development of its productive forces a barrier

which has nothing to do with the production of wealth as such; and

this  peculiar  barrier  testifies  to  the  limitations  and  to  the  merely

historical,  transitory  character  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production;

testifies that for the production of wealth, it is not an absolute mode,

moreover,  that  at  a  certain  stage  it  rather  conflicts  with  its  further

development.

    True,  Ricardo  and  his  school  considered  only  industrial  profit,

which  includes  interest.  But  the  rate  of  ground  rent  likewise  has  a

tendency to fall, although its absolute mass increases, and may also

increase  proportionately  more  than  industrial  profit.  (See  Ed.  West,

who developed the law of ground rent before Ricardo). If we consider

the  total  social  capital  C,  and  use  p1  for  the  industrial  profit  that

remains after deducting interest and ground rent, i for interest, and r

for ground rent, then s/C = p/C = (p1 + i + r)/C = p1/C + i/C + r/C. We

have seen that while s, the total amount of surplus value, is continually

increasing  in  the  course  of  capitalist  development,  s/C  is  just  as

steadily  declining,  because  C  grows  still  more  rapidly  than  s.

Therefore,  it  is  by  no  means  a  contradiction  for  p1,  i,  and  r  to  be

steadily increasing, each individually, while s/C = p/C, as well as p1/C,

i/C, and r/C, should each by itself be steadily shrinking, or that p1

should increase in relation to i, or r in relation to p1 or to p1 and i. With

a rising total surplus value or profit s = p, and a simultaneously falling

rate of profit s/C = p/C, the proportions of the parts p1, i, and r, which

make up s = p, may change at will within the limits set by the total

amount of s without thereby affecting the magnitude of s or s/C.

    The mutual variation of p1, i, and r is merely a varying distribution

of s among different classes. Consequently, p1/C, i/C, or r/C, the rate

of  individual  industrial  profit,  the  rate  of  interest,  and  the  ratio  of

ground rent to the total capital, may rise in relation to one another,

while s/C, the general rate of profit, falls. The only condition is that the

sum  of  all  three  =  s/C.  If  the  rate  of  profit  falls  from  50%  to  25%,

because  the  composition  of  a  certain  capital  with,  say,  a  rate  of

surplus value = 100% has changed from 50c + 50v to 75c + 25v, thena capital of 1,000 will yield a profit of 500 in the first case, and in the

second a capital of 4,000 will yield a profit of 1,000. We see that s or p

have doubled, while p' has fallen by one-half. And if that 50% was

formerly divided into 20 profit, 10 interest, and 20 rent, then p1/C =

20%, i/C = 10%, and r/C = 20%. If the proportions had remained the

same after the change from 50% to 25%, then p1/C = 10%, i/C = 5%,

and r/C = 10%. If, however, p1/C should fall to 8% and i/C to 4%, then

r/C would rise to 13%. The relative magnitude of r would have risen as

against p1 and i, while p would have remained the same. Under both

assumptions, the sum of p1, i, and r would have increased, because

produced  by  a  capital  four  times  as  large.  Furthermore,  Ricardo's

assumption that originally industrial profit (plus interest) contains the

entire surplus value is historically and logically false. It is rather the

progress  of  capitalist  production  which  1)  gives  the  whole  profit

directly  to  the  industrial  and  commercial  capitalists  for  further

distribution, and 2) reduces rent to the excess over the profit. On this

capitalist basis, again, the rent grows, being a portion of profit (i.e., of

the surplus value viewed as the product of the total capital), but not

that specific portion of the product, which the capitalist pockets [...]

    The creation of this surplus value makes up the direct process of

production,  which,  as  we  have  said,  has  no  other  limits  but  those

mentioned above. As soon as all the surplus labor it was possible to

squeeze out has been embodied in commodities, surplus value has

been produced. But this production of surplus value completes but the

first act of the capitalist process of production — the direct production

process. Capital has absorbed so and so much unpaid labor. With the

development of the process, which expresses itself in a drop in the

rate  of  profit,  the  mass  of  surplus  value  thus  produced  swells  to

immense dimensions. Now comes the second act of the process. The

entire  mass  of  commodities,  i.e.,  the  total  product,  including  the

portion  which  replaces  the  constant  and  variable  capital,  and  that

representing surplus value, must be sold. If this is not done, or done

only  in  part,  or  only  at  prices  below  the  prices  of  production,  the

laborer has been indeed exploited, but his exploitation is not realized

as such for the capitalist, and this can be bound up with a total or

partial failure to realize the surplus value pressed out of him, indeed

even with the partial or total loss of the capital. The conditions of directexploitation, and those of realizing it, are not identical. They diverge

not only in place and time, but also logically. The first are only limited

by  the  productive  power  of  society,  the  latter  by  the  proportional

relation  of  the  various  branches  of  production  and  the  consumer

power of society. But this last-named is not determined either by the

absolute productive power, or by the absolute consumer power, but by

the consumer power based on antagonistic conditions of distribution,

which reduce the consumption of the bulk of society to a minimum

varying within more or less narrow limits. It is furthermore restricted by

the tendency to accumulate, the drive to expand capital and produce

surplus value on an extended scale.

    This  is  law  for  capitalist  production,  imposed  by  incessant

revolutions  in  the  methods  of  production  themselves,  by  the

depreciation  of  existing  capital  always  bound  up  with  them,  by  the

general competitive struggle and the need to improve production and

expand its scale merely as a means of self-preservation and under

penalty of ruin. The market must, therefore, be continually extended,

so that its interrelations and the conditions regulating them assume

more and more the form of a natural law working independently of the

producer,  and  become  ever  more  uncontrollable.  This  internal

contradiction seeks to resolve itself through expansion of the outlying

field of production. But the more productiveness develops, the more it

finds itself at variance with the narrow basis on which the conditions of

consumption rest. It is no contradiction at all on this self-contradictory

basis that there should be an excess of capital simultaneously with a

growing surplus of population. For while a combination of these two

would, indeed, increase the mass of produced surplus value, it would

at the same time intensify the contradiction between the conditions

under which this surplus value is produced and those under which it is

realized.

    If a certain rate of profit is given, the mass of profit will always

depend on the magnitude of the advanced capital. The accumulation,

however,  is  then  determined  by  that  portion  of  this  mass  which  is

reconverted into capital. As for this portion, being equal to the profit

minus  the  revenue  consumed  by  the  capitalists,  it  will  depend  not

merely on the value of this mass, but also on the cheapness of the

commodities which the capitalist can buy with it, commodities whichpass  partly  into  his  consumption,  his  revenue,  and  partly  into  his

constant capital. (Wages are here assumed to be given.)

    The mass of capital set in motion by the laborer, whose value he

preserves by his labor and reproduces in his product, is quite different

from the value which he adds to it. If the mass of the capital = 1,000

and  the  added  labor  =  100,  the  reproduced  capital  =  1,100.  If  the

mass = 100 and the added labor = 20, the reproduced capital = 120.

In the first case the rate of profit = 10%, in the second = 20%. And yet

more can be accumulated out of 100 than out of 20. And thus the river

of capital rolls on (aside from its depreciation through increase of the

productiveness), or its accumulation does, not in proportion to the rate

of profit, but in proportion to the impetus it already possesses [...]

    [The] mass of profit increases in spite of its slower rate with the

growth of the invested capital. However, this requires a simultaneous

concentration  of  capital,  since  the  conditions  of  production  then

demand employment of capital on a larger scale. It also requires its

centralization, i.e., the swallowing up of the small capitalists by the big

and  their  deprivation  of  capital.  It  is  again  but  an  instance  of

separating  —  raised  to  the  second  power  —  the  conditions  of

production  from  the  producers  to  whose  number  these  small

capitalists still belong, since their own labor continues to play a role in

their  case.  The  labor  of  a  capitalist  stands  altogether  in  inverse

proportion to the size of his capital, i.e., to the degree in which he is a

capitalist. It is this same severance of the conditions of production, on

the  one  hand,  from  the  producers,  on  the  other,  that  forms  the

conception  of  capital.  It  begins  with  primitive  accumulation  [...],

appears  as  a  permanent  process  in  the  accumulation  and

concentration of capital, and expresses itself finally as centralization of

existing capitals in a few hands and a deprivation of many of their

capital (to which expropriation is now changed). This process would

soon bring about the collapse of capitalist production if it were not for

counteracting  tendencies,  which  have  a  continuous  decentralizing

effect alongside the centripetal one.



    II. Conflict Between Expansion of Production and Production

of Surplus Value    [...] Alongside the stimulants of an actual increase of the laboring

population, which spring from the increase of the portion of the total

social product serving as capital, there are agencies which create a

merely relative over-population.

    Alongside the fall in the rate of profit mass of capitals grows, and

hand in hand with this there occurs a depreciation of existing capitals

which  checks  the  fall  and  gives  an  accelerating  motion  to  the

accumulation of capital values.

    Alongside the development of productivity there develops a higher

composition  of  capital,  i.e.,  the  relative  decrease  of  the  ratio  of

variable to constant capital.

    These different influences may at one time operate predominantly

side by side in space, and at another succeed each other in time.

From time to time the conflict of antagonistic agencies finds vent in

crises. The crises are always but momentary and forcible solutions of

the existing contradictions. They are violent eruptions which for a time

restore the disturbed equilibrium.

    The contradiction, to put it in a very general way, consists in that

the  capitalist  mode  of  production  involves  a  tendency  towards

absolute development of the productive forces, regardless of the value

and surplus value it contains, and regardless of the social conditions

under  which  capitalist  production  takes  place;  while,  on  the  other

hand,  its  aim  is  to  preserve  the  value  of  the  existing  capital  and

promote its self-expansion to the highest limit (i.e., to promote an ever

more rapid growth of this value). The specific feature about it is that it

uses the existing value of capital as a means of increasing this value

to the utmost. The methods by which it accomplishes this include the

fall  of  the  rate  of  profit,  depreciation  of  existing  capital,  and

development  of  the  productive  forces  of  labor  at  the  expense  of

already created productive forces.

    The periodical depreciation of existing capital — one of the means

immanent in capitalist production to check the fall of the rate of profit

and hasten accumulation of capital value through formation of new

capital — disturbs the given conditions, within which the process of

circulation and reproduction of capital takes place, and is therefore

accompanied  by  sudden  stoppages  and  crises  in  the  production

process.    The  decrease  of  variable  in  relation  to  constant  capital,  which

goes  hand  in  hand  with  the  development  of  the  productive  forces,

stimulates  the  growth  of  the  laboring  population,  while  continually

creating  an  artificial  over-population.  The  accumulation  of  capital  in

terms of value is slowed down by the falling rate of profit, to hasten

still more the accumulation of use values, while this, in its turn, adds

new momentum to accumulation in terms of value.

    Capitalist  production  seeks  continually  to  overcome  these

immanent barriers, but overcomes them only by means which again

place these barriers in its way and on a more formidable scale.

    The real barrier of capitalist production is capital itself. It is that

capital and its self-expansion appear as the starting and the closing

point, the motive and the purpose of production; that production is only

production for capital and not vice versa, the means of production are

not mere means for a constant expansion of the living process of the

society of producers. The limits within which the preservation and self-

expansion  of  the  value  of  capital  resting  on  the  expropriation  and

pauperization of the great mass of producers can alone move — these

limits  come  continually  into  conflict  with  the  methods  of  production

employed by capital for its purposes, which drive towards unlimited

extension  of  production,  towards  production  as  an  end  in  itself,

towards unconditional development of the social productivity of labor.

The means — unconditional development of the productive forces of

society — comes continually into conflict with the limited purpose, the

self-expansion  of  the  existing  capital.  The  capitalist  mode  of

production  is,  for  this  reason,  a  historical  means  of  developing  the

material forces of production and creating an appropriate world market

and is, at the same time, a continual conflict between this its historical

task and its own corresponding relations of social production.



    III. Excess Capital and Excess Population


    [...] There would be absolute overproduction of capital as soon as

additional  capital  for  purposes  of  capitalist  production  =  0.  The

purpose of capitalist production, however, is self-expansion of capital,

i.e.,  appropriation  of  surplus  labor,  production  of  surplus  value,  ofprofit. As soon as capital would, therefore, have grown in such a ratio

to  the  laboring  population  that  neither  the  absolute  working  time

supplied  by  this  population,  nor  the  relative  surplus  working  time,

could be expanded any further (this last would not be feasible at any

rate in the case when the demand for labor were so strong that there

were a tendency for wages to rise); at a point, therefore, when the

increased capital produced just as much, or even less, surplus value

than it did before its increase, there would be absolute overproduction

of capital; i.e., the increased capital C + AC would produce no more,

or even less, profit than capital C before its expansion by AC. In both

cases there would be a steep and sudden fall in the general rate of

profit, but this time due to a change in the composition of capital not

caused by the development of the productive forces, but rather by a

rise in the money value of the variable capital (because of increased

wages) and the corresponding reduction in the proportion of surplus

labor to necessary labor.

    In reality, it would appear that a portion of the capital would lie

completely or partially idle (because it would have to crowd out some

of the active capital before it could expand its own value), and the

other portion would produce values at a lower rate of profit, owing to

the pressure of unemployed or but partly employed capital. It would be

immaterial in this respect if a part of the additional capital were to take

the place of the old capital, and the latter were to take its position in

the  additional  capital.  We  should  still  always  have  the  old  sum  of

capital on one side, and the sum of additional capital on the other. The

fall in the rate of profit would then be accompanied by an absolute

decrease  in  the  mass  of  profit,  since  the  mass  of  employed  labor

power  could  not  be  increased  and  the  rate  of  surplus  value  raised

under the conditions we had assumed, so that the mass of surplus

value could not be increased either. And the reduced mass of profit

would have to be calculated on an increased total capital. But even if it

is assumed that the employed capital continues to self-expand at the

old rate of profit, and the mass of profit hence remains the same, this

mass  would  still  he  calculated  on  an  increased  total  capital,  this

likewise implying a fall in the rate of profit. If a total capital of 1,000

yielded a profit of 100, and after being increased to 1,500 still yielded

100,  then,  in  the  second  case,  1,000  would  yield  only  66%.  Self-expansion of the old capital, in the absolute sense, would have been

reduced.  The  capital  =  1,000  would  yield  no  more  under  the  new

circumstances than formerly a capital = 666%.

    It  is  evident,  however,  that  this  actual  depreciation  of  the  old

capital  could  not  occur  without  a  struggle,  and  that  the  additional

capital  AC  could  not  assume  the  functions  of  capital  without  a

struggle.  The  rate  of  profit  would  not  fall  under  the  effect  of

competition due to overproduction of capital. It would rather be the

reverse;  it  would  be  the  competitive  struggle  which  would  begin

because the fallen rate of profit and overproduction of capital originate

from  the  same  conditions.  The  part  of  AC  in  the  hands  of  old

functioning capitalists would be allowed to remain more or less idle to

prevent a depreciation of their own original capital and not to narrow

its place in the field of production. Or they would employ it, even at a

momentary loss, to shift the need of keeping additional capital idle on

newcomers and on their competitors in general.

    That portion of AC which is in new hands would seek to assume a

place for itself at the expense of the old capital, and would accomplish

this in part by forcing a portion of the old capital to lie idle. It would

compel the old capital to give up its old place and withdraw to join

completely or partially unemployed additional capital.

    A  portion  of  the  old  capital  has  to  lie  unused  under  all

circumstances; it has to give up its characteristic quality as capital, so

far  as  acting  as  such  and  producing  value  is  concerned.  The

competitive struggle would decide what part of it would be particularly

affected. So long as things go well, competition effects an operating

fraternity of the capitalist class, as we have seen in the case of the

equalization of the general rate of profit, so that each shares in the

common loot in proportion to the size of his respective investment. But

as soon as it no longer is a question of sharing profits, but of sharing

losses, everyone tries to reduce his own share to a minimum and to

shove it off upon another. The class, as such, must inevitably lose.

How much the individual capitalist must bear of the loss, i.e., to what

extent he must share in it at all, is decided by strength and cunning,

and  competition  then  becomes  a  fight  among  hostile  brothers.  The

antagonism between each individual capitalist’s interests and those of

the  capitalist  class  as  a  whole,  then  comes  to  the  surface,  just  aspreviously the identity of these interests operated in practice through

competition.

    How  is  this  conflict  settled  and  the  conditions  restored  which

correspond  to  the  "sound"  operation  of  capitalist  production?  The

mode of settlement is already indicated in the very emergence of the

conflict whose settlement is under discussion. It implies the withdrawal

and even the partial destruction of capital amounting to the full value

of  additional  capital  AC,  or  at  least  a  part  of  it.  Although,  as  the

description  of  this  conflict  shows,  the  loss  is  by  no  means  equally

distributed  among  individual  capitals,  its  distribution  being  rather

decided through a competitive struggle in which the loss is distributed

in  very  different  proportions  and  forms,  depending  on  special

advantages or previously captured positions, so that one capital is left

unused, another is destroyed, and a third suffers but a relative loss, or

is just temporarily depreciated, etc.

    But  the  equilibrium  would  be  restored  under  all  circumstances

through the withdrawal or even the destruction of more or less capital.

This would extend partly to the material substance of capital, i.e., a

part of the means of production, of fixed and circulating capital, would

not operate, not act as capital; some of the operating establishments

would then be brought to a standstill. Although, in this respect, time

attacks  and  worsens  all  means  of  production  (except  land),  the

stoppage would in reality cause far greater damage to the means of

production. However, the main effect in this case would be that these

means  of  production  would  cease  to  function  as  such,  that  their

function as means of production would be disturbed for a shorter or

longer period.

    The main damage, and that of the most acute nature, would occur

in  respect  to  capital,  and  in  so  far  as  the  latter  possesses  the

characteristic  of  value  it  would  occur  in  respect  to  the  values  of

capitals. That portion of the value of a capital which exists only in the

form of claims on prospective shares of surplus value, i.e., profit, in

fact in the form of promissory notes on production in various forms, is

immediately depreciated by the reduction of the receipts on which it is

calculated. A part of the gold and silver lies unused, i.e., does not

function  as  capital.  Part  of  the  commodities  on  the  market  can

complete their process of circulation and reproduction only through animmense contraction of their prices, hence through a depreciation of

the  capital  which  they  represent.  The  elements  of  fixed  capital  are

depreciated to a greater or lesser degree in just the same way. It must

be  added  that  definite,  presupposed,  price  relations  govern  the

process of reproduction, so that the latter is halted and thrown into

confusion by a general drop in prices. This confusion and stagnation

paralyses  the  function  of  money  as  a  medium  of  payment,  whose

development is geared to the development of capital and is based on

those presupposed price relations. The chain of payment obligations

due at specific dates is broken in a hundred places. The confusion is

augmented  by  the  attendant  collapse  of  the  credit  system,  which

develops simultaneously with capital, and leads to violent and acute

crises, to sudden and forcible depreciations, to the actual stagnation

and disruption of the process of reproduction, and thus to a real falling

off in reproduction.

    But  there  would  have  been  still  other  agencies  at  work  at  the

same time. The stagnation of production would have laid off a part of

the working class and would thereby have placed the employed part in

a situation, where it would have to submit to a reduction of wages

even below the average. This has the very same effect on capital as

an increase of the relative or absolute surplus value at average wages

would have had. Prosperity would have led to more marriages among

laborers  and  reduced  the  decimation  of  offspring.  While  implying  a

real increase in population, this does not signify an increase in the

actual working population. But it affects the relations of the laborer to

capital  in  the  same  way  as  an  increase  of  the  number  of  actually

working laborers would have affected them. On the other hand, the fall

in  prices  and  the  competitive  struggle  would  have  driven  every

capitalist to lower the individual value of his total product below its

general value by means of new machines, new and improved working

methods,  new  combinations,  i.e.,  to  increase  the  productivity  of  a

given quantity of labor, to lower the proportion of variable to constant

capital, and thereby to release some laborers; in short, to create an

artificial over-population. Ultimately, the depreciation of the elements

of  constant  capital  would  itself  tend  to  raise  the  rate  of  profit.  The

mass of employed constant capital would have increased in relation to

variable, but its value could have fallen. The ensuing stagnation ofproduction  would  have  prepared  —  within  capitalistic  limits  —  a

subsequent expansion of production.

    And thus the cycle would run its course anew. Part of the capital,

depreciated by its functional stagnation, would recover its old value.

For the rest, the same vicious circle would be described once more

under expanded conditions of production, with an expanded market

and increased productive forces [...]

    The limitations of the capitalist mode of production come to the

surface:

    1) In that the development of the productivity of labor creates out

of the falling rate of profit a law which at a certain point comes into

antagonistic  conflict  with  this  development  and  must  be  overcome

constantly through crises.

    2)  In  that  the  expansion  or  contraction  of  production  are

determined by the appropriation of unpaid labor and the proportion of

this  unpaid  labor  to  materialized  labor  in  general,  or,  to  speak  the

language of the capitalists, by profit and the proportion of this profit to

the employed capital, thus by a definite rate of profit, rather than the

relation of production to social requirements, i.e., to the requirements

of  socially  developed  human  beings.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the

capitalist  mode  of  production  meets  with  barriers  at  a  certain

expanded stage of production which, if viewed from the other premise,

would  reversely  have  been  altogether  inadequate.  It  comes  to  a

standstill at a point fixed by the production and realization of profit,

and not the satisfaction of requirements [...]      PART 4: CONVERSION OF COMMODITY CAPITAL

  AND MONEY CAPITAL INTO COMMERCIAL CAPITAL

      AND MONEY-DEALING CAPITAL (MERCHANT S

                                      CAPITAL)                          Chapter 16: Commercial Capital



    Merchant's, or trading, capital breaks up into two forms or sub-

divisions,  namely,  commercial  capital  and  money-dealing  capital,

which we shall now define more closely, in so far as this is necessary

for our analysis of capital in its basic structure. This is all the more

necessary, because modern political economy, even in the persons of

its  best  exponents,  throws  trading  capital  and  industrial  capital

indiscriminately  together  and,  in  effect,  wholly  overlooks  the

characteristic peculiarities of the former.

    The  movements  of  commodity  capital  have  been  analyzed  in

Book II. To take the total capital of society, one part of it — always

made up of different elements and even changing in magnitude —

always  exists  in  the  form  of  commodities  on  the  market,  to  be

converted into money. Another part exists on the market in the form of

money, to be converted into commodities.

    It  is  always  in  the  process  of  this  transition,  of  this  formal

metamorphosis. Inasmuch as this function of capital in the process of

circulation is at all set apart as a special function of a special capital,

as a function established by virtue of the division of labor to a special

group of capitalists, commodity capital becomes commercial capital.

    We  have  explained  (Book  II,  Chapter  VI,  "The  Costs  of

Circulation,”)  to  what  extent  the  transport  industry,  storage  and

distribution of commodities in a distributable form, may be regarded as

production  processes  continuing  within  the  process  of  circulation.

These episodes incidental to the circulation of commodity capital are

sometimes  confused  with  the  distinct  functions  of  merchant’s  or

commercial capital. Sometimes they are, indeed, practically bound up

with these distinct, specific functions, although with the development

of the social division of labor the function of merchant’s capital evolves

in  a  pure  form,  i.e.,  divorced  from  those  real  functions,  and

independent of them. Those functions are therefore irrelevant to our

purpose, which is to define the specific difference of this special form

of  capital.  In  so  far  as  capital  solely  employed  in  the  circulation

process, special commercial capital, partly combines those functionswith its specific ones, it does not appear in its pure form. We obtain its

pure form after stripping it of all these incidental functions [...]

    We have seen that the existence of capital as commodity capital

and the metamorphosis it undergoes within the sphere of circulation in

the market as commodity capital — a metamorphosis which resolves

itself into buying and selling, converting commodity capital into money

capital and money capital into commodity capital — that this forms a

phase in the reproduction process of industrial capital, hence in its

process of production as a whole. We have also seen, however, that it

is  distinguished  in  its  function  as  a  capital  of  circulation  from  its

function as productive capital. These are two different and separate

forms of existence of the same capital [...]

    Commercial capital is nothing but a transmuted form of a part of

this capital of circulation constantly to be found in the market, ever in

the process of its metamorphosis, and always encompassed by the

sphere of circulation. We say a part, because a part of the selling and

buying of commodities always takes place directly between industrial

capitalists.  We  leave  this  part  entirely  out  of  consideration  in  this

analysis, because it contributes nothing to defining the conception, or

to  understanding  the  specific  nature  of  merchant’s  capital,  and

because it has furthermore been exhaustively treated for our purpose

in Book II [...]

    The dealer in commodities, as a capitalist generally, appears on

the market primarily as the representative of a certain sum of money,

which he advances as a capitalist, i.e., which he wants to turn from x

(its original value) into x + Ax (the original sum plus profit). But it is

evident to him — not being just a capitalist in general, but rather a

special dealer in commodities — that his capital must first enter the

market  in  the  form  of  money  capital,  for  he  does  not  produce

commodities. He merely trades in them, expedites their movement,

and to operate with them he must first buy them, and, therefore, must

be in possession of money capital.

    Suppose  that  a  dealer  in  commodities  owns  £3,000  which  he

invests as a trading capital. With these £3,000 he buys, say, 30,000

yards of linen from some linen manufacturer at 2s. per yard. He then

sells the 30,000 yards. If the annual average rate of profit = 10% and

he  makes  an  annual  profit  of  10%  after  deducting  all  incidentalexpenses, then by the end of the year he has converted his £3,000

into £3,300. How he makes this profit is a question which we shall

discuss later. At present, we intend to consider solely the form of the

movements of his capital. With his £3,000 he keeps buying linen and

selling it; he constantly repeats this operation of buying in order to sell,

M — C — M’, the simple form of capital as it obtains entirely in the

process of circulation, uninterrupted by the production process, which

lies outside its own movement and function.

    What is now the relation of this commercial capital to commodity

capital as a mere form of existence of industrial capital? So far as the

linen manufacturer is concerned, he has realized the value of his linen

with the merchant’s money and thereby completed the first phase in

the  metamorphosis  of  his  commodity  capital  —  its  conversion  into

money.  Other  conditions  being  equal,  he  can  now  proceed  to

reconvert this money into yarn, coal, wages, etc., and into means of

existence, etc., for the consumption of his revenue. Hence, leaving

aside  the  revenue  expenditure,  he  can  go  on  with  his  process  of

reproduction.

    But while the sale of the linen, its metamorphosis into money, has

taken place for him, as producer, it has not yet taken place for the

linen itself. It is still on the market as commodity capital awaiting to

undergo its first metamorphosis — to be sold. Nothing has happened

to this linen besides a change in the person of its owner. As concerns

its purpose, as concerns its place in the process, it is still commodity

capital, a saleable commodity, with the only difference that it is now in

the merchant’s hands instead of the manufacturer’s. The function of

selling it, of effecting the first phase of its metamorphosis, has passed

from  the  manufacturer  to  the  merchant,  has  become  the  special

business of the merchant, whereas previously it was a function which

the  producer  had  to  perform  himself  after  having  completed  the

function of its production.

    Let us assume that the merchant fails to sell the 30,000 yards of

linen during the interval required by the linen manufacturer to bring

another 30,000 yards to market at a value of £3,000. The merchant

cannot  buy  them  again,  because  he  still  has  in  stock  the  unsold

30,000  yards  which  have  not  as  yet  been  reconverted  into  money

capital. A stoppage ensues, i.e., an interruption of reproduction. Thelinen producer might, of course, have additional money capital at his

disposal, which he could convert into productive capital, regardless of

the  sale  of  the  30,000  yards,  in  order  to  continue  the  production

process. But this would not alter the situation. So far as the capital tied

up  in  the  30,000  yards  of  linen  is  concerned,  its  process  of

reproduction  is,  and  remains,  interrupted.  It  is,  indeed,  easily  seen

here that the merchant’s operations are really nothing but operations

that  must  be  performed  at  all  events  to  convert  the  producer’s

commodity capital into money. They are operations which effect the

functions  of  commodity  capital  in  the  circulation  and  reproduction

processes.  If  it  devolved  upon  the  producer’s  clerk  to  attend

exclusively  to  the  sale,  and  also  the  purchase,  instead  of  an

independent merchant, this connection would not be obscured for a

single moment.

    Commercial  capital  is,  therefore,  nothing  but  the  producer’s

commodity — capital which has to undergo the process of conversion

into  money  —  to  perform  its  function  of  commodity  capital  on  the

market — the only difference being that instead of representing an

incidental function of the producer, it is now the exclusive operation of

a  special  kind  of  capitalist,  the  merchant,  and  is  set  apart  as  the

business of a special investment of capital [...]

    [M]erchant’s capital does not first have to buy commodities for its

full  amount  of  value,  and  then  to  sell  them.  Instead,  the  merchant

performs both movements simultaneously. His capital then breaks up

into two parts. One of them consists of commodity capital, and the

other  of  money  capital.  He  buys  and  converts  his  money  into

commodities at one place. Elsewhere, he sells and converts another

part  of  his  commodity  capital  into  money.  On  one  side,  his  capital

returns to him in the form of money capital, while on the other he gets

commodity capital. The larger the portion in one form, the smaller the

portion in the other. This alternates and balances itself. If the use of

money as a medium of circulation combines with its use as a means

of payment and the attendant development of the credit system, then

the money capital part of merchant’s capital is reduced still more in

relation  to  the  volume  of  the  transactions  this  merchant’s  capital

effects. If I buy £3,000 worth of wine on three months’ credit and sell

all the wine for cash before this term expires, I do not need to advancea  single  penny  for  these  transactions.  In  this  case  it  is  also  quite

obvious that the money capital, which here acts as merchant’s capital,

is nothing more than industrial capital in its money capital form, in its

process of reflux in the form of money. (The fact that the manufacturer

who sold £3,000 worth of wine on three months’ credit may discount

his promissory note at the banker’s does not alter the matter at all and

has nothing to do with the merchant’s capital.) If market prices should

fall in the meantime by, say, 1/10, the merchant, far from making a

profit, would recover only £2,700 instead of £3,000. He would have to

put up £300 out of his own pocket. These £300 would serve merely as

a reserve to balance the difference in price. But the same applies to

the manufacturer. If he himself had sold at falling prices, he would

likewise have lost £300, and would not be able to resume production

on the same scale without reserve capital.

    The  linen  merchant  buys  £3,000  worth  of  linen  from  the

manufacturer. The latter pays, say, £2,000 of the £3,000 for yarn. He

buys this yarn from a yarn dealer. The money which the manufacturer

pays to the yarn dealer is not the linen dealer’s money, for the latter

has received commodities to this amount. It is the money form of the

manufacturer’s own capital. Now in the hands of the yarn dealer these

£2,000 appear as returned money capital. But to what extent are they

that  as  distinct  from  the  £2,000  representing  the  discarded  money

form of the linen and the assumed money form of the yarn? If the yarn

dealer bought on credit and sold for cash before the expiration of his

term  of  payment,  then  these  £2,000  do  not  contain  one  penny  of

merchant’s capital as distinct from the money form which the industrial

capital  itself  assumes  in  the  course  of  its  circuit.  In  so  far  as

commercial capital is not, therefore, just a form of industrial capital in

the merchant’s hands as commodity- or money capital, it is nothing

but  that  portion  of  money  capital  which  belongs  directly  to  the

merchant and circulates in the purchase and sale of commodities. On

a reduced scale this portion represents that part of capital advanced

for production which should always have to be in the hands of the

industrialist  as  money  reserve  and  means  of  purchase,  and  which

should always have to circulate as his money capital. This portion, on

a  reduced  scale,  is  now  in  the  hands  of  merchant  capitalists  and

performs its functions as such in the process of circulation. It is thatportion  of  the  total  capital  which,  aside  from  what  is  expended  as

revenue,  must  continually  circulate  on  the  market  as  a  means  of

purchase  in  order  to  maintain  the  continuity  of  the  process  of

reproduction.  The  more  rapid  the  process  of  reproduction,  and  the

more developed the function of money as a means of payment, i.e.,

the more developed the credit system, the smaller that portion is in

relation to the total capital.

    Merchant’s capital is simply capital functioning in the sphere of

circulation. The process of circulation is a phase of the total process of

reproduction. But no value is produced in the process of circulation,

and, therefore, no surplus value. Only changes of form of the same

mass of value take place. In fact, nothing occurs there outside the

metamorphosis of commodities, and this has nothing to do as such

either  with  the  creation  or  change  of  values.  If  a  surplus  value  is

realized  in  the  sale  of  produced  commodities,  then  this  is  only

because it already existed in them. In the second act, the re-exchange

of money capital against commodities (elements of production), the

buyer therefore does not realize any surplus value either.

    He  merely  initiates  the  production  of  surplus  value  through

exchanging his money for means of production and labor power. But

so far as these metamorphoses require circulation time — time during

which capital does not produce at all, least of all surplus value — it

restricts the creation of values, and the surplus value expresses itself

through  the  rate  of  profit  in  inverse  ratio  to  the  duration  of  the

circulation period. Merchant's capital, therefore, does not create either

value or surplus value, at least not directly. In so far as it contributes to

shortening the time of circulation, it may help indirectly to increase the

surplus  value  produced  by  the  industrial  capitalists.  In  so  far  as  it

helps to expand the market and effects the division of labor between

capitals,  hence  enabling  capital  to  operate  on  a  larger  scale,  its

function  promotes  the  productivity  of  industrial  capital,  and  its

accumulation. In so far as it shortens circulation time, it raises the ratio

of surplus value to advanced capital, hence the rate of profit. And to

the extent that it confines a smaller portion of capital to the sphere of

circulation in the form of money capital, it increases that portion of

capital which is engaged directly in production.                          Chapter 17: Commercial Profit



    We have seen in Book II that the pure functions of capital in the

sphere of Circulation — the operations which the industrial capitalist

must  perform,  first,  to  realize  the  value  of  his  commodities,  and

second, to reconvert this value into elements of production, operations

effecting the metamorphosis of commodity capital, C — M — C, hence

the acts of selling and buying — produce neither value nor surplus

value.  It  was  rather  seen  that  the  time  required  for  this  purpose,

objectively in regard to commodities and subjectively in regard to the

capitalist, sets the limit to the production of value and surplus value.

What is true of the metamorphosis of commodity capital in general, is,

of course, not in the least altered by the fact that a part of it may

assume  the  shape  of  commercial  capital,  or  that  the  operations,

effecting  the  metamorphosis  of  commodity  capital,  appear  as  the

special concern of a special group of capitalists, or as the exclusive

function  of  a  portion  of  the  money  capital.  If  selling  and  buying

commodities  —  and  that  is  what  the  metamorphosis  of  commodity

capital C — M — C amounts to — by industrial capitalists themselves

are  not  operations  which  create  value  or  surplus  value,  they  will

certainly not create either of these when carried out by persons other

than the industrial capitalists. Furthermore, if that portion of the total

social capital, which must continually be on hand as money capital, in

order that the process of reproduction is not interrupted by the process

of  circulation  and  proceeds  continuously  —  if  this  money  capital

creates  neither  value  nor  surplus  value,  it  cannot  acquire  the

properties of creating them by being continually thrown into circulation

by some section of capitalists other than the industrial capitalists, to

perform the same function. We have already indicated to what extent

merchant’s  capital  may  be  indirectly  productive,  and  we  shall  later

discuss this point at greater length.

    Commercial  capital,  therefore  —  stripped  of  all  heterogeneous

functions,  such  as  storing,  expressing,  transporting,  distributing,retailing,  which  may  be  connected  with  it,  and  confined  to  its  true

function of buying in order to sell — creates neither value nor surplus

value,  but  acts  as  middleman  in  their  realization  and  thereby

simultaneously  in  the  actual  exchange  of  commodities,  i.e.,  in  their

transfer from hand to hand, in the social metabolism. Nevertheless,

since the circulation phase of industrial capital is just as much a phase

of  the  reproduction  process  as  production  is,  the  capital  operating

independently  in  the  process  of  circulation  must  yield  the  average

annual profit just as well as capital operating in the various branches

of production. Should merchant’s capital yield a higher percentage of

average profit than industrial capital, then a portion of the latter would

transform itself into merchant’s capital. Should it yield a lower average

profit,  then  the  converse  would  result?  A  portion  of  the  merchant’s

capital would then be transformed into industrial capital. No species of

capital  changes  its  purpose,  or  function,  with  greater  ease  than

merchant’s capital.

    Since merchant’s capital does not itself produce surplus value, it

is  evident  that  the  surplus  value  which  it  pockets  in  the  form  of

average profit must be a portion of the surplus value produced by the

total  productive  capital.  But  now  the  question  arises:  How  does

merchant’s  capital  attract  its  share  of  the  surplus  value  or  profit

produced by the productive capital?

    It is just an illusion that commercial profit is a mere addition to, or

a nominal rise of, the prices of commodities in excess of their value.

    It is plain that the merchant can draw his profit only out of the

price of the commodities he sells, and plainer still that the profit he

makes  in  selling  his  commodities  must  be  equal  to  the  difference

between  his  purchase  price  and  his  selling  price,  i.e.,  equal  to  the

excess of the latter over the former.

    It is possible that additional costs (costs of circulation) may enter

into the commodities after their purchase and before their sale, and it

is also possible that this may not happen. If such costs should occur, it

is plain that the excess of the selling price over the purchase price

would not be all profit. To simplify the analysis, we shall assume at

this point that no such costs occur.

    For the industrial capitalist the difference between the selling price

and the purchase price of his commodities is equal to the differencebetween  their  price  of  production  and  their  cost  price,  or,  from  the

standpoint of the total social capital, equal to the difference between

the value of the commodities and their cost price for the capitalists,

which again comes down to the difference between the total quantity

of labor and the quantity of paid labor incorporated in them. Before the

commodities bought by the industrial capitalist are thrown back on the

market  as  saleable  commodities,  they  pass  through  the  process  of

production, in which alone the portion of their price to be realized as

profit is created. But it is different with the merchant. The commodities

are in his hands only so long as they are in the process of circulation.

He merely continues their sale, the realization of their price which was

begun by the productive capitalist, and therefore does not cause them

to pass through any intermediate process in which they could again

absorb surplus value. While the industrial capitalist merely realizes the

previously  produced  surplus  value,  or  profit,  in  the  process  of

circulation, the merchant has not only to realize his profit during and

through  circulation,  but  must  first  make  it.  There  appears  to  be  no

other way of doing this outside of selling the commodities bought by

him from the industrial capitalist at their prices of production, or, from

the standpoint of the total commodity capital, at their values in excess

of their prices of production, making a nominal extra charge to their

prices, hence, selling them, from the standpoint of the total commodity

capital, above their value, and pocketing this excess of their nominal

value over their real value; in short, selling them for more than they

are worth.

    This  method  of  adding  an  extra  charge  is  easy  to  grasp.  For

instance, one yard of linen costs 2s. If I want to make a 10% profit in

reselling it, I must add 1/10 to the price, hence sell the yard at 2s. 2

2/5 d. The difference between its actual price of production and its

selling price is then = 2 2/5d., and this represents a profit of 10% on

2s. This amounts to my selling the yard to the buyer at a price which is

in reality the price of 1 1/10 yard. Or, what amounts to the same, it is

as though I sold to the buyer only 10/11 of a yard for 2s. and kept 1/11

of a yard for myself. In fact, I can buy back 1/11 of a yard for 2 2/5d. at

the  price  of  2s.  2  2/5d.  per  yard.  This  would,  therefore,  be  just  a

roundabout way of sharing in the surplus value and surplus product by

a nominal rise in the price of commodities.    This  is  realization  of  commercial  profit  by  raising  the  price  of

commodities,  as  it  appears  at  first  glance.  And,  indeed,  this  whole

notion  that  profit  originates  from  a  nominal  rise  in  the  price  of

commodities, or from their sale above their value, springs from the

observations of commercial capital.

    But it is quickly apparent on closer inspection that this is mere

illusion. Assuming capitalist production to be predominant, commercial

profit cannot be realized in this manner. (It is here always a question

of  averages,  not  of  isolated  cases.)  Why  do  we  assume  that  the

merchant  can  realize  a  profit  of  no  more  than,  say,  10%  on  his

commodities  by  selling  them  10%  above  their  price  of  production?

Because  we  assume  that  the  producer  of  these  commodities,  the

industrial capitalist (who appears as "the producer” before the outside

world, being the personification of industrial capital), had sold them to

the  dealer  at  their  prices  of  production.  If  the  purchase  price  of

commodities paid by the dealer is equal to their price of production, or,

in the last instance, equal to their value, so that the price of production

or, in the last instance, the value, represent the merchant’s cost price,

then, indeed, the excess of his selling price over his purchase price —

and  this  difference  alone  is  the  source  of  his  profit  —  must  be  an

excess of their commercial price over their price of production, so that

in the final analysis the merchant sells all commodities above their

values. But why was it assumed that the industrial capitalist sells his

commodities to the merchant at their prices of production? Or rather,

what was taken for granted in that assumption? It was that merchant’s

capital did not go into forming the general rate of profit (we are dealing

with it as yet only in its capacity of commercial capital). We proceeded

necessarily from this premise in discussing the general rate of profit,

first, because merchant’s capital as such did not exist for us at the

time, and, second, because average profit, and hence the general rate

of profit, had first to be developed as a levelling of profits or surplus

values  actually  produced  by  the  industrial  capitals  in  the  different

spheres of production. But in the case of merchant’s capital we are

dealing with a capital which shares in the profit without participating in

its production. Hence, it is now necessary to supplement our earlier

exposition.    Suppose, the total industrial capital advanced in the course of the

year = 720c + 180v = 900 (say million £), and that s’ = 100%. The

product therefore = 720c + 180v + 180s. Let us call this product or the

produced commodity capital, C, whose value, or price of production

(since both are identical for the totality of commodities) = 1,080, and

the rate of profit for the total social capital of 900 = 20%. These 20%

are, according to our earlier analyses, the average rate of profit, since

the surplus value is not calculated here on this or that capital of any

particular  composition,  but  on  the  total  industrial  capital  of  average

composition. Thus, C = 1,080, and the rate of profit = 20%. Let us now

assume,  however,  that  aside  from  these  £900  of  industrial  capital,

there are still £100 of merchant’s capital, which shares in the profit pro

rata to its magnitude just as the former. According to our assumption,

it is 1/10 of the total capital of 1,000. Therefore, it participates to the

extent of 1/10 in the total surplus value of 180, and thus secures a

profit of 18%. Actually, then, the profit to be distributed among the

other 1/10 of the total capital is only = 162, or on the capital of 900

likewise = 18%. Hence, the price at which C is sold by the owners of

the industrial capital of 900 to the merchants = 720c + 180v + 162s =

1,062. If the dealer then adds the average profit of 18% to his capital

of 100, he sells the commodities at 1,062 + 18 = 1,080, i.e., at their

price  of  production,  or,  from  the  standpoint  of  the  total  commodity

capital, at their value, although he makes his profit only during and

through the circulation process, and only from an excess of his selling

price over his purchase price. Yet he does not sell the commodities

above  their  value,  or  above  their  price  of  production,  precisely

because he has bought them from the industrial capitalist below their

value, or below their price of production.

    Thus, merchant’s capital enters the formation of the general rate

of profit as a determinant pro rata to its part in the total capital. Hence,

if we say in the given case that the average rate of profit = 18%, it

would = 20%, if it were not that 1/10 of the total capital was merchant’s

capital and the general rate of profit thereby lowered by 1/10. This

leads to a closer and more comprehensive definition of the price of

production. By price of production we mean, just as before, the price

of a commodity = its costs (the value of the constant + variable capital

contained in it) + the average profit. But this average profit is nowdetermined differently. It is determined by the total profit produced by

the  total  productive  capital;  but  not  as  calculated  on  the  total

productive capital alone, so that if this = 900, as assumed above, and

the profit = 180, then the average rate of profit = 180/900 = 20%. But,

rather, as calculated on the total productive + merchant's capital, so

that with 900 productive and 100 merchant's capital, the average rate

of profit = 180/1,000 = 18%. The price of production is, therefore = k

(the costs) + 18, instead of k + 20. The share of the total profit falling

to merchant's capital is thus included in the average rate of profit. The

actual value, or price of production, of the total commodity capital is

therefore = k + p + m (where m is commercial profit).

    The  price  of  production,  or  the  price  at  which  the  industrial

capitalist as such sells his commodities, is thus smaller than the actual

price of production of the commodity; or in terms of all commodities

taken together, the prices at which the class of industrial capitalists

sell their commodities are lower than their value. Hence, in the above

case, 900 (costs) + 18% on 900, or 900 + 162= 1,062. It follows, then,

that in selling a commodity at 118 for which he paid 100 the merchant

does,  indeed,  add  18%  to  the  price.  But  since  this  commodity,  for

which he paid 100, is really worth 118, he does not sell it above its

value. We shall henceforth use the term price of production in this, its

more  precise,  sense.  It  is  evident,  therefore,  that  the  profit  of  the

industrial capitalist equals the excess of the price of production of the

commodity over its cost price, and that commercial profit, as distinct

from this industrial profit, equals the excess of the selling price over

the price of production of the commodity which, for the merchant, is its

purchase price; but that the actual price of the commodity = its price of

production + the commercial profit. Just as industrial capital realizes

only  such  profits  as  already  exist  in  the  value  of  commodities  as

surplus value, so merchant’s capital realizes profits only because the

entire surplus value, or profit, has not as yet been fully realized in the

price  charged  for  the  commodities  by  the  industrial  capitalist.  The

merchant’s selling price thus exceeds the purchase price not because

the former exceeds the total value, but because the latter is below this

value.

    Merchant's  capital,  therefore,  participates  in  levelling  surplus

value to average profit, although it does not take part in its production.Thus,  the  general  rate  of  profit  contains  a  deduction  from  surplus

value due to merchant's capital, hence a deduction from the profit of

industrial capital.

    It follows from the foregoing:

    1) The larger the merchant’s capital in proportion to the industrial

capital, the smaller the rate of industrial profit, and vice versa.

    2) It was demonstrated in the first part that the rate of profit is

always lower than the rate of the actual surplus value, i.e., it always

understates the intensity of exploitation, as in the above case, 720c +

180v + 180s, the rate of surplus value of 100% and a rate of profit of

only 20%. And the difference becomes still greater, inasmuch as the

average rate of profit appears smaller again, dropping from 20% to

18%,  if  the  share  falling  to  merchant’s  capital  is  also  taken  into

account. The average rate of profit of the direct capitalist exploiter,

therefore, expresses a rate of profit smaller than it actually is.

    Assuming  all  other  circumstances  remaining  the  same,  the

relative volume of merchant’s capital (with the exception of the small

dealer who represents a hybrid form) is in inverse proportion to the

velocity of its turnover, hence in inverse proportion to the energy of the

process of reproduction in general. In the course of scientific analysis,

the  formation  of  a  general  rate  of  profit  appears  to  result  from

industrial capitals and their competition, and is only later corrected,

supplemented, and modified by the intervention of merchant's capital.

In the course of its historical development, however, the process is

really reversed. It is the commercial capital which first determines the

prices of commodities more or less in accordance with their values,

and  it  is  the  sphere  of  circulation,  the  sphere  that  promotes  the

process of reproduction, in which a general rate of profit initially takes

shape.  It  is  originally  the  commercial  profit  which  determines  the

industrial  profit.  Not  until  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  has

asserted  itself  and  the  producer  himself  has  become  merchant,  is

commercial profit reduced to that aliquot part of the total surplus value

falling to the share of merchant's capital as an aliquot part of the total

capital engaged in the social process of reproduction.

    It was seen in the supplementary equalization of profit through the

intervention of merchant’s capital that no additional element entered

the  value  of  commodities  with  the  merchant’s  advanced  moneycapital, and that the extra charge to the price, whereby the merchant

makes his profit, was merely equal to that portion of the value of the

commodities, which productive capital had not calculated in the price

of  production,  i.e.,  had  left  out.  The  case  of  this  money  capital  is

similar to that of the industrial capitalist’s fixed capital, since it is not

consumed and its value, therefore, does not make up an element of

the  value  of  commodity.  It  is  in  the  purchase  price  of  commodity

capital  that  the  merchant  replaces  its  price  of  production  =  M,  in

money.  His  own  selling  price,  as  previously  shown,  is  =  M  +  AM,

where  AM  stands  for  the  addition  to  the  price  of  commodities

determined  by  the  general  rate  of  profit.  Once  he  sells  the

commodities, his original money capital, which he advanced for their

purchase, returns to him together with this AM. We see once more

that  his  money  capital  is  nothing  but  the  industrial  capitalist’s

commodity capital transformed into money capital, which affects the

magnitude of the value of this commodity capital no more than would

a direct sale of the latter to the ultimate consumer, instead of to the

merchant.  It,  actually,  merely  anticipates  the  payment  of  the

consumer.  However,  this  is  correct  only  on  the  condition  hitherto

assumed, that the merchant has no overhead expenses, or that aside

from the money capital which he must advance to buy commodities

from the producer he need not advance any other capital, circulating

or fixed, in the process of commodity metamorphosis., the process of

buying and selling. But this is not so in reality, as we have seen in the

analysis of the costs of circulation (Book II, Chap. VI). These costs of

circulation  are  partly  expenses  which  the  merchant  has  to  reclaim

from other agents of circulation, and partly expenses arising directly

from his specific business.

    No matter what the nature of these costs of circulation — whether

they  arise  from  the  purely  commercial  nature  of  the  merchant’s

establishment as such and hence belong to the merchant’s specific

costs  of  circulation,  or  represent  items  which  are  charges  for

subsequent  processes  of  production  added  in  the  process  of

circulation,  such  as  expressage,  transport,  storage,  etc.  —  they

always  require  of  the  merchant,  aside  from  his  money  capital,

advanced to the purchase of commodities, some additional capital for

the purchase and payment of such means of circulation. As much ofthis element of cost as consists of circulating capital passes wholly as

an additional element into the selling price of the commodities; and as

much of it as consists of fixed capital only to the extent of its wear and

tear. But only as an element which forms a nominal value, even if as

the purely commercial costs of circulation, it does not add any real

value to the commodities. But whether fixed or circulating, this entire

additional capital participates in forming the general rate of profit.

    The  purely  commercial  costs  of  circulation  (hence,  excluding

costs of expressage, shipping, storage, etc.) resolve themselves into

costs required to realize the value of commodities, to transform it from

commodities into money, or from money into commodities, to affect

their  exchange.  We  leave  entirely  out  of  consideration  all  possible

processes  of  production  which  may  continue  in  the  process  of

circulation, and from which the merchant’s business can be altogether

separated; as, in fact, the actual transport industry and expressage

may be, and are, industrial branches entirely distinct from commercial;

and purchasable and saleable commodities may be stored in docks or

in  other  public  premises,  with  the  resultant  cost  of  storage  being

charged  to  the  merchant  by  third  persons  inasmuch  as  he  has  to

advance it. All this takes place in actual wholesale commerce, where

merchant’s  capital  appears  in  its  purest  form,  unmixed  with  other

functions. The express company owner, the railway director, and the

ship-owner, are not "merchants". The costs which we consider here

are those of buying and selling. We have already remarked earlier that

these  resolve  themselves  into  accounting,  bookkeeping,  marketing,

correspondence, etc. The constant capital required for this purpose

consists of offices, paper, postage, etc. The other costs break up into

variable  capital  advanced  for  the  employment  of  mercantile  wage

workers. (Expressage, transport costs, advances for customs duties,

etc., may partly be considered as being advanced by the merchant in

purchasing commodities and thus enter the purchase price as far as

he is concerned.)

    All  these  costs  are  not  incurred  in  producing  the  use  value  of

commodities,  but  in  realizing  their  value.  They  are  pure  costs  of

circulation.  They  do  not  enter  into  the  immediate  process  of

production, but since they are part of the process of circulation they

are also part of the total process of reproduction.    The only portion of these costs of interest to us at this point is that

advanced as variable capital. (The following questions should also be

analyzed: First, how does the law that only necessary labor enters the

value of commodities operate in the process of circulation? Second,

how does accumulation obtain in merchant’s capital? Third, how does

merchant’s  capital  function  in  the  actual  aggregate  reproduction

process of society?)

    These costs arise due to the product having the economic form of

a commodity.

    If the labor time which the industrial capitalists themselves lose

while directly selling commodities to one another — hence, speaking

objectively, the circulation time of the commodities — does not add

value to these commodities, it is evident that this labor time does not

change its nature in the least by falling to the merchant instead of the

industrial  capitalist.  The  conversion  of  commodities  (products)  into

money, and of money into commodities (means of production) is a

necessary  function  of  industrial  capital  and,  therefore,  a  necessary

operation of the capitalist — who is actually but personified capital

endowed  with  a  consciousness  of  its  own  and  a  will.  But  these

functions  neither  create  value,  nor  produce  surplus  value.  By

performing these operations and carrying on the functions of capital in

the sphere of circulation after the productive capitalist has ceased to

be  involved  the  merchant  merely  takes  the  place  of  the  industrial

capitalist. The labor time required in these operations is devoted to

certain necessary operations of the reproduction process of capital,

but yields no additional value. If the merchant did not perform these

operations (hence, did not expend the labor time entailed), he would

not be applying his capital as a circulation agent of industrial capital;

he  would  not  then  be  continuing  the  interrupted  function  of  the

industrial  capitalist,  and  consequently  could  not  participate  as  a

capitalist  pro  rata  to  his  advanced  capital,  in  the  mass  of  profit

produced  by  industrial  capitalists.  In  order  to  share  in  the  mass  of

surplus  value,  to  expand  the  value  of  his  advance  as  capital,  the

commercial capitalist need not employ wage workers. If his business

and capital are small, he may be the only worker in it. He is paid with

that  portion  of  the  profit  which  falls  to  him  through  the  differencebetween the purchase price paid by him for commodities and their

actual price of production [...]

    But, on the other hand, the profit realized by the merchant on a

small amount of advanced capital may be no larger, or may even be

smaller,  than  the  wages  of  one  of  the  better-paid  skilled  wage

workers. In fact, he brushes shoulders with many direct commercial

agents of the productive capitalist, such as buyers, sellers, travelers,

who enjoy the same or a higher income either in the form of wages, or

in the form of a share in the profit (percentages, bonuses) made from

each sale. In the first case, the merchant pockets the mercantile profit

as an independent capitalist; in the other, the salesman, the industrial

capitalist’s wage laborer, receives a portion of the profit either in the

form of wages, or as a proportional share in the profit of the industrial

capitalist, whose direct agent he is, while his employer pockets both

the  industrial  and  the  commercial  profit.  But  in  all  these  cases,

although  his  income  may  appear  to  the  circulation  agent  as  an

ordinary  wage,  as  payment  for  work  performed,  [...]  his  income  is

derived solely from the mercantile profit. This follows from his labor

not being labor which produces value [...]

    If the industrial capitalist who acts as his own merchant advances

not  only  the  additional  capital  to  buy  new  commodities  before  his

product in the process of circulation has been reconverted into money,

but  also  capital  (office  expenses  and  wages  for  commercial

employees) to realize the value of his commodity capital, or, in other

words,  for  the  process  of  circulation,  then  these  supplements  form

additional capital, but do not create surplus value.

    They must be made good out of the value of the commodities,

because  a  portion  of  the  value  of  these  commodities  must  be

reconverted  into  these  circulation  costs.  But  no  additional  surplus

value is created thereby. So far as this concerns the total capital of

society,  it  means  in  fact  that  a  portion  of  it  must  be  set  aside  for

secondary operations which are no part of the self-expansion process,

and  that  this  portion  of  the  social  capital  must  be  continually

reproduced  for  this  purpose.  This  reduces  the  rate  of  profit  for  the

individual capitalist and for the entire class of industrial capitalists [...]

    The  question  now  arises:  What  about  the  commercial  wage

workers employed by the commercial capitalist, here the merchant?    In one respect, such a commercial employee is a wage worker

like any other. In the first place, his labor power is bought with the

variable  capital  of  the  merchant,  not  with  money  expended  as

revenue, and consequently it is not bought for private service, but for

the purpose of expanding the value of the capital advanced for it. In

the second place, the value of his labor power, and thus his wages,

are determined as those of other wage workers, i.e., by the cost of

production and reproduction of his specific labor power, not by the

product of his labor.

    However, we must make the same distinction between him and

the wage workers directly employed by industrial capital which exists

between industrial capital and merchant’s capital, and thus between

the industrial capitalist and the merchant. Since the merchant, as a

mere agent of circulation, produces neither value nor surplus value

(for the additional value which he adds to the commodities through his

expenses resolves itself into an addition of previously existing values,

although the question here poses itself, how he preserves this value of

his constant capital?) it follows that the mercantile workers employed

by him in these same functions cannot directly create surplus value for

him.  Here,  as  in  the  case  of  productive  laborers,  we  assume  that

wages are determined by the value of the labor power [...]

    The  difficulty  as  concerns  mercantile  wage  workers  is  by  no

means to explain how they produce direct profits for their employer

without  creating  any  direct  surplus  value  (of  which  profit  is  but  a

transmuted form). This question has, indeed, already been solved in

the general analysis of commercial profits. Just as industrial capital

makes profit by selling labor embodied and realized in commodities,

for which it has not paid any equivalent, so merchant’s capital derives

profit from not paying in full to productive capital for all the unpaid

labor  contained  in  the  commodities  (in  commodities,  in  so  far  as

capital invested in their production functions as an aliquot part of the

total  industrial  capital),  and  by  demanding  payment  for  this  unpaid

portion still contained in the commodities when making a sale. The

relation of merchant’s capital to surplus value is different from that of

industrial  capital.  The  latter  produces  surplus  value  by  directly

appropriating the unpaid labor of others. The former appropriates a

portion of this surplus value by having this portion transferred fromindustrial capital to itself [...] Just as the laborer’s unpaid labor directly

creates surplus value for productive capital, so the unpaid labor of the

commercial  wage  worker  secures  a  share  of  this  surplus  value  for

merchant’s capital [...]

    Since  merchant’s  capital  is  absolutely  nothing  but  an

individualized  form  of  a  portion  of  industrial  capital  engaged  in  the

process of circulation, all questions referring to it must be solved by

representing the problem primarily in a form; in which the phenomena

peculiar to merchant’s capital do not yet appear independently, but still

in direct connection with industrial capital, as a branch of it. As an

office,  distinct  from  a  workshop,  mercantile  capital  operates

continually in the circulation process. It is here — in the office of the

industrial capitalist himself — that we must first analyses the [problem]

now  under  consideration  [...]  The  more  developed  the  scale  of

production,  the  greater,  even  if  not  proportionately  greater,  the

commercial operations of the industrial capital, and consequently the

labor  and  other  costs  of  circulation  involved  in  realizing  value  and

surplus value. This necessitates the employment of commercial wage

workers  who  make  up  the  actual  office  staff.  The  outlay  for  these,

although made in the form of wages, differs from the variable capital

laid out in purchasing productive labor. It increases the outlay of the

industrial capitalist, the mass of the capital to be advanced, without

directly  increasing  surplus  value.  Because  it  is  an  outlay  for  labor

employed solely in realizing value already created. Like every other

outlay of this kind, it reduces the rate of profit be-cause the advanced

capital increases, but not the surplus value. If surplus value s remains

constant while advanced capital C increases to C + AC, then the rate

of profit s/C is replaced by the smaller rate of profit s/(C + AC). The

industrial  capitalist  endeavors,  therefore,  to  cut  these  expenses  of

circulation  down  to  a  minimum,  just  as  his  expenses  for  constant

capital. Hence, industrial capital does not maintain the same attitude

to  its  commercial  wage  laborers  as  it  does  to  its  productive  wage

laborers.  The  more  productive  wage  laborers  it  employs  under

otherwise equal circumstances, the greater the output, and the greater

the surplus value, or profit.

      Conversely,  however,  the  larger  the  scale  of  production,  the

greater  the  quantity  of  value  and  surplus  value  to  be  realized,  thegreater the produced commodity capital, the greater are the absolute,

if not relative, office costs, giving rise to a kind of division of labor. To

what extent profit is the precondition for these outlays, is seen, among

other  things,  from  the  fact  that  with  the  increase  of  commercial

salaries, a part of them is frequently paid by a share in the profit. It is

in  the  nature  of  things  that  labor  consisting  merely  of  intermediate

operations  connected  partly  with  calculating  values,  partly  with

realizing them, and partly with reconverting the realized money into

means of production, is a labor whose magnitude therefore depends

on the quantity of the produced values that have to he realized, and

does not act as the cause, like directly productive labor, but rather as

an effect, of the respective magnitudes and masses of these values.

The same applies to the other costs of circulation [...]

    The commercial worker produces no surplus value directly. But

the price of his labor is determined by the value of his labor power,

hence by its costs of production, while the application of this labor

power, its exertion, expenditure of energy, and wear and tear, is as in

the ease of every other wage laborer by no means limited by its value.

His wage, therefore, is not necessarily proportionate to the mass of

profit  which  he  helps  the  capitalist  to  realize.  What  he  costs  the

capitalist and what he brings in for him, are two different things. He

creates no direct surplus value, but adds to the capitalist’s income by

helping him to reduce the cost of realizing surplus value, inasmuch as

he performs partly unpaid labor [...]

    To  industrial  capital  the  costs  of  circulation  appear  as

unproductive expenses, and so they are. To the merchant they appear

as a source of his profit, proportional, given the general rate of profit,

to  their  size.  The  outlay  to  be  made  for  these  circulation  costs  is,

therefore, a productive investment for mercantile capital. And for this

reason,  the  commercial  labor  which  it  buys  is  likewise  immediately

productive for it.        Chapter 18: The Turnover of Merchant’s Capital. Prices



    The turnover of industrial capital is a combination of its period of

production and time of circulation, and therefore embraces the entire

process of production. The turnover of merchant’s capital, on the other

hand,  being  in  reality  nothing  but  an  alienated  movement  of

commodity  capital,  represents  only  the  first  phase  in  the

metamorphosis of a commodity, C — M, as the refluent movement of

a specific capital; M — C, C — M, is, from the mercantile point of view,

the turnover of merchant’s capital. The merchant buys, converting his

money  into  commodities,  then  sells,  converting  the  latter  back  into

money,  and  so  forth  in  constant  repetition.  Within  circulation,  the

metamorphosis of industrial capital always presents itself in the form

of C1 — M — C2; the money realized by the sale of the produced

commodity C1 is used to purchase new means of production, C2. This

amounts to a practical exchange of C1 for C2, and the same money

thus changes hands twice. Its movement mediates the exchange of

two different kinds of commodities, C1 and C2. But in the case of the

merchant,  it  is,  conversely,  the  same  commodity  which  changes

hands  twice  in  M  —  C  —  M’.  It  merely  promotes  the  reflux  of  his

money.

    If, for example, a certain merchant’s capital is £100, and for these

£100 the merchant buys commodities and sells them for £110, then

his capital of £100 has completed one turnover, and the number of

such  turnovers  per  year  depends  on  the  number  of  times  this

movement M — C — M’ is repeated.

    We here leave entirely out of consideration the costs which may

be concealed in the difference between the purchase price and the

selling price, since these do not alter in any way the form, which we

are now analyzing.

    The number of turnovers of a given merchant’s capital, therefore,

is analogous in this case to the repeated cycles of money as a mere

medium of circulation. Just as the same thaler buys ten times its valuein commodities in making ten cycles, so the same money capital of the

merchant,  when  turned  over  ten  times,  buys  ten  times  its  value  in

commodities,  or  realizes  a  total  commodity  capital  of  ten  times  its

value;  a  merchant’s  capital  of  100,  for  instance,  a  ten-fold  value  =

1,000. But there is this difference: In the cycle of money as a medium

of  circulation  it  is  the  same  piece  of  money  that  passes  through

different  hands,  thus  repeatedly  performing  the  same  function  and

hence making up for the mass of the circulating pieces of money by its

velocity. But in the merchant’s case it is the same money capital, the

same money value, regardless of what pieces of money it may be

composed, which repeatedly buys and sells commodity capital to the

amount of its value and which therefore returns to the same hands,

the same point of departure as M + AM, i.e., value plus surplus value.

This  characterizes  its  turnover  as  a  capital  turnover.  It  always

withdraws  more  money  from  circulation  than  it  throws  in.  It  is  self-

evident, at any rate, that an accelerated turnover of merchant’s capital

(given a developed credit system, the function of money as a means

of payment predominates) implies a more rapid circulation of the same

quantity of money.

    A  repeated  turnover  of  commercial  capital,  however,  never

connotes  more  than  repeated  buying  and  selling;  while  a  repeated

turnover of industrial capital connotes the periodicity and renovation of

the  entire  reproduction  process  (which  includes  the  process  of

consumption).  For  merchant’s  capital  this  appears  merely  as  an

external  condition.  Industrial  capital  must  continually  bring

commodities to the market and withdraw them from it, in order that

rapid  turnover  of  merchant’s  capital  may  remain  possible.  If  the

process of reproduction is slow, then so is the turnover of merchant’s

capital. True, merchant’s capital promotes the turnover of productive

capital, but only in so far as it shortens its time of circulation. It has no

direct influence on the time of production, which is also a barrier to the

period of turnover of industrial capital. This is the first barrier for the

turnover  of  merchant’s  capital.  Secondly,  aside  from  the  barrier

formed  by  reproductive  consumption,  the  turnover  of  merchant’s

capital  is  ultimately  limited  by  the  velocity  and  volume  of  the  total

individual consumption, since all the commodity capital which is part of

the consumption fund depends on it.    However, (aside from the turnovers in the world of commerce, in

which one merchant always sells the same commodity to another, and

this  sort  of  circulation  may  appear  highly  prosperous  in  times  of

speculation), the merchant’s capital, in the first place, curtails phase C

— M for productive capital. Secondly, under the modern credit system

it disposes of a large portion of the total social money capital, so that it

can repeat its purchases even before it has definitely sold what has

previously been purchased. And it is immaterial in this case, whether

our merchant sells directly to the ultimate consumer, or there are a

dozen  other  intermediate  merchants  between  them.  Owing  to  the

immense elasticity of the reproduction process, which may always be

pushed beyond any given bounds, it does not encounter any obstacle

in  production  itself,  or  at  best  a  very  elastic  one.  Aside  from  the

separation of C — M and M — C, which follows from the nature of the

commodities,  a  fictitious  demand  is  then  created.  In  spite  of  its

independent status, the movement of merchant’s capital is never more

than the movement of industrial capital within the sphere of circulation.

But by virtue of its independent status it moves, within certain limits,

independently of the bounds of the reproduction process and thereby

even drives the latter beyond its bounds. This internal dependence

and external independence push merchant’s capital to a point where

the internal connection is violently restored through a crisis.

    Hence the phenomenon that crises do not come to the surface, do

not  break  out,  in  the  retail  business  first,  which  deals  with  direct

consumption, but in the spheres of wholesale trade, and of banking,

which  places  the  money  capital  of  society  at  the  disposal  of  the

former.

    The  manufacturer  may  actually  sell  to  the  exporter,  and  the

exporter, in his turn, to his foreign customer; the importer may sell his

raw materials to the manufacturer, and the latter may sell his products

to the wholesale merchant, etc. But at some particular imperceptible

point  the  goods  lie  unsold,  or  else,  again,  all  producers  and

middlemen may gradually become overstocked. Consumption is then

generally at its highest, either because one industrial capitalist sets a

succession of others in motion; or because the laborers employed by

them  are  fully  employed  and  have  more  to  spend  than  usual.  The

capitalists’ expenditures increase together with their growing income.Besides, as we have seen (Book II, Part III), continuous circulation

takes  place  between  constant  capital  and  constant  capital  (even

regardless of accelerated accumulation). It is at first independent of

individual  consumption  because  it  never  enters  the  latter.  But  this

consumption definitely limits it nevertheless, since constant capital is

never  produced  for  its  own  sake  but  solely  because  more  of  it  is

needed  in  spheres  of  production  whose  products  go  into  individual

consumption.  However,  this  may  go  on  undisturbed  for  some  time,

stimulated by prospective demand, and in such branches, therefore,

the business of merchants and industrialists goes briskly forth. The

crisis  occurs  when  the  returns  of  merchants  who  sell  in  distant

markets  (or  whose  supplies  have  also  accumulated  on  the  home

market)  become  so  slow  and  meagre  that  the  banks  press  for

payment,  or  promissory  notes  for  purchased  commodities  become

due before the latter have been resold. Then forced sales take place,

sales in order to meet payments. Then comes the crash, which brings

the illusory prosperity to an abrupt end.

    But  the  superficiality  and  meaninglessness  of  the  turnover  of

merchant’s capital are still greater, because the turnover of one and

the  same  merchant’s  capital  may  simultaneously  or  successively

promote the turnovers of several productive capitals.

    The  turnover  of  merchant’s  capital  does  not  just  promote  the

turnovers  of  several  industrial  capitals,  it  can  also  expedite  the

opposite  phases  of  the  metamorphosis  of  commodity  capital.  For

instance, the merchant buys linen from the manufacturer and sells it to

the  bleacher.  In  this  case,  therefore  the  turnover  of  the  same

merchant’s capital — in fact, the same C — M, a realization of the

linen  —  represents  two  opposite  phases  for  two  different  industrial

capitals. Inasmuch as the merchant sells for productive consumption,

his C — M is always M — C for one industrial capitalist, and his M —

C always C — M for another industrial capitalist.

    If we leave out K, the circulation costs, as we do in this Chapter,

if,  in  other  words,  we  leave  aside  that  portion  of  capital  which  the

merchant  advances  along  with  the  money  required  to  purchase

commodities, it follows that we also omit AK, the additional profit made

on  this  additional  capital.  This  is  thus  the  strictly  logical  andmathematically correct mode of analysis if we want to see how profit

and turnover of merchant’s capital affect prices.

    If the price of production of 1 lb. of sugar were £1, the merchant

could  buy  100  lbs.  of  sugar  with  £100.  If  he  buys  and  sells  this

quantity in the course of the year, and if the average annual rate of

profit is 15%, he would add £15 to the £100, and 3s. to £1, the price of

production of 1 lb. of sugar. That is, he would sell 1 lb. of sugar at

£1.3s. But if the price of production of 1 lb. of sugar should fall to 1s.,

the merchant could buy 2,000 lbs. of sugar with £100, and sell the

sugar at 1s. 1 4/5d. per lb. The annual profit on capital invested in the

sugar business would still be £15 on each £100. But the merchant has

to sell 100 lbs. in the first case, and 2,000 lbs. in the second. The high

or low level of the price of production has nothing to do with the rate of

profit. But it would greatly and decisively affect that aliquot part of the

selling price of each lb. of sugar, which resolves itself in mercantile

profit, i.e., the addition to the price which the merchant makes on a

certain quantity of commodities or products. If the price of production

of a commodity is small, so, too, the amount the merchant advances

in its purchase price, i.e., for a certain quantity of it. Hence, with a

given rate of profit, the amount of profit he makes on this quantity of

cheap commodities is small as well. Or, what amounts to the same, he

can  then  buy  with  a  certain  amount  of  capital,  say,  100,  a  larger

quantity of these cheap commodities, and the total profit of 15, which

he makes per 100, breaks up into small fractions over each individual

piece or portion belonging to this mass of commodities. If the opposite

takes place, then the reverse is true.

    This depends entirely on the greater or smaller productivity of the

industrial capital in whose products he trades. If we except the cases

in  which  the  merchant  is  a  monopolist  and  simultaneously

monopolizes production, as did the Dutch East India Company in its

day,  nothing  can  be  more  ridiculous  than  the  current  idea  that  it

depends on the merchant whether he sells many commodities at a

small  profit  or  few  commodities  at  a  large  profit  on  each  individual

piece of the commodities. The two limits of his selling price are: on the

one hand, the price of production of the commodities, over which he

has  no  control;  on  the  other  hand,  the  average  rate  of  profit,  over

which he has just as little control. The only thing up to him to decide iswhether he wants to deal in dear or in cheap commodities, and even

here  the  size  of  his  available  capital  and  other  circumstances  also

have  their  effect.  Therefore,  it  depends  wholly  on  the  degree  of

development  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  not  on  the

merchant’s goodwill, what course he shall follow [...]

    The greater the number of turnovers of an industrial capital under

conditions described in Book II, Part II, the greater the mass of profit it

creates. True, through the formation of a general rate of profit, the

total profit is distributed among the different capitals not in proportion

to their actual part in its production, but in proportion to the aliquot part

they make up of the total capital, i.e., in proportion to their magnitude.

But  this  does  not  alter  the  essence  of  the  matter.  The  greater  the

number of turnovers of the total industrial capital, the greater the mass

of  profits,  the  mass  of  annually  produced  surplus  value,  and,

therefore,  other  circumstances  remaining  unchanged,  the  rate  of

profit. It is different with merchant’s capital. The rate of profit is a given

magnitude with respect to it, determined on the one hand by the mass

of profit produced by industrial capital, and on the other by the relative

magnitude of the total merchant’s capital, by its quantitative relation to

the  sum  of  capital  advanced  in  the  processes  of  production  and

circulation. The number of its turnovers does, indeed, decisively affect

its relation to the total capital, or the relative magnitude of merchant’s

capital required for the circulation, for it is evident that the absolute

magnitude of the required merchant’s capital and the velocity of its

turnovers  stand  in  inverse  proportion.  But,  all  other  conditions

remaining equal, the relative magnitude of merchant’s capital, or the

part  it  makes  up  of  the  total  capital,  is  determined  by  its  absolute

magnitude. If the total capital is 10,000, and the merchant’s capital

1/10 of that sum, it is = 1,000; if the total capital is 1,000, then 1/10 of

it = 100.

    The absolute magnitude of merchant's capital varies, depending

on the magnitude of the total capital, although its relative magnitude

remains the same. But here we assume that its relative magnitude,

say,  1/10  of  the  total  capital,  is  given.  This  relative  magnitude,

however,  is  again  determined  by  the  turnover.  If  it  is  turned  over

rapidly, its absolute magnitude, for example, will = £1,000 in the first

case, = 100 in the second, and hence its relative magnitude = 1/10.With a slower turnover its absolute magnitude is, say, = 2,000 in the

first case, and = 200 in the second. Its relative magnitude will then

have increased from 1/10 to 1/5 of the total capital. Circumstances

which  reduce  the  average  turnover  of  merchant’s  capital,  like  the

development of means of transportation, for instance, reduce pro tanto

the absolute magnitude of merchant’s capital, and thereby increase

the general rate of profit. If the opposite takes place, then the reverse

is true [...]

    But, assuming the relative magnitude of merchant’s capital to total

capital to be given, the difference of turnovers in the various branches

of commerce does not affect either the magnitude of the total profit

falling to the share of merchant’s capital, or the general rate of profit.

The merchant’s profit is not determined by the mass of commodity

capital turned over by him, but by the dimensions of the money capital

advanced by him to promote this turnover. If the general annual rate of

profit is 15%, and the merchant advances £100, which he turns over

once a year, he will sell his commodities at 115. If his capital turns

over five times a year, he will sell a commodity capital he bought at

100 at 103 five times a year, hence in a year a commodity capital of

500 at 515. This gives the same annual profit of 15 on his advanced

capital of 100. If this were not so, merchant’s capital would yield a

much higher profit, proportionate to the number of its turnovers, than

industrial capital, which would be in conflict with the law of the general

rate of profit.

    Hence,  the  number  of  turnovers  of  merchant’s  capital  in  the

various  branches  of  commerce  has  a  direct  influence  on  the

mercantile prices of commodities. The amount added to the mercantile

price, the aliquot part of mercantile profit of a given capital, which falls

upon the price of production of a commodity, is in inverse proportion to

the  number  of  turnovers,  or  the  velocity  of  turnover,  of  merchants’

capitals  in  the  various  lines  of  commerce.  If  a  certain  merchant’s

capital  is  turned  over  five  times  a  year,  it  will  add  to  a  commodity

capital  of  equal  value  but  1/5  of  what  another  merchant’s  capital,

which  turns  over  just  once  a  year,  adds  to  a  commodity  capital  of

equal value.

    The  modification  of  selling  prices  by  the  average  period  of

turnover of capitals in different branches of commerce amounts to this:The  same  mass  of  profits,  determined  for  any  given  magnitude  of

merchant’s  capital  by  the  general  annual  rate  of  profit,  hence

determined independently of the specific character of the commercial

operations of this capital, is differently distributed — proportionately to

the rate of turnover — over masses of commodities of equal value, so

that, for instance, if a merchant’s capital is turned over five times a

year, 15/5 = 3% if once a year, 15%, is added to the price of the

commodities.

    The same percentage of commercial profit in different branches of

commerce, therefore, increases the selling prices of commodities by

quite  different  percentages  of  their  values,  all  depending  on  their

periods of turnover.

    On the other hand, in the case of industrial capital, the period of

turnover  does  not  in  any  way  affect  the  magnitude  of  the  value  of

individual commodities produced, although it does affect the mass of

values and surplus values produced in a given time by a given capital,

because it affects the mass of exploited labor. This is concealed, to be

sure, and seems to be otherwise as soon as one turns to prices of

production.  But  this  is  due  solely  to  the  fact  that,  according  to

previously  analyzed  laws,  the  prices  of  production  of  various

commodities deviate from their values. If we look upon the process of

production as a whole, and upon the mass of commodities produced

by the total industrial capital, we shall at once find the general law

vindicated [...]                        Chapter 19: Money-Dealing Capital



    The  purely  technical  movements  performed  by  money  in  the

circulation  process  of  industrial,  and,  as  we  may  now  add,  of

commercial  capital  (since  it  takes  over  a  part  of  the  circulation

movement  of  industrial  capital  as  its  own,  peculiar  movement),  if

individualized as a function of some particular capital performing just

these, and only these, operations as its specific operations, convert

this capital into money-dealing capital. A portion of industrial capital,

and, more precisely, also of commercial capital, not only obtains all

the time in the form of money, as money capital in general, but as

money  capital  engaged  precisely  in  these  technical  functions.  A

definite  part  of  the  total  capital  dissociates  itself  from  the  rest  and

stands apart in the form of money capital, whose capitalist function

consists exclusively in performing these operations for the entire class

of industrial and commercial capitalists. As in the case of commercial

capital,  a  portion  of  industrial  capital  engaged  in  the  circulation

process  in  the  form  of  money  capital  separates  from  the  rest  and

performs these operations of the reproduction process for all the other

capital.  The  movements  of  this  money  capital  are,  therefore,  once

more merely movements of an individualized part of industrial capital

engaged in the reproduction process [...]

    This purely technical operation of disbursing and receiving money

is in itself labor which, as long as the money serves as a means of

payment,  necessitates  drawing  up  payment  balances  and  acts  of

balancing accounts.

    This labor is a cost of circulation, i.e., not labor creating value. It is

shortened  in  being  carried  out  by  a  special  section  of  agents,  or

capitalists, for the rest of the capitalist class.

    A definite portion of the capital must be on hand constantly as a

hoard, as potential money capital — a reserve of means of purchase,

a reserve of means of payment, and idle capital in the form of money

waiting to be put to work. Another portion streams back continually inthis form. Aside from collecting, paying, and bookkeeping, this entails

safekeeping the hoard, which is an operation all in itself. It is, indeed,

a continuous conversion of the hoard into means of circulation and

means of payment, and its restoration by means of money secured

through sales and from payments due. This constant movement of the

part  of  capital  existing  as  money,  dissociated  from  the  function  of

capital itself, this purely technical function, causes its own labor and

expense, classified as costs of circulation.

    The  division  of  labor  brings  it  about  that  these  technical

operations,  dependent  upon  the  functions  of  capital,  should  be

performed  for  the  entire  capitalist  class  as  much  as  possible  by  a

special section of agents or capitalists as their exclusive function — or

that these operations should be concentrated in their hands. We have

here, as in merchant’s capital, division of labor in a two-fold sense. It

becomes  a  specialized  business,  and  because  performed  as  a

specialized business for the money-mechanism of the whole class, it

is concentrated and conducted on a large scale. A further division of

labor  takes  place  within  it,  both  through  division  into  various

independent branches, and through segmentation of work within these

branches  (large  offices,  numerous  book-keepers  and  cashiers,  and

far-reaching division of labor). Paying and receiving money, settling

accounts, keeping current accounts, storing money, etc. — all this,

dissociated  from  the  acts  necessitating  these  technical  operations,

makes  money-dealing  capital  of  the  capital  advanced  for  these

functions.

    The  various  operations,  whose  individualization  into  specific

businesses gives rise to the money trade, spring from the different

purposes of money itself and from its functions, which capital in its

money form must therefore likewise carry out.

    I have pointed out earlier that finance developed originally from

the exchange of products between different communities [(Zur Kritik

der politischen Oekonomie, S. 27)].

    Trading  in  money,  commerce  in  the  money  commodity,  first

developed  therefore  out  of  international  commerce.  Ever  since

different  national  coins  have  existed  merchants  buying  in  foreign

countries have had to exchange their national coins for local coins,

and vice versa, or to exchange different coins for uncoined pure silveror gold — the world money. Hence the exchange business which is to

be regarded as one of the natural foundations of modern finance. Out

of it developed banks of exchange, in which silver (or gold) serves as

world money — now called bank money or commercial money — as

distinct from currency. Exchange transactions, in the sense of mere

notes of payment to travellers from a money changer in one country to

a changer in another country, developed back in Rome and Greece

out of the actual money-changing [...]

    National  money  discards  its  local  character  in  the  capacity  of

universal money; one national currency is expressed in another, and

thus all of them are finally reduced to their content of gold or silver,

while the latter, being the two commodities circulating as world money,

are  simultaneously  reduced  to  their  reciprocal  value-ratio,  which

changes continually. It is this intermediate operation which the money

trader makes his special occupation. Money-changing and the bullion

trade are thus the original forms of the money trade, and spring from

the  two-fold  functions  of  money  —  as  national  money  and  world

money.

    The capitalist process of production, just as commerce in general,

even under pre-capitalist methods, imply:

    First, the accumulation of money as a hoard, i.e., here as that part

of capital which must always be on hand in the form of money as a

reserve fund of means of payment and purchase. This is the first form

of a hoard, as it reappears under the capitalist mode of production,

and  as  it  appears  generally  with  the  development  of  merchant’s

capital, at least for the purposes of this capital. Both remarks apply to

national,  as  well  as  international,  circulation.  The  hoard  is  in

continuous  flux,  pours  ceaselessly  into  circulation,  and  returns

ceaselessly  from  it.  The  second  form  of  a  hoard  is  that  of  idle,

temporarily  unemployed  capital  in  the  shape  of  money,  including

newly accumulated and not yet invested money capital. The functions

entailed  by  this  formation  of  a  hoard  are  primarily  those  of

safekeeping, bookkeeping, etc.

    Secondly, however, this involves outlays of money for purchases,

collecting  money  from  sales,  making  and  receiving  payments,

balancing  payments,  etc.  The  money  dealer  performs  all  theseservices at first as a simple cashier of the merchants and industrial

capitalists.

    The money trade becomes fully developed, even in its first stages,

as soon as its ordinary functions are supplemented by lending and

borrowing and by credit. Of this more in the next part, which deals with

interest-bearing capital [...]

    In  discussing  money  and  the  way  its  movements  and  forms

develop out of simple commodity circulation, we saw (Buch I, Kap. III)

that the movements of the mass of money circulating as means of

purchase  and  payment  depend  on  the  metamorphosis  of

commodities, on the volume and velocity of this metamorphosis, which

we now know to be but a phase in the entire process of reproduction.

As for securing the money materials — gold and silver — from their

sources of production, this resolves itself into a direct exchange of

commodities, an exchange of gold and silver as commodities for other

commodities. Hence, it is itself as much a phase of the exchange of

commodities as the securing of iron or other metals. However, so far

as the movement of precious metals on the world market is concerned

(we here leave aside movements expressing the transfer of capital by

loans  —  a  type  of  transfer  which  also  obtains  in  the  shape  of

commodity capital), it is quite as much determined by the international

exchange of commodities as the movement of money as a national

means of purchase and payment is determined by the exchange of

commodities in the home market. The inflow and outflow of precious

metals from one national sphere of circulation to another, inasmuch as

this is caused merely by a depreciation of the national currency, or by

a double standard, are alien to money circulation as such and merely

represent corrections of deviations brought about arbitrarily by state

decrees.  Finally,  as  concerns  the  formations  of  hoards  which

constitute reserve funds for means of purchase and payment, be it for

home  or  foreign  trade,  and  which  also  merely  represent  a  form  of

temporarily idle capital, they are in both cases necessary precipitates

of the circulation process.

    If the entire circulation of money is in volume, form and movement

purely a result of commodity circulation, which, in its turn, from the

capitalist point of view, is only the circulation process of capital (also

embracing the exchange of capital for revenue, and of revenue forrevenue, so far as outlay of revenue is effected through retail trade), it

is  self-evident  that  dealing  in  money  does  not  merely  promote  the

circulation of money, a mere result and phenomenon of commodity

circulation.  This  circulation  of  money  itself,  a  phase  in  commodity

circulation,  is  taken  for  granted  in  money-dealing.  What  the  latter

promotes  is  merely  the  technical  operations  of  money  circulation

which it concentrates, shortens, and simplifies. Dealing in money does

not  form  the  hoards.  It  provides  the  technical  means  by  which  the

formation  of  hoards  may,  so  far  as  it  is  voluntary  (hence,  not  an

expression  of  unemployed  capital  or  of  disturbances  in  the

reproduction process), be reduced to its economic minimum because,

if managed for the capitalist class as a whole, the reserve funds of

means of purchase and payment need not be as large as they would

have to be if each capitalist were to manage his own [...]

      Money-dealing in its pure form, which we consider here, i.e., set

apart  from  the  credit  system,  is  thus  concerned  only  with  the

technique of a certain phase of commodity circulation, namely, that of

money circulation and the different functions of money arising in its

circulation.

    This substantially distinguishes dealing in money from the dealing

in commodities, which promotes the metamorphosis of commodities

and  their  exchange,  or  even  gives  this  process  of  the  commodity

capital  the  appearance  of  a  process  of  a  capital  set  apart  from

industrial capital. While, therefore, commercial capital has its own form

of circulation, M — C — M, in which the commodity changes hands

twice and thus provide a reflux of money, as distinct from C — M — C,

in which money changes hands twice and thus promotes commodity

exchange, there is no such special form in the case of money-dealing

capital.

    In so far as money capital is advanced by a separate class of

capitalists in this technical promotion of money circulation — a capital

which  on  a  reduced  scale  represents  the  additional  capital  the

merchants and industrial capitalists would otherwise have to advance

themselves for these purposes — the general form of capital, M — M’,

occurs here as well. By advancing M, the advancing capitalist secures

M + AM. But promotion of M — M’ does not here concern the material,

but only the technical, processes of the metamorphosis.    It is evident that the mass of money capital with which the money

dealers  operate  is  the  money  capital  of  merchants  and  industrial

capitalists in the process of circulation, and that the money dealers’

operations  are  actually  operations  of  merchants  and  industrial

capitalists, in which they act as middlemen.

    It is equally evident that the money dealers’ profit is nothing but a

deduction  from  the  surplus  value,  since  they  operate  with  already

realized values [...]          Chapter 20: Historical Facts About Merchants Capital



    [...] Hitherto we have considered merchant’s capital merely from

the  standpoint,  and  within  the  limits,  of  the  capitalist  mode  of

production.  However,  not  commerce  alone,  but  also  merchant's

capital,  is  older  than  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  is,  in  fact,

historically the oldest free state of existence of capital.

    Since merchant’s capital is penned in the sphere of circulation,

and since its function consists exclusively of promoting the exchange

of  commodities,  it  requires  no  other  conditions  for  its  existence  —

aside from the undeveloped forms arising from direct barter — outside

those necessary for the simple circulation of commodities and money.

Or rather, the latter is the condition of its existence. No matter what

the  basis  on  which  products  are  produced,  which  are  thrown  into

circulation  as  commodities  —  whether  the  basis  of  the  primitive

community, of slave production, of small peasant and petty bourgeois,

or the capitalist basis, the character of products as commodities is not

altered, and as commodities they must pass through the process of

exchange and its attendant changes of form [...]

    The  extent  to  which  products  enter  trade  and  go  through  the

merchants’ hands depends on the mode of production, and reaches

its  maximum  in  the  ultimate  development  of  capitalist  production,

where the product is produced solely as a commodity, and not as a

direct means of subsistence. On the other hand, on the basis of every

mode of production, trade facilitates the production of surplus products

destined  for  exchange,  in  order  to  increase  the  enjoyments,  or  the

wealth, of the producers (here meant are the owners of the products).

Hence,  commerce  imparts  to  production  a  character  directed  more

and more towards exchange value.

    The metamorphosis of commodities, their movement, consists 1)

materially, of the exchange of different commodities for one another,

and 2) formally, of the conversion of commodities into money by sale,

and  of  money  into  commodities  by  purchase.  And  the  function  ofmerchant’s capital resolves itself into these very acts of buying and

selling  commodities.  It  therefore  merely  promotes  the  exchange  of

commodities; yet this exchange is not to be conceived at the outset as

a bare exchange of commodities between direct producers [...]

    But whatever the social organization of the spheres of production

whose commodity exchange the merchant promotes, his wealth exists

always in the form of money, and his money always serves as capital.

Its  form  is  always  M  —  C  —  M’.  Money,  the  independent  form  of

exchange  value,  is  the  point  of  departure,  and  increasing  the

exchange value an end in itself [...]

    The less developed the production, the more wealth in money is

concentrated  in  the  hands  of  merchants  or  appears  in  the  specific

form of merchants’ wealth.

    Within the capitalist mode of production — i.e., as soon as capital

has established its sway over production and imparted to it a wholly

changed and specific form — merchant’s capital appears merely as a

capital with a specific function. In all previous modes of production,

and  all  the  more,  wherever  production  ministers  to  the  immediate

wants  of  the  producer,  merchant’s  capital  appears  to  perform  the

function par excellence of capital.

    There is, therefore, not the least difficulty in understanding why

merchant’s capital appears as the historical form of capital long before

capital established its own domination over production. Its existence

and  development  to  a  certain  level  are  in  themselves  historical

premises for the development of capitalist production 1) as premises

for the concentration of money wealth, and 2) because the capitalist

mode  of  production  presupposes  production  for  trade,  selling  on  a

large scale, and not to the individual customer, hence also a merchant

who does not buy to satisfy his personal wants but concentrates the

purchases of many buyers in his one purchase. On the other hand, all

development of merchant’s capital tends to give production more and

more  the  character  of  production  for  exchange  value  and  to  turn

products more and more into commodities. Yet its development, as we

shall presently see, is incapable by itself of promoting and explaining

the transition from one mode of production to another.

    Within capitalist production merchant’s capital is reduced from its

former independent existence to a special phase in the investment ofcapital,  and  the  levelling  of  profits  reduces  its  rate  of  profit  to  the

general average. It functions only as an agent of productive capital.

The special social conditions that take shape with the development of

merchant’s capital, are here no longer paramount. On the contrary,

wherever  merchant’s  capital  still  predominates  we  find  backward

conditions [...]

    The law that the independent development of merchant’s capital

is  inversely  proportional  to  the  degree  of  development  of  capitalist

production is particularly evident in the history of the carrying trade, as

among the Venetians, Genoese, Dutch, etc., where the principal gains

were not thus made by exporting domestic products, but by promoting

the exchange of products of commercially and otherwise economically

undeveloped  societies,  and  by  exploiting  both  producing  countries.

Here,  merchant’s  capital  is  in  its  pure  form,  separated  from  the

extremes — the spheres of production between which it mediates [...]

    In the pre-capitalist stages of society commerce ruled industry. In

modern society the reverse is true. Of course, commerce will have

more or less of a counter effect on the communities between which it

is  carried  on.  It  will  subordinate  production  more  and  more  to

exchange value by making luxuries and subsistence more dependent

on  sale  than  on  the  immediate  use  of  the  products.  Thereby  it

dissolves  the  old  relationships.  It  multiplies  money  circulation.  It

encompasses no longer merely the surplus of production, but bites

deeper  and  deeper  into  the  latter,  and  makes  entire  branches  of

production dependent upon it. Nevertheless, this disintegrating effect

depends very much on the nature of the producing community.

    So long as merchant’s capital promotes the exchange of products

between undeveloped societies, commercial profit not only appears as

out  bargaining  and  cheating,  but  also  largely  originates  from  them.

Aside from the fact that it exploits the difference between the prices of

production of various countries (and in this respect it tends to level

and fix the values of commodities), those modes of production bring it

about that merchant’s capital appropriates an overwhelming portion of

the surplus product partly as a mediator between communities which

still  substantially  produce  for  use  value,  and  for  whose  economic

organization  the  sale  of  the  portion  of  their  product  entering

circulation, or for that matter any sale of products at their value, is ofsecondary importance; and partly, because under those earlier modes

of production the principal owners of the surplus product with whom

the merchant dealt, namely, the slave-owner, the feudal lord, and the

state  (for  instance,  the  oriental  despot)  represent  the  consuming

wealth and luxury which the merchant seeks to trap, as Adam Smith

correctly  scented  in  the  passage  on  feudal  times  quoted  earlier.

Merchant’s  capital,  when  it  holds  a  position  of  dominance,  stands

everywhere for a system of robbery, so that its development among

the  trading  nations  of  old  and  modern  times  is  always  directly

connected  with  plundering,  piracy,  kidnapping  slaves,  and  colonial

conquest;  as  in  Carthage,  Rome,  and  later  among  the  Venetians,

Portuguese, Dutch, etc.

    The development of commerce and merchant’s capital gives rise

everywhere to the tendency towards production of exchange values,

increases  its  volume,  multiplies  it,  makes  it  cosmopolitan,  and

develops money into world money. Commerce, therefore, has a more

or less dissolving influence everywhere on the producing organization,

which it finds at hand and whose different forms are mainly carried on

with a view to use value. To what extent it brings about a dissolution of

the  old  mode  of  production  depends  on  its  solidity  and  internal

structure.  And  whither  this  process  of  dissolution  will  lead,  in  other

words, what new mode of production will replace the old, does not

depend  on  commerce,  but  on  the  character  of  the  old  mode  of

production itself. In the ancient world the effect of commerce and the

development  of  merchant’s  capital  always  resulted  in  a  slave

economy;  depending  on  the  point  of  departure,  only  in  the

transformation of patriarchal slave system devoted to the production of

immediate means of subsistence into one devoted to the production of

surplus value. However, in the modern world, it results in the capitalist

mode of production. It follows therefrom that these results spring in

themselves  from  circumstances  other  than  the  development  of

merchant’s capital.

    It is in the nature of things that as soon as town industry as such

separates from agricultural industry, its products are from the outset

commodities  and  thus  require  the  mediation  of  commerce  for  their

sale. The leaning of commerce towards the development of towns,

and, on the other hand, the dependence of towns upon commerce,are  so  far  natural.  However,  it  depends  on  altogether  different

circumstances to what measure industrial development will go hand in

hand  with  this  development.  Ancient  Rome,  in  its  later  republican

days,  developed  merchant’s  capital  to  a  higher  degree  than  ever

before  in  the  ancient  world,  without  showing  any  progress  in  the

development  of  crafts,  while  in  Corinth  and  other  Grecian  towns  in

Europe  and  Asia  Minor  the  development  of  commerce  was

accompanied  by  highly  developed  crafts.  On  the  other  hand,  quite

contrary to the growth of towns and attendant conditions, the trading

spirit  and  the  development  of  merchant’s  capital  occur  frequently

among unsettled nomadic peoples.

    There is no doubt — and it is precisely this fact which has led to

wholly erroneous conceptions — that in the 16th and 17th centuries

the  great  revolutions,  which  took  place  in  commerce  with  the

geographical discoveries and speeded the development of merchant’s

capital,  constitute  one  of  the  principal  elements  in  furthering  the

transition  from  feudal  to  capitalist  mode  of  production.  The  sudden

expansion  of  the  world  market,  the  multiplication  of  circulating

commodities, the competitive zeal of the European nations to possess

themselves of the products of Asia and the treasures of America, and

the colonial system — all contributed materially toward destroying the

feudal  fetters  on  production.  However,  in  its  first  period  —  the

manufacturing period — the modern mode of production developed

only  where  the  conditions  for  it  had  taken  shape  within  the  Middle

Ages. Compare, for instance, Holland with Portugal. And when in the

16th, and partially still in the 17th, century the sudden expansion of

commerce  and  emergence  of  a  new  world  market  overwhelmingly

contributed to the fall of the old mode of production and the rise of

capitalist production, this was accomplished conversely on the basis

of the already existing capitalist mode of production. The world market

itself forms the basis for this mode of production.

    On  the  other  hand,  the  immanent  necessity  of  this  mode  of

production to produce on an ever-enlarged scale tends to extend the

world market continually, so that it is not commerce in this case which

revolutionizes  industry,  but  industry  which  constantly  revolutionizes

commerce.  Commercial  supremacy  itself  is  now  linked  with  the

prevalence  to  a  greater  or  lesser  degree  of  conditions  for  a  largeindustry. Compare, for instance, England and Holland. The history of

the decline of Holland as the ruling trading nation is the history of the

subordination of merchant’s capital to industrial capital [...]

    The transition from the feudal mode of production is two-fold. The

producer becomes merchant and capitalist, in contrast to the natural

agricultural economy and the guild-bound handicrafts of the medieval

urban industries. This is the really revolutionizing path. Or else, the

merchant establishes direct sway over production. However much this

serves historically as a stepping-stone — witness the English 17th-

century clothier, who brings the weavers, independent as they are,

under his control by selling their wool to them and buying their cloth —

it  cannot  by  itself  contribute  to  the  overthrow  of  the  old  mode  of

production,  but  tends  rather  to  preserve  and  retain  it  as  its

precondition. The manufacturer in the French silk industry and in the

English hosiery and lace industries, for example, was thus mostly but

nominally a manufacturer until the middle of the 19th century. In point

of fact, he was merely a merchant, who let the weavers carry on in

their old unorganized way and exerted only a merchant’s control, for

that  was  for  whom  they  really  worked.  This  system  presents

everywhere an obstacle to the real capitalist mode of production and

goes under with its development. Without revolutionizing the mode of

production, it only worsens the condition of the direct producers, turns

them into mere wage workers and proletarians under conditions worse

than those under the immediate control of capital, and appropriates

their surplus labor on the basis of the old mode of production. The

same  conditions  exist  in  somewhat  modified  form  in  part  of  the

London handicraft furniture industry [...]

    There is, consequently, a three-fold transition. First, the merchant

becomes directly an industrial capitalist. This is true in crafts based on

trade, especially crafts producing luxuries and imported by merchants

together with the raw materials and laborers from foreign lands, as in

Italy from Constantinople in the 15th century. Second, the merchant

turns the small masters into his middlemen, or buys directly from the

independent  producer,  leaving  him  nominally  independent  and  his

mode  of  production  unchanged.  Third,  the  industrialist  becomes

merchant and produces directly for the wholesale market [...]    The first theoretical treatment of the modern mode of production

—  the  mercantile  system  —  proceeded  necessarily  from  the

superficial phenomena of the circulation process as individualized in

the movements of merchant’s capital, and therefore grasped only the

appearance of matters. Partly because merchant’s capital is the first

free state of existence of capital in general. And partly because of the

overwhelming influence which it exerted during the first revolutionizing

period of feudal production — the genesis of modern production. The

real  science  of  modern  economy  only  begins  when  the  theoretical

analysis  passes  from  the  process  of  circulation  to  the  process  of

production. Interest-bearing capital is, indeed, likewise a very old form

of capital. But we shall see later why mercantilism does not take it as

its point of departure, but rather carries on a polemic against it.      PART 5: DIVISION OF PROFIT INTO INTEREST AND

PROFIT OF ENTERPRISE. INTEREST-BEARING CAPITAL                      Chapter 21: Interest-Bearing Capital



    In  our  first  discussion  of  the  general,  or  average,  rate  of  profit

(Part II of this book) we did not have this rate before us in its complete

form, the equalization of profit appearing only as equalization between

industrial  capitals  invested  in  different  spheres.  This  was

supplemented in the preceding part, which dealt with the participation

of merchant’s capital in this equalization, and also commercial profit.

The  general  rate  of  profit  and  the  average  profit  now  appeared  in

narrower limits than before. It should be remembered in the course of

our analysis that in any future reference to the general rate of profit or

to average profit we mean this latter connotation, hence only the final

form of average rate. And since this rate is the same for mercantile, as

well  as  industrial,  capital,  it  is  no  longer  necessary,  so  far  as  this

average profit is concerned, to make a distinction between industrial

and commercial profit. Whether industrially invested in the sphere of

production, or commercially in the sphere of circulation, capital yields

the same average annual profit pro rata to its magnitude.

    Money — here taken as the independent expression of a certain

amount of value existing either actually as money or as commodities

— may be converted into capital on the basis of capitalist production,

and  may  thereby  be  transformed  from  a  given  value  to  a  self-

expanding, or increasing, value. It produces profit, i.e., it enables the

capitalist to extract a certain quantity of unpaid labor, surplus product

and surplus value from the laborers, and to appropriate it. In this way,

aside from its use value as money, it acquires an additional use value,

namely that of serving as capital. Its use value then consists precisely

in the profit it produces when converted into capital. In this capacity of

potential  capital,  as  a  means  of  producing  profit,  it  becomes  a

commodity,  but  a  commodity  sui  generis.  Or,  what  amounts  to  the

same, capital as capital becomes a commodity.

    Suppose the annual average rate of profit is 20%. In that case a

machine  valued  at  £100,  employed  as  capital  under  average

conditions and an average amount of intelligence and purposive effort,

would yield a profit of £20. A man in possession of £100, therefore,possesses the power to make £120 out of £100, or to produce a profit

of £20. He possesses a potential capital of £100. If he gives these

£100  to  another  for  one  year,  so  the  latter  may  use  them  as  real

capital, he gives him the power to produce a profit of £20 — a surplus

value  which  costs  this  other  nothing,  and  for  which  he  pays  no

equivalent. If this other should pay, say, £5 at the close of the year to

the owner of the £100 out of the profit produced, he would thereby pay

the use value of the £100 — the use value of its function as capital,

the function of producing a profit of £20. The part of the profit paid to

the owner is called interest, which is just another name, or special

term,  for  a  part  of  the  profit  given  up  by  capital  in  the  process  of

functioning to the owner of the capital, instead of putting it into its own

pocket [...]

    Let  us  first  consider  the  singular  circulation  of  interest-bearing

capital. We shall then secondly have to analyses the peculiar manner

in  which  it  is  sold  as  a  commodity,  namely  loaned  instead  of

relinquished once and for all.

    The point of departure is the money which A advances to B [...] In

B’s possession the money is actually converted into capital, passes

through M — C — M’ and returns to A as M’, as M+AM, where AM

represents the interest [...] The movement, therefore, is M — M — C

— M’ — M’. What appears duplicated here, is 1) the outlay of money

as capital, and 2) its reflux as realized capital, as M’ or M+AM.

 [... In] interest-bearing capital the first time M changes hands is

by no means a phase either of the commodity metamorphosis, or of

reproduction of capital. It first becomes one when it is expended a

second time, in the hands of the active capitalist who carries on trade

with  it,  or  transforms  it  into  productive  capital.  M’s  first  change  of

hands does not express anything here, beyond its transfer from A to B

— a transfer which usually takes place under certain legal forms and

stipulations.

    This double outlay of money as capital, of which the first is merely

a transfer from A to B, is matched by its double reflux. As M’, or M +

AM,  it  flows  back  out  of  the  process  to  B,  the  person  acting  as

capitalist. The latter then transfers it back to A, but together with a part

of the profit, as realized capital, as M + AM, in which AM is not the

entire profit, but only a portion of the profit — the interest. It flows backto B only as what he had expended, as functioning capital, but as the

property  of  A.  To  make  its  reflux  complete,  B  must  consequently

return it to A. But in addition to the capital, B must also turn over to A a

portion of the profit, a part which goes under the name of interest,

which he had made with this capital since A had given him the money

only  as  a  capital,  i.e.,  as  value  which  is  not  only  preserved  in  its

movement, but also creates surplus value for its owner. It remains in

B’s hands only so long as it is functioning capital. And with its reflux —

on the stipulated date — it ceases to function as capital. When no

longer acting as capital, however, it must again be returned to A, who

had never ceased being its legal owner [...]

    The first expenditure, which transfers the capital from the lender

to the borrower, is a legal transaction which has nothing to do with the

actual process of reproduction. It is merely a prelude to this process.

The return payment, which again transfers the capital that has flowed

back from the borrower to the lender is another legal transaction, a

supplement of the first. One introduces the actual process, the other is

an act supplementary to this process. Point of departure and point of

return, the giving away and the recovery of the loaned capital, thus

appear as arbitrary movements promoted by legal transactions, which

take place before and after the actual movement of capital and have

nothing  to  do  with  it  as  such.  It  would  have  been  all  the  same  as

concerns  this  actual  movement  if  the  capital  had  from  the  first

belonged to the industrial capitalist and had returned to him, therefore,

as his own [...]

    We have so far only considered the movements of loaned capital

between its owner and the industrial capitalist. Now we must inquire

into interest.

    The lender expends his money as capital; the amount of value,

which he relinquishes to another, is capital, and consequently returns

to him. But the mere return of it would not be the reflux of the loaned

sum  of  value  as  capital,  but  merely  the  return  of  a  loaned  sum  of

value. To return as capital, the advanced sum of value must not only

be preserved in the movement but must also expand, must increase in

value, i.e., must return with a surplus value, as M + AM, the latter

being interest or a portion of the average profit, which does not remainin the hands of the operating capitalist, but falls to the share of the

money capitalist [...]

    What is alienated in an ordinary sale? Not the value of the sold

commodity, for this merely changes its form. The value exists ideally

in a commodity as its price before it actually passes as money into the

hands of the seller. The same value and the same amount of value

merely change their form. In the one instance they exist in commodity

form, in the other in the form of money. What is really alienated by the

seller,  and,  therefore,  passes  into  the  individual  or  productive

consumption of the buyer, is the use value of the commodity — the

commodity as a use value.

    What, now, is the use value which the money capitalist gives up

for the period of the loan and relinquishes to the productive capitalist

—  the  borrower?  It  is  the  use  value  which  the  money  acquires  by

being  capable  of  becoming  capital,  of  performing  the  functions  of

capital,  and  creating  a  definite  surplus  value,  the  average  profit

(whatever  is  above  or  below  it  appears  here  as  a  mere  accident)

during its process, besides preserving its original magnitude of value.

In  the  case  of  the  other  commodities  the  use  value  is  ultimately

consumed.  Their  substance  disappears,  and  with  it  their  value.  In

contrast, the commodity capital is peculiar in that its value and use

value not only remain intact but also increase, through consumption of

its use value.

    It is this use value of money as capital — this faculty of producing

an  average  profit  —  which  the  money  capitalist  relinquishes  to  the

industrial capitalist for the period, during which he places the loaned

capital at the latter's disposal.

    Money  thus  loaned  has  in  this  respect  a  certain  similarity  with

labor  power  in  its  relation  to  the  industrial  capitalist.  With  the

difference that the latter pays for the value of labor power, whereas he

simply pays back the value of the loaned capital. The use value of

labor  power  for  the  industrial  capitalist  is  that  labor  power  creates

more value (profit) in its consumption than it possesses itself, and then

it costs. This additional value is use value for the industrial capitalist.

And  in  like  manner  the  use  value  of  loaned  capital  appears  as  its

faculty  of  begetting  and  increasing  value  [...]  The  use  value  of  theloaned money lies in its being able to serve as capital and, as such, to

produce the average profit under average conditions [...]

    What the buyer of an ordinary commodity buys is its use value;

what he pays for is its value. What the borrower of money buys is

likewise its use value as capital; but what does he pay for? Surely not

its price, or value, as in the case of ordinary commodities. No change

of form occurs in the value passing between borrower and lender, as

occurs between buyer and seller when it exists in one instance in the

form  of  money,  and  in  another  in  the  form  of  a  commodity.  The

sameness of the alienated and returned value is revealed here in an

entirely different way. The sum of value, i.e., the money, is given away

without  an  equivalent,  and  is  returned  after  a  certain  period.  The

lender  always  remains  the  owner  of  the  same  value,  even  after  it

passes  from  his  hands  into  those  of  the  borrower.  In  an  ordinary

exchange of commodities money always comes from the buyer's side;

but in a loan it comes from the side of the seller. He is the one who

gives away money for a certain period, and the buyer of capital is the

one who receives it as a commodity. But this is only possible as long

as the money acts as capital and is therefore advanced. The borrower

borrows money as capital, as a value producing more value. But at the

moment when it is advanced it is still only potential capital, like any

other capital at its starting-point, the moment it is advanced.

    It  is  only  through  its  employment  that  it  expands  its  value  and

realizes  itself  as  capital.  However,  it  has  to  be  returned  by  the

borrower  as  realized  capital,  hence  as  value  plus  surplus  value

(interest). And the latter can only be a portion of the realized profit.

Only a portion, not all of it. For the use value of the loaned capital to

the  borrower  consists  in  producing  profit  for  him.  Otherwise  there

would not have been any alienation of use value on the lender’s part.

On the other hand, not all the profit can fall to the borrower’s share.

Otherwise  he  would  pay  nothing  for  the  alienated  use  value,  and

would return the advanced money to the lender as ordinary money,

not as capital, as realized capital, for it is realized capital only as M +

AM.

    Both  of  them,  lender  and  borrower,  expend  the  same  sum  of

money as capital. But it is only in the hands of the latter that it serves

as capital. The profit is not doubled by the double existence of thesame sum of money as capital for two persons. It can serve as capital

for both of them only by dividing the profit. The portion which falls to

the lender is called interest.

    The  entire  transaction,  as  assumed,  takes  place  between  two

kinds  of  capitalists  —  the  money  capitalist  and  the  industrial  or

merchant capitalist [...]

    Furthermore, capital appears as a commodity, inasmuch as the

division of profit into interest and profit proper is regulated by supply

and  demand,  that  is,  by  competition,  just  as  the  market  prices  of

commodities.  But  the  difference  here  is  just  as  apparent  as  the

analogy.  If  supply  and  demand  coincide,  the  market  price  of

commodities corresponds to their price of production, i.e., their price

then  appears  to  be  regulated  by  the  immanent  laws  of  capitalist

production,  independently  of  competition,  since  the  fluctuations  of

supply and demand explain nothing but deviations of market prices

from  prices  of  production.  These  deviations  mutually  balance  one

another, so that in the course of certain longer periods the average

market prices equal the prices of production. As soon as supply and

demand coincide, these forces cease to operate, i.e., compensate one

another, and the general law determining prices then also comes to

apply to individual cases.

    The market price then corresponds even in its immediate form,

and not only as the average of market price movements, to the price

of production, which is regulated by the immanent laws of the mode of

production itself. The same applies to wages. If supply and demand

coincide,  they  neutralize  each  other's  effect,  and  wages  equal  the

value  of  labor  power.  But  it  is  different  with  the  interest  on  money

capital. Competition does not, in this case, determine the deviations

from the rule. There is rather no law of division except that enforced

by competition, because, as we shall later see, no such thing as a

"natural" rate of interest exists. By the natural rate of interest people

merely mean the rate fixed by free competition. There are no "natural"

limits for the rate of interest. Whenever competition does not merely

determine  the  deviations  and  fluctuations,  whenever,  therefore,  the

neutralization  of  opposing  forces  puts  a  stop  to  any  and  all

determination,  the  thing  to  be  determined  becomes  something

arbitrary and lawless. More on this in the next Chapter [...]    With his usual insight into the internal connection of things, the

romantic Adam Müller says (Elemente der Staatskunst, Berlin, 1809,

Dritter Theil, S. 138);

    "In determining the prices of things, time is not considered; while

in determining interest, time is the principal factor".

    He  does  not  see  how  the  time  of  production  and  the  time  of

circulation enter into the determination of commodity prices, and how

this  is  just  what  determines  the  rate  of  profit  for  a  given  period  of

turnover of capital, whereas interest is determined by precisely this

determination  of  profit  for  a  given  period.  His  sagacity  here,  as

elsewhere, consists in observing the clouds of dust on the surface and

presumptuously declaring this dust to be something mysterious and

important.    Chapter 22: Division of Profit. Rate of Interest. "Natural" Rate

                                      of Interest



    The subject of this Chapter, like all the other phenomena of credit

we shall come across later on, cannot be analyzed here in detail. The

competition between lenders and borrowers and the resultant minor

fluctuations of the money market fall outside the scope of our inquiry.

The circuit described by the rate of interest during the industrial cycle

requires for its presentation the analysis of this cycle itself, but this

likewise  cannot  be  given  here.  The  same  applies  to  the  greater  or

lesser  approximate  equalization  of  the  rate  of  interest  in  the  world

market. We are here concerned with the independent form of interest-

bearing capital and the individualization of interest, as distinct from

profit.

    Since  interest  is  merely  a  part  of  profit  paid,  according  to  our

earlier assumption, by the industrial capitalist to the money capitalist,

the  maximum  limit  of  interest  is  the  profit  itself,  in  which  case  the

portion pocketed by the productive capitalist would = 0. Aside from

exceptional  cases,  in  which  interest  might  actually  be  larger  than

profit, but then could not be paid out of the profit, one might consider

as the maximum limit of interest the total profit minus the portion (to be

subsequently  analyzed)  which  resolves  itself  into  wages  of

superintendence.  The  minimum  limit  of  interest  is  altogether

indeterminable. It may fall to any low. Yet in that case there will always

be  counteracting  influences  to  raise  it  again  above  this  relative

minimum [...]

    Let us first assume that there is a fixed relation between the total

profit and that part of it which has to be paid as interest to the money

capitalist. It is then clear that the interest will rise or fall with the total

profit, and the latter is determined by the general rate of profit and its

fluctuations. For instance, if the average rate of profit were = 20% and

the interest = 1/4 of the profit, the rate of interest would = 5%; if the

average rate of profit were = 16%, the rate of interest would = 4%.With the rate of profit at 20%, the rate of interest might rise to 8%, and

the industrial capitalist would still make the same profit as he would at

a rate of profit = 16% and a rate of interest = 4%, namely 12%. Should

interest rise only to 6% or 7%, he would still keep a larger share of the

profit.  If  the  interest  amounted  to  a  constant  quota  of  the  average

profit,  it  would  follow  that  the  higher  the  general  rate  of  profit,  the

greater  the  absolute  difference  between  the  total  profit  and  the

interest, and the greater the portion of the total profit pocketed by the

productive capitalist, and vice versa. Take it that interest = 1/5 of the

average profit. One-fifth of 10 is 2; the difference between total profit

and interest = 8. One-fifth of 20 = 4; difference = 20 - 4 = 16; 1/5 of 25

= 5; difference = 25 - 5 = 20; 1/5 of 30 = 6; difference = 30 - 6 = 24;

1/5 of 35 = 7; difference = 35 - 7 = 28. The different rates of interest of

4, 5, 6, 7% would here always represent no more than 1/5, or 20% of

the total profit. If the rates of profit are different, therefore, different

rates  of  interest  may  represent  the  same  aliquot  parts  of  the  total

profit, or the same percentage of the total profit. With such constant

proportions of interest, the industrial profit (the difference between the

total profit and the interest) would rise proportionately to the general

rate of profit, and conversely.

    All other conditions taken as equal, i.e., assuming the proportion

between  interest  and  total  profit  to  be  more  or  less  constant,  the

functioning  capitalist  is  able  and  willing  to  pay  a  higher  or  lower

interest directly proportional to the level of the rate of profit.

    Since we have seen that the rate of profit is inversely proportional

to the development of capitalist production, it follows that the higher or

lower rate of interest in a country is in the same inverse proportion to

the  degree  of  industrial  development,  at  least  in  so  far  as  the

difference in the rate of interest actually expresses the difference in

the rates of profit. It shall later develop that this need not always be

the case. In this sense it may be said that interest is regulated through

profit, or, more precisely, the general rate of profit. And this mode of

regulating interest applies even to its average.

    In any event the average rate of profit is to be regarded as the

ultimate determinant of the maximum limit of interest.

    The  fact  that  interest  is  to  be  related  to  average  profit  will  be

considered presently at greater length. Whenever a specified entity,such  as  profit,  is  to  be  divided  between  two  parties,  the  matter

naturally hinges above all on the magnitude of the entity which is to be

divided,  and  this,  the  magnitude  of  the  profit,  is  determined  by  its

average rate. Suppose the general rate of profit, hence the magnitude

of profit, for a capital of given size, say, = 100, is assumed as given.

Then the variations of interest will obviously be inversely proportional

to those of the part of profit remaining in the hands of the producing

capitalist,  working  with  a  borrowed  capital.  And  the  circumstances

determining  the  amount  of  profit  to  be  distributed,  of  the  value

produced by unpaid labor, differ widely from those which determine its

distribution  between  these  two  kinds  of  capitalists,  and  frequently

produce entirely opposite effects.

    If we observe the cycles in which modern industry moves — state

of  inactivity,  mounting  revival,  prosperity,  overproduction,  crisis,

stagnation, state of inactivity, etc., which fall beyond the scope of our

analysis  —  we  shall  find  that  a  low  rate  of  interest  generally

corresponds to periods of prosperity or extra profit, a rise in interest

separates prosperity and its reverse, and a maximum of interest up to

a  point  of  extreme  usury  corresponds  to  the  period  of  crisis.  The

summer of 1843 ushered in a period of remarkable prosperity; the rate

of interest, still 4% in the spring of 1842, fell to 2% in the spring and
                    1/2

summer of 1843; in September it fell as low as 1% (Gilbart, I, p.
                                                                    1/2

166); whereupon it rose to 8% and higher during the crisis of 1847.

    It  is  possible,  however,  for  low  interest  to  go  along  with

stagnation, and for moderately rising interest to go along with revived

activity.

    The rate of interest reaches its peak during crises, when money is

borrowed  at  any  cost  to  meet  payments.  Since  a  rise  in  interest

implies a fall in the price of securities, this simultaneously offers a fine

opportunity  to  people  with  available  money  capital,  to  acquire  at

ridiculously low prices such interest-bearing securities as must, in the

course of things, at least regain their average price as soon as the

rate of interest falls again.

    However,  the  rate  of  interest  also  has  a  tendency  to  fall  quite

independently of the fluctuations in the rate of profit. And, indeed, due

to two main causes:    I. "Were we even to suppose that capital was never borrowed with

any view but to productive employment, I think it very possible that

interest might vary without any change in the rate of gross profits. For,

as a nation advances in the career of wealth, a class of men springs

up and increases more and more, who by the labors of their ancestors

find themselves in the possession of funds sufficiently ample to afford

a  handsome  maintenance  from  the  interest  alone.  Very  many  also

who during youth and middle age were actively engaged in business,

retire in their latter days' to live quietly on the interest of the sums they

have themselves accumulated. This class, as well as the former, has

a tendency to increase with the increasing riches of the country, for

those  who  begin  with  a  tolerable  stock  are  likely  to  make  an

independence  sooner  than  they  who  commence  with  little.  Thus  it

comes to pass, that in old and rich countries, the amount of national

capital  belonging  to  those  who  are  unwilling  to  take  the  trouble  of

employing  it  themselves,  bears  a  larger  proportion  to  the  whole

productive  stock  of  the  society,  than  in  newly  settled  and  poorer

districts. How much more numerous in proportion to the population is

the class of rentiers ... in England! As the class of rentiers increases,

so also does that of lenders of capital, for they are one and the same".

    II. The development of the credit system and the attendant ever-

growing  control  of  industrialists  and  merchants  over  the  money

savings of all classes of society that is effected through the bankers,

and the progressive concentration of these savings in amounts which

can serve as money capital, must also depress the rate of interest.

More about this later [...]

    To determine the average rate of interest we must 1) calculate the

average  rate  of  interest  during  its  variations  in  the  major  industrial

cycles; and 2) find the rate of interest for investments which require

long-term loans of capital.

    The average rate of interest prevailing in a certain country — as

distinct  from  the  continually  fluctuating  market  rates  —  cannot  be

determined  by  any  law.  In  this  sphere  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a

natural rate of interest in the sense in which economists speak of a

natural rate of profit and a natural rate of wages [...]    Equating  supply  and  demand  —  assuming  the  average  rate  of

profit  as  given  —  means  nothing.  Wherever  else  this  formula  is

resorted to (and this is then practically correct), it serves as a formula

to  find  the  fundamental  rule  (the  regulating  limits  or  limiting

magnitudes)  which  is  independent  of,  and  rather  determines,

competition; notably as a formula for those who are held captive by

the  practice  of  competition,  and  by  its  phenomena  and  the

conceptions  arising  out  of  them,  to  arrive  at  what  is  again  but  a

superficial idea of the inner connection of economic relations obtaining

within competition. It is a method to pass from the variations that go

with competition to the limits of these variations. This is not the case

with  the  average  rate  of  interest.  There  is  no  good  reason  why

average conditions of competition, the balance between lender and

borrower, should give the lender an interest rate of 3, 4, 5%, etc., or

else a certain percentage of the gross profits, say 20% or 50%, on his

capital. Wherever it is competition as such which determines anything,

the determination is accidental, purely empirical, and only pedantry or

fantasy would seek to represent this accident as a necessity. Nothing

is  more  amusing  in  the  reports  of  Parliament  for  1857  and  1858

concerning bank legislation and commercial crises than to hear of "the

real rate produced" as the directors of the Bank of England, London

bankers, country bankers, and professional theorists chatter back and

forth, never getting beyond such commonplaces as that "the price paid

for the use of loanable capital should vary with the supply of such

capital," that "a high rate and a low profit cannot permanently exist,"

and similar specious platitudes.

    Customs,  juristic  tradition,  etc.,  have  as  much  to  do  with

determining the average rate of interest as competition itself, in so far

as it exists not merely as an average, but rather as actual magnitude.

In many law disputes, where interest has to be calculated, an average

rate  of  interest  has  to  be  assumed  as  the  legal  rate.  If  we  inquire

further  as  to  why  the  limits  of  a  mean  rate  of  interest  cannot  be

deduced  from  general  laws,  we  find  the  answer  lies  simply  in  the

nature of interest. It is merely a part of the average profit. The same

capital  appears  in  two  roles  —  as  loanable  capital  in  the  lender’s

hands and as industrial, or commercial, capital in the hands of the

functioning capitalist. But it functions just once, and produces profitjust  once.  In  the  production  process  itself  the  nature  of  capital  as

loanable capital plays no role. How the two parties who have claim to

it divide the profit is in itself just as purely empirical a matter belonging

to the realm of accident as the distribution of percentage shares of a

common  profit  in  a  business  partnership.  Two  entirely  different

elements  —  labor  power  and  capital  —  act  as  determinants  in  the

division between surplus value and wages, which division essentially

determines the rate of profit; these are functions of two independent

variables, which limit one another; and it is their qualitative difference

that is the source of the quantitative division of the produced value.

We shall see later that the same occurs in the splitting of surplus value

into rent and profit. Nothing of the kind occurs in the case of interest.

Here the qualitative differentiation as we shall presently see, proceeds

rather from the purely quantitative division of the same sum of surplus

value.

    It  follows  from  the  aforesaid  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a

"natural" rate of interest. But if, unlike the general rate of profit, there is

on the one hand no general law to determine the limits of the average

interest,  or  average  rate  of  interest  as  distinct  from  the  continually

fluctuating market rates of interest, because it is merely a question of

dividing the gross profit between two owners of capital under different

title; on the other hand, the rate of interest — be it the average or the

market rate prevalent in each particular case — appears as a uniform,

definite  and  tangible  magnitude  in  a  quite  different  way  from  the

general rate of profit.

    The rate of interest is similarly related to the rate of profit as the

market price of a commodity is to its value. In so far as the rate of

interest is determined by the rate of profit, this is always the general

rate  of  profit  and  not  any  specific  rate  of  profit  prevailing  in  some

particular branch of industry, and still less any extra profit which an

individual capitalist may make in a particular sphere of business. It is a

fact, therefore, that the general rate of profit appears as an empirical,

given reality in the average rate of interest, although the latter is not a

pure or reliable expression of the former [...]

    As  concerns  the  perpetually  fluctuating  market  rate  of  interest,

however, it exists at any moment as a fixed magnitude, just as the

market  price  of  commodities,  because  in  the  money  market  allloanable capital continually faces functioning capital as an aggregate

mass, so that the relation between the supply of loanable capital on

one side, and the demand for it on the other, decides the market level

of interest at any given time. This is all the more so, the more the

development,  and  the  attendant  concentration,  of  the  credit  system

gives to loanable capital a general social character and throws it all at

once on the money market. On the other hand, the general rate of

profit is never anything more than a tendency, a movement to equalize

specific rates of profit. The competition between capitalists — which is

itself  this  movement  toward  equilibrium  —  consists  here  of  their

gradually  withdrawing  capital  from  spheres  in  which  profit  is  for  an

appreciable  length  of  time  below  average,  and  gradually  investing

capital into spheres in which profit is above average. Or it may also

consist in additional capital distributing itself gradually and in varying

proportions among these spheres. It is continual variation in supply

and  withdrawal  of  capital  in  regard  to  these  different  spheres,  and

never a simultaneous mass effect, as in the determination of the rate

of interest [...]

    In emphasizing this difference between the rate of interest and the

rate  of  profit,  we  still  omit  the  following  two  points,  which  favor

consolidation of the rate of interest: 1) the historical pre-existence of

interest-bearing capital and the existence of a traditional general rate

of  interest;  2)  the  far  greater  direct  influence  exerted  by  the  world

market  on  establishing  the  rate  of  interest,  irrespective  of  the

economic conditions of a country, as compared with its influence on

the rate of profit.

    The average profit does not obtain as a directly established fact,

but rather is to be determined as an end result of the equalization of

opposite fluctuations. Not so with the rate of interest. It is a thing fixed

daily  in  its  general,  at  least  local,  validity  —  a  thing  which  serves

industrial and mercantile capitals even as a prerequisite and a factor

in  the  calculation  of  their  operation.  It  becomes  the  general

endowment of every sum of money of £100 to yield £2, 3, 4, 5 [...]

    [...  The]  rate  of  interest  is  regularly  reported  as  "the  price  of

money”. It is so, because capital itself is being offered here in the form

of money as a commodity. The fixation of its price is thus a fixation of

its market price, as with all other commodities. The rate of interest,therefore, always appears as the general rate of interest, as so much

money for so much money, as a definite quantity [...]                  Chapter 23: Interest and Profit of Enterprise



    Interest, as we have seen in the two preceding Chapters, appears

originally,  is  originally,  and  remains  in  fact  merely  a  portion  of  the

profit,  i.e.,  of  the  surplus  value,  which  the  functioning  capitalist,

industrialist or merchant has to pay to the owner and lender of money

capital  whenever  he  uses  loaned  capital  instead  of  his  own.  If  he

employs only his own capital, no such division of profit takes place;

the latter is then entirely his. Indeed, as long as the owners of the

capital employ it on their own in the reproduction process, they do not

compete in determining the rate of interest. This alone shows that the

category  of  interest  —  impossible  without  determining  the  rate  of

interest — is alien to the movements of industrial capital as such [...]

    It is indeed only the separation of capitalists into money capitalists

and  industrial  capitalists  that  transforms  a  portion  of  the  profit  into

interest, that generally creates the category of interest; and it is only

the competition between these two kinds of capitalists which creates

the rate of interest [...]

    [We] must dwell somewhat longer on the actual point of departure

in  the  formation  of  interest;  that  is,  we  must  proceed  from  the

assumption  that  the  money  capitalist  and  industrial  capitalist  really

confront  one  another  not  just  as  legally  different  persons,  but  as

persons playing entirely different roles in the reproduction process, or

as persons in whose hands the same capital really performs a two-fold

and  wholly  different  movement.  The  one  merely  loans  it,  the  other

employs it productively.

    For the productive capitalist who works on borrowed capital, the

gross profit falls into two parts — the interest, which he is to pay the

lender, and the surplus over and above the interest, which makes up

his own share of the profit. If the general rate of profit is given, this

latter portion is determined by the rate of interest; and if the rate of

interest is given, then by the general rate of profit. And furthermore:

however,  the  gross  profit,  the  actual  value  of  the  total  profit,  maydiverge in each individual case from the average profit, the portion

belonging to the functioning capitalist is determined by the interest,

since this is fixed by the general rate of interest (leaving aside any

special  legal  stipulations)  and  assumed  to  be  given  beforehand,

before the process of production begins, hence before its result, the

gross  profit,  is  achieved.  We  have  seen  that  the  actual  specific

product of capital is surplus value, or, more precisely, profit. But for

the  capitalist  working  on  borrowed  capital  it  is  not  profit,  but  profit

minus interest, that portion of profit which remains to him after paying

interest. This portion of the profit, therefore, necessarily appears to

him to be the product of a capital as long as it is operative; and this it

is, as far as he is concerned, because he represents capital only as

functioning capital. He is its personification as long as it functions, and

it functions as long as it is profitably invested in industry or commerce

and such operations are undertaken with it through its employer as

are prescribed by the branch of industry concerned.

    As distinct from interest, which he has to pay to the lender out of

the gross profit, the portion of profit which falls to his share necessarily

assumes  the  form  of  industrial  or  commercial  profit,  or,  to  use  a

German term embracing both, the form of Unternehmergewinn (profit

of enterprise). If the gross profit equals the average profit, the size of

the profit of enterprise is determined exclusively by the rate of interest.

If the gross profit deviates from the average profit, its difference from

the average profit (after interest is deducted from both) is determined

by all the circumstances which cause a temporary deviation, be it of

the rate of profit in any particular sphere from the general rate of profit,

or the profit of some individual capitalist in a certain sphere from the

average profit of this sphere. We have seen however that the rate of

profit within the production process itself does not depend on surplus

value alone, but also on many other circumstances, such as purchase

prices  of  means  of  production,  methods  more  productive  than  the

average, on savings of constant capital, etc. And aside from the price

of  production,  it  depends  on  special  circumstances,  and  in  every

single business transaction on the greater or lesser shrewdness and

industry of the capitalist, whether, and to what extent, he buys or sells

above or below the price of production and thus appropriates a greater

or  smaller  portion  of  the  total  surplus  value  in  the  process  ofcirculation.  In  any  case,  the  quantitative  division  of  the  gross  profit

turns  here  into  a  qualitative  one,  and  all  the  more  so  because  the

quantitative  division  itself  depends  on  what  is  to  be  divided,  the

manner in which the active capitalist manages his capital, and what

gross  profit  it  yields  to  him  as  a  functioning  capital,  i.e.,  in

consequence of his functions as an active capitalist. The functioning

capitalist is here assumed as a non-owner of capital. Ownership of the

capital is represented in relation to him by the money capitalist, the

lender.

    The interest he pays to the latter thus appears as that portion of

gross  profit  which  is  due  to  the  ownership  of  capital  as  such.  As

distinct from this, that portion of profit which falls to the active capitalist

appears  now  as  profit  of  enterprise,  deriving  solely  from  the

operations,  or  functions,  which  he  performs  with  the  capital  in  the

process of reproduction, hence particularly those functions which he

performs as entrepreneur in industry or commerce. In relation to him

interest  appears  therefore  as  the  mere  fruit  of  owning  capital,  of

capital as such abstracted from the reproduction process of capital,

inasmuch  as  it  does  not  "work",  does  not  function;  while  profit  of

enterprise appears to him as the exclusive fruit of the functions which

he  performs  with  the  capital,  as  the  fruit  of  the  movement  and

performance of capital, of a performance which appears to him as his

own activity, as opposed to the inactivity, the non-participation of the

money capitalist in the production process. This qualitative distinction

between  the  two  portions  of  gross  profit  that  interest  is  the  fruit  of

capital  as  such,  of  the  ownership  of  capital  irrespective  of  the

production  process,  and  that  profit  of  enterprise  is  the  fruit  of

performing  capital,  of  capital  functioning  in  the  production  process,

and hence of the active role played by the employer of the capital in

the reproduction process — this qualitative distinction is by no means

merely a subjective notion of the money capitalist, on the one hand,

and the industrial capitalist, on the other. It rests upon an objective

fact, for interest flows to the money capitalist, to the lender, who is the

mere  owner  of  capital,  hence  represents  only  ownership  of  capital

before  the  production  process  and  outside  of  it;  while  the  profit  of

enterprise flows to the functioning capitalist alone, who is non-owner

of the capital.    The merely quantitative division of the gross profit between two

different  persons  who  both  have  different  legal  claims  to  the  same

capital,  and  hence  to  the  profit  produced  by  it,  thus  turns  into  a

qualitative division for both the industrial capitalist in so far as he is

operating on borrowed capital, and for the money capitalist, in so far

as  he  does  not  himself  apply  his  capital.  One  portion  of  the  profit

appears now as fruit due as such to capital in one form, as interest;

the other portion appears as a specific fruit of capital in an opposite

form, and thus as profit of enterprise. One appears exclusively as the

fruit of operating with the capital, the fruit of performing capital, or of

the functions performed by the active capitalist. And this ossification

and individualization of the two parts of the gross profit in respect to

one another, as though they originated from two essentially different

sources, now takes firm shape for the entire capitalist class and the

total capital. And, indeed, regardless of whether the capital employed

by  the  active  capitalist  is  borrowed  or  not,  and  whether  the  capital

belonging to the money capitalist is employed by himself or not. The

profit  of  every  capital,  and  consequently  also  the  average  profit

established by the equalization of capitals, splits, or is separated, into

two  qualitatively  different,  mutually  independent  and  separately

individualized parts, to wit — interest and profit of enterprise — both of

which are determined by separate laws. The capitalist operating on his

own capital, like the one operating on borrowed capital, divides the

gross profit into interest due to himself as owner, as his own lender,

and  into  profit  of  enterprise  due  to  him  as  to  an  active  capitalist

performing  his  function.  As  concerns  this  division,  therefore,  as  a

qualitative  one,  it  is  immaterial  whether  the  capitalist  really  has  to

share  with  another,  or  not.  The  employer  of  capital,  even  when

working with his own capital, splits into two personalities — the owner

of capital and the employer of capital; with reference to the categories

of  profit  which  it  yields,  his  capital  also  splits  into  capital-property,

capital outside the production process, and yielding interest of itself,

and capital in the production process which yields a profit of enterprise

through its function.

    Interest, therefore, becomes firmly established in a way that it no

longer  appears  as  a  division  of  gross  profit  of  indifference  to

production,  which  occurs  occasionally  when  the  industrial  capitalisthappens to operate with someone else’s capital. His profit splits into

interest and profit of enterprise even when he operates on his own

capital. A merely quantitative division thus turns into a qualitative one.

It  occurs  regardless  of  the  fortuitous  circumstance  whether  the

industrial capitalist is, or is not, the owner of his capital. It is not only a

matter of different quotas of profit assigned to different persons, but

two different categories of profit which are differently related to the

capital, hence related to different aspects of the capital [...]

    Qualitatively  speaking,  interest  is  surplus  value  yielded  by  the

mere ownership of capital; it is yielded by capital as such, even though

its  owner  remains  outside  the  reproduction  process.  Hence  it  is

surplus value realized by capital outside of its process [...]

    Interest  is,  therefore,  the  expression  of  the  fact  that  value  in

general — materialized labor in its general social form — value which

assumes  the  form  of  means  of  production  in  the  actual  process  of

production, confronts living labor power as an independent power, and

is a means of appropriating unpaid labor; and that it is such a power

because it confronts the laborer as the property of another. But on the

other hand, this antithesis to wage labor is obliterated in the form of

interest, because interest-bearing capital as such has not wage labor,

but productive capital for its opposite. The lending capitalist as such

faces the capitalist performing his actual function in the process of

reproduction,  not  the  wage  worker,  who,  precisely  under  capitalist

production,  is  expropriated  of  the  means  of  production.  Interest-

bearing  capital  is  capital  as  property  as  distinct  from  capital  as  a

function. But so long as capital does not perform its function, it does

not exploit laborers and does not come into opposition to labor. On the

other hand, profit of enterprise is not related as an opposite to wage

labor, but only to interest. [... Assuming] the average profit to be given,

the rate of the profit of enterprise is not determined by wages, but by

the rate of interest. It is high or low in inverse proportion to it [...]

    [The] form of interest and profit of enterprise assumed by the two

parts of profit, i.e., of surplus value, expresses no relation to labor,

because this relation exists only between labor and profit, or rather the

surplus value as a sum, a whole, the unity of these two parts [...] If,

therefore,  the  capitalist  is  the  owner  of  the  capital  on  which  he

operates, he pockets the whole profit, or surplus value. It is absolutelyimmaterial to the laborer whether the capitalist does this, or whether

he has to pay a part of it to a third person as its legal proprietor [...]    Chapter 24: Externalization of The Relations of Capital in The

                      Form of Interest-Bearing Capital



    The relations of capital assume their most externalized and most

fetish-like  form  in  interest-bearing  capital.  We  have  here  M  —  M’,

money  creating  more  money,  self-expanding  value,  without  the

process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant’s capital, M

—  C  —  M’,  there  is  at  least  the  general  form  of  the  capitalistic

movement,  although  it  confines  itself  solely  to  the  sphere  of

circulation,  so  that  profit  appears  merely  as  profit  derived  from

alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation,

not the product of a mere thing [...] This is obliterated in M — M’, the

form  of  interest-bearing  capital  [...]  In  interest-bearing  capital,

therefore,  this  automatic  fetish,  self-expanding  value,  money

generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form

it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The social relation is

consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of

the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form

without content. As in the case of labor power, the use value of money

here  is  its  capacity  of  creating  value  —  a  value  greater  than  it

contains. Money as money is potentially self-expanding value and is

loaned  out  as  such  —  which  is  the  form  of  sale  for  this  singular

commodity. It becomes a property of money to generate value and

yield interest [... It] seems to yield interest not as a functioning capital,

but as capital in itself, as money capital [...]

    This, too, becomes distorted. While interest is only a portion of the

profit,  i.e.,  of  the  surplus  value,  which  the  functioning  capitalist

squeezes  out  of  the  laborer,  it  appears  now,  on  the  contrary,  as

though interest were the typical product of capital, the primary matter,

and profit, in the shape of profit of enterprise, were a mere accessory

and by-product of the process of reproduction. Thus we get the fetish

form of capital and the conception of fetish capital. In M — M’ we have

the meaningless form of capital, the perversion and objectification ofproduction relations in their highest degree, the interest-bearing form,

the simple form of capital, in which it antecedes its own process of

reproduction  [...]  As  interest-bearing  capital,  and  particularly  in  its

direct  form  of  interest-bearing  money  capital  (the  other  forms  of

interest-bearing capital, which do not concern us here, are derivatives

of this form and presuppose its existence), capital assumes its pure

fetish form, M — M’ being the subject, the saleable thing [...]

    The process of accumulation of capital may be conceived as an

accumulation of compound interest in the sense that the portion of

profit (surplus value) which is reconverted into capital, i.e., serves to

absorb more surplus labor, may be called interest. But:

    1) Aside from all incidental interference, a large part of available

capital  is  constantly  more  or  less  depreciated  in  the  course  of  the

reproduction  process,  because  the  value  of  commodities  is  not

determined by the labor time originally expended in their production,

but  by  the  labor  time  expended  in  their  reproduction,  and  this

decreases  continually  owing  to  the  development  of  the  social

productivity  of  labor.  On  a  higher  level  of  social  productivity,  all

available  capital  appears,  for  this  reason,  to  be  the  result  of  a

relatively short period of reproduction, instead of a long process of

accumulation of capital.

    2)  As  demonstrated  in  Part  III  of  this  book,  the  rate  of  profit

decreases in proportion to the mounting accumulation of capital and

the  correspondingly  increasing  productivity  of  social  labor,  which  is

expressed precisely in the relative and progressive decrease of the

variable as compared to the constant portion of capital. To produce

the same rate of profit after the constant capital set in motion by one

laborer  increases  ten-fold,  the  surplus  labor  time  would  have  to

increase ten-fold, and soon the total labor time, and finally the entire

24 hours of a day, would not suffice, even if wholly appropriated by

capital. The idea that the rate of profit does not shrink is, however, the

basis of Price’s progression and in general the basis of "all-engrossing

capital with compound interest". [...]                    Chapter 25: Credit and Fictitious Capital



    An exhaustive analysis of the credit system and of the instruments

which it creates for its own use (credit money, etc.) lies beyond our

plan. We merely wish to dwell here upon a few particular points, which

are  required  to  characterize  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  in

general.  We  shall  deal  only  with  commercial  and  bank  credit.  The

connection between the development of this form of credit and that of

public credit will not be considered here.

    I have shown earlier (Buch I, Kap. III) how the function of money

as  a  means  of  payment,  and  there  with  a  relation  of  creditor  and

debtor between the producer and trader of commodities, develop from

the  simple circulation  of  commodities.  With  the  development  of

commerce and of the capitalist mode of production, which produces

solely with an eye to circulation, this natural basis of the credit system

is extended, generalized, and worked out. Money serves here, by and

large, merely as a means of payment, i.e., commodities are not sold

for money, but for a written promise to pay for them at a certain date.

For brevity’s sake, we may put all these promissory notes under the

general head of bills of exchange. Such bills of exchange, in their turn,

circulate as means of payment until the day on which they fall due;

and  they  form  the  actual  commercial  money.  Inasmuch  as  they

ultimately neutralize one another through the balancing of claims and

debts, they act absolutely as money, although there is no eventual

transformation into actual money. Just as these mutual advances of

producers and merchants make up the real foundation of credit, so

does the instrument of their circulation, the bill of exchange, form the

basis of credit money proper, of banknotes, etc. These do not rest

upon  the  circulation  of  money,  be  it  metallic  or  government-issued

paper money, but rather upon the circulation of bills of exchange [...]

    The  other  side  of  the  credit  system  is  connected  with  the

development of money-dealing, which, of course, keeps step under

capitalist production with the development of dealing in commodity.We have seen in the preceding part (Chap. XIX) how the care of the

reserve funds of businessmen, the technical operations of receiving

and  disbursing  money,  of  international  payments,  and  thus  of  the

bullion trade, are concentrated in the hands of the money dealers. The

other side of the credit system — the management of interest-bearing

capital, or money capital, develops alongside this money-dealing as a

special function of the money dealers. Borrowing and lending money

becomes their particular business. They act as middlemen between

the  actual  lender  and  the  borrower  of  money  capital.  Generally

speaking,  this  aspect  of  the  banking  business  consists  of

concentrating  large  amounts  of  the  loanable  money  capital  in  the

bankers’ hands, so that, in place of the individual money lender, the

bankers confront the industrial capitalists and commercial capitalists

as  representatives  of  all  moneylenders.  They  become  the  general

managers of money capital. On the other hand, by borrowing for the

entire world of commerce, they concentrate all the borrowers vis-à-vis

all the lenders. A bank represents a centralization of money capital, of

the lenders, on the one hand, and on the other a centralization of the

borrowers. Its profit is generally made by borrowing at a lower rate of

interest than it receives in loaning.

    The  loanable  capital  which  the  banks  have  at  their  disposal

streams to them in various ways. In the first place, being the cashiers

of the industrial capitalists, all the money capital which every producer

and merchant must have as a reserve fund, or receives in payment, is

concentrated  in  their  hands.  These  funds  are  thus  converted  into

loanable  money  capital.  In  this  way,  the  reserve  fund  of  the

commercial world, because it is concentrated in a common treasury, is

reduced to its necessary minimum, and a portion of the money capital

which would otherwise have to lie slumbering as a reserve fund, is

loaned out and serves as interest-bearing capital. In the second place,

the loanable capital of the banks is formed by the deposits of money

capitalists who entrust them with the business of loaning them out.

Furthermore,  with  the  development  of  the  banking  system,  and

particularly as soon as banks came to pay interest on deposits, money

savings and the temporarily idle money of all classes were deposited

with  them.  Small  amounts,  each  in  itself  incapable  of  acting  in  the

capacity of money capital, merge together into large masses and thusform  a  money  power.  This  aggregation  of  small  amounts  must  be

distinguished as a specific function of the banking system from its go-

between  activities  between  the  money  capitalists  proper  and  the

borrowers. In the final analysis, the revenues, which are usually but

gradually consumed, are also deposited with the banks.

    The loan is made (we refer here strictly to commercial credit) by

discounting bills of exchange — by converting bills of exchange into

money before they come due — and by advances of various kinds:

direct advances on personal credit, loans against securities, such as

interest-bearing  paper,  government  paper,  stocks  of  all  sorts,  and,

notably,  overdrafts  against  bills  of  lading,  dock  warrants,  and  other

certified titles of ownership of commodities and overdrawing deposits,

etc.

    The credit given by a banker may assume various forms, such as

bills of exchange on other banks, cheques on them, credit accounts of

the same kind, and finally, if the bank is entitled to issue notes —

banknotes of the bank itself [...]

    Special  credit  institutions,  like  special  forms  of  banks,  need  no

further consideration for our purpose [...]

    The following [is] from J. W. Gilbart’s The History and Principle of

Banking, London, 1834:

    “[...]  It  is  the  object  of  banking  to  give  facilities  to  trade,  and

whatever gives facilities to trade gives facilities to speculation. Trade

and  speculation  are  in  some  cases  so  nearly  allied,  that  it  is

impossible to say at what precise point trade ends and speculation

begins.... Wherever there are banks, capital is more readily obtained,

and  at  a  cheaper  rate.  The  cheapness  of  capital  gives  facilities  to

speculation, just in the same way as the cheapness of beef and of

beer gives facilities to gluttony and drunkenness" (pp. 137, 438). "As

banks of circulation always issue their own notes, it would seem that

their  discounting  business  was  carried  on  exclusively  with  this  last

description of capital, but it is not so. It is very possible for a banker to

issue his own notes for all the bills he discounts, and yet nine-tenths of

the bills in his possession shall represent real capital. For, although in

the first instance, the banker’s notes are given for the bill, yet these

notes may not stay in circulation until the bill becomes due — the bill

may have three months to run, the notes may return in three days" (p.172). "The overdrawing of a cash credit account is a regular matter of

business; it is, in fact, the purpose for which the cash credit has been

granted.... Cash credits are granted not only upon personal security,

but also upon the security of the Public Funds" (pp. 174, 175).

    [The following is from] The Currency Theory Reviewed, etc., pp.

6263:

    "It is unquestionably true that the £1,000 which you deposit at A

today may be reissued tomorrow, and form a deposit at B. The day

after that, reissued from B, it may form a deposit at C ... and so on to

infinitude;  and  that  the  same  £1,000  in  money  may  thus,  by  a

succession  of  transfers,  multiply  itself  into  a  sum  of  deposits

absolutely indefinite. It is possible, therefore, that nine-tenths of all the

deposits in the United Kingdom may have no existence beyond their

record in the books of the bankers who are respectively accountable

for them [...]".

    [...]          Chapter 26: The Role of Credit in Capitalist Production



    The general remarks, which the credit system so far elicited from

us, were the following:

    I. Its necessary development to effect the equalization of the rate

of profit, or the movements of this equalization, upon which the entire

capitalist production rests.

    II. Reduction of the costs of circulation.

    1) One of the principal costs of circulation is money itself, being

value in itself. It is economized through credit in three ways.

    A. By dropping away entirely in a great many transactions.

    B. By the accelerated circulation of the circulating medium. This

corresponds in part with what is to be said under 2). On the one hand,

the  acceleration  is  technical;  i.e.,  with  the  same  magnitude  and

number of actual turnovers of commodities for consumption, a smaller

quantity of money or money tokens performs the same service. This is

bound up with the technique of banking. On the other hand, credit

accelerates  the  velocity  of  the  metamorphoses  of  commodities  and

thereby the velocity of money circulation.

    C. Substitution of paper for gold money.

    2) Acceleration, by means of credit, of the individual phases of

circulation  or  of  the  metamorphosis  of  commodities,  later  the

metamorphosis of capital, and with it an acceleration of the process of

reproduction in general. (On the other hand, credit helps to keep the

acts of buying and selling longer apart and serves thereby as a basis

for speculation.) Contraction of reserve funds, which may be viewed in

two ways: as a reduction of the circulating medium, on the one hand,

and, on the other, as a reduction of that part of capital which must

always exist in the form of money.

    III. Formation of stock companies. Thereby:

    1)  An  enormous  expansion  of  the  scale  of  production  and  of

enterprises, that was impossible for individual capitals. At the sametime, enterprises that were formerly government enterprises, become

public.

    2) The capital, which in itself rests on a social mode of production

and presupposes a social concentration of means of production and

labor power, is here directly endowed with the form of social capital

(capital  of  directly  associated  individuals)  as  distinct  from  private

capital, and its undertakings assume the form of social undertakings

as distinct from private undertakings. It is the abolition of capital as

private property within the framework of capitalist production itself.

    3) Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere

manager, administrator of other people’s capital, and of the owner of

capital  into  a  mere  owner,  a  mere  money  capitalist.  Even  if  the

dividends  which  they  receive  include  the  interest  and  the  profit  of

enterprise, i.e., the total profit (for the salary of the manager is, or

should be, simply the wage of a specific type of skilled labor, whose

price is regulated in the labor market like that of any other labor), this

total profit is henceforth received only in the form of interest, i.e., as

mere compensation for owning capital that now is entirely divorced

from the function in the actual process of reproduction, just as this

function in the person of the manager is divorced from ownership of

capital.  Profit  thus  appears  (no  longer  only  that  portion  of  it,  the

interest, which derives its justification from the profit of the borrower)

as a mere appropriation of the surplus labor of others, arising from the

conversion  of  means  of  production  into  capital,  i.e.,  from  their

alienation  vis-à-vis  the  actual  producer,  from  their  antithesis  as

another’s property to every individual actually at work in production,

from manager down to the last day laborer. In stock companies the

function  is  divorced  from  capital  ownership,  hence  also  labor  is

entirely divorced from ownership of means of production and surplus

labor. This result of the ultimate development of capitalist production is

a necessary transitional phase towards the reconversion of capital into

the property of producers, although no longer as the private property

of the individual producers, but rather as the property of associated

producers, as outright social property. On the other hand, the stock

company is a transition toward the conversion of all functions in the

reproduction process which still remain linked with capitalist property,

into mere functions of associated producers, into social functions.    Before we go any further, there is still the following economically

important fact to be noted: Since profit here assumes the pure form of

interest, undertakings of this sort are still possible if they yield bare

interest, and this is one of the causes, stemming the fall of the general

rate of profit, since such undertakings, in which the ratio of constant

capital to the variable is so enormous, do not necessarily enter into

the equalization of the general rate of profit [...]

    This is the abolition of the capitalist mode of production within the

capitalist  mode  of  production  itself,  and  hence  a  self-dissolving

contradiction, which prima facie represents a mere phase of transition

to a new form of production. It manifests itself as such a contradiction

in its effects. It establishes a monopoly in certain spheres and thereby

requires state interference. It reproduces a new financial aristocracy, a

new variety of parasites in the shape of promoters, speculators and

simply nominal directors; a whole system of swindling and cheating by

means  of  corporation  promotion,  stock  issuance,  and  stock

speculation.  It  is  private  production  without  the  control  of  private

property.

    IV. Aside from the stock-company business, which represents the

abolition  of  capitalist  private  industry  on  the  basis  of  the  capitalist

system itself and destroys private industry as it expands and invades

new spheres of production, credit offers to the individual capitalist; or

to  one  who  is  regarded  a  capitalist,  absolute  control  within  certain

limits over the capital and property of others, and thereby over the

labor  of  others.  The  control  over  social  capital,  not  the  individual

capital of his own, gives him control of social labor. The capital itself,

which a man really owns or is supposed to own in the opinion of the

public, becomes purely a basis for the superstructure of credit. This is

particularly true of wholesale commerce, through which the greatest

portion of the social product passes. All standards of measurement, all

excuses  more  or  less  still  justified  under  capitalist  production,

disappear  here.  What  the  speculating  wholesale  merchant  risks  is

social  property,  not  his  own.  Equally  sordid  becomes  the  phrase

relating the origin of capital to savings, for what he demands is that

others  should  save  for  him  [...]  The  other  phrase  concerning

abstention  is  squarely  refuted  by  his  luxury,  which  is  now  itself  a

means of credit. Conceptions which have some meaning on a lessdeveloped stage of capitalist production, become quite meaningless

here. Success and failure both lead here to a centralization of capital,

and thus to expropriation on the most enormous scale. Expropriation

extends  here  from  the  direct  producers  to  the  smaller  and  the

medium-sized capitalists themselves. It is the point of departure for

the capitalist mode of production; its accomplishment is the goal of

this production. In the last instance, it aims at the expropriation of the

means of production from all individuals.

    With  the  development  of  social  production,  the  means  of

production cease to be means of private production and products of

private production, and can thereafter be only means of production in

the hands of associated producers, i.e., the latter’s social property,

much as they are their social products. However, this expropriation

appears  within  the  capitalist  system  in  a  contradictory  form,  as

appropriation of social property by a few; and credit lends the latter

more and more the aspect of pure adventurers. Since property here

exists in the form of stock, its movement and transfer become purely a

result  of  gambling  on  the  stock  exchange,  where  the  little  fish  are

swallowed  by  the  sharks  and  the  lambs  by  the  stock-exchange

wolves.  There  is  antagonism  against  the  old  form  in  the  stock

companies,  in  which  social  means  of  production  appear  as  private

property; but the conversion to the form of stock still remains ensnared

in  the  trammels  of  capitalism;  hence,  instead  of  overcoming  the

antithesis between the character of wealth as social and as private

wealth, the stock companies merely develop it in a new form.

    The co-operative factories of the laborers themselves represent

within the old form the first sprouts of the new, although they naturally

reproduce,  and  must  reproduce,  everywhere  in  their  actual

organization  all  the  shortcomings  of  the  prevailing  system.  But  the

antithesis between capital and labor is overcome within them, if at first

only by way of making the associated laborers into their own capitalist,

i.e.,  by  enabling  them  to  use  the  means  of  production  for  the

employment  of  their  own  labor.  They  show  how  a  new  mode  of

production naturally grows out of an old one, when the development of

the material forces of production and of the corresponding forms of

social production have reached a particular stage. Without the factory

system  arising  out  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  there  couldhave been no co-operative factories. Nor could these have developed

without the credit system arising out of the same mode of production.

The  credit  system  is  not  only  the  principal  basis  for  the  gradual

transformation  of  capitalist  private  enterprises  into  capitalist  stock

companies, but equally offers the means for the gradual extension of

co-operative  enterprises  on  a  more  or  less  national  scale.  The

capitalist  stock  companies,  as  much  as  the  co-operative  factories,

should be considered as transitional forms from the capitalist mode of

production  to  the  associated  one,  with  the  only  distinction  that  the

antagonism  is  resolved  negatively  in  the  one  and  positively  in  the

other.

    So far we have considered the development of the credit system

— and the implicit latent abolition of capitalist property — mainly with

reference  to  industrial  capital.  In  the  following  Chapter’s  we  shall

consider credit with reference to interest-bearing capital as such, and

to its effect on this capital, and the form it thereby assumes; and there

are  generally  a  few  more  specifically  economic  remarks  still  to  be

made.

    But first this:

    The credit system appears as the main lever of overproduction

and  over-speculation  in  commerce  solely  because  the  reproduction

process, which is elastic by nature, is here forced to its extreme limits,

and is so forced because a large part of the social capital is employed

by people who do not own it and who consequently tackle things quite

differently than the owner, who anxiously weighs the limitations of his

private  capital  in  so  far  as  he  handles  it  himself.  This  simply

demonstrates the fact that the self-expansion of capital based on the

contradictory  nature  of  capitalist  production  permits  an  actual  free

development only up to a certain point, so that in fact it constitutes an

immanent  fetter  and  barrier  to  production,  which  are  continually

broken  through  by  the  credit  system.  Hence,  the  credit  system

accelerates the material development of the productive forces and the

establishment of the world market. It is the historical mission of the

capitalist system of production to raise these material foundations of

the new mode of production to a certain degree of perfection. At the

same time credit accelerates the violent eruptions of this contradiction—  crises  —  and  thereby  the  elements  of  disintegration  of  the  old

mode of production.

    The two characteristics immanent in the credit system are, on the

one hand, to develop the incentive of capitalist production, enrichment

through  exploitation  of  the  labor  of  others,  to  the  purest  and  most

colossal  form  of  gambling  and  swindling,  and  to  reduce  more  and

more the number of the few who exploit the social wealth; on the other

hand, to constitute the form of transition to a new mode of production.

It is this ambiguous nature, which endows the principal spokesmen of

credit from Law to Isaac Péreire with the pleasant character mixture of

swindler and prophet [...]                Chapter 27: Component Parts of Bank Capital



    [...]  Bank  capital  consists  of  1)  cash  money,  gold  or  notes;  2)

securities.  The  latter  can  be  subdivided  into  two  parts:  commercial

paper or bills of exchange, which run for a period, become due from

time to time, and whose discounting constitutes the essential business

of  the  banker;  and  public  securities,  such  as  government  bonds,

treasury  notes,  stocks  of  all  kinds,  in  short,  interest-bearing  paper

which  is  however  significantly  different  from  bills  of  exchange.

Mortgages may also be included here. The capital composed of these

tangible  component  parts  can  again  be  divided  into  the  banker’s

invested capital and into deposits, which constitute his banking capital,

or borrowed capital. In the case of banks which issue notes, these

must  be  included.  We  shall  leave  the  deposits  and  notes  out  of

consideration for the present. It is evident at any rate that the actual

component  parts  of  the  banker’s  capital  (money,  bills  of  exchange,

deposit  currency)  remain  unaffected  whether  the  various  elements

represent the banker’s own capital or deposits, i.e., the capital of other

people. The same division would remain, whether he was to carry on

his business with only his own capital or only with deposited capital

[...]

    The formation of a fictitious capital is called capitalization. Every

periodic  income  is  capitalized  by  calculating  it  on  the  basis  of  the

average rate of interest, as an income which would be realized by a

capital  loaned  at  this  rate  of  interest.  For  example,  if  the  annual

income  is  £100  and  the  rate  of  interest  5%,  then  the  £100  would

represent the annual interest on £2,000, and the £2,000 is regarded

as  the  capital  value  of  the  legal  title  of  ownership  on  the  £100

annually. For the person who buys this title of ownership, the annual

income of £100 represents indeed the interest on his capital invested

at 5%. All connection with the actual expansion process of capital is

thus completely lost, and the conception of capital as something with

automatic self-expansion properties is thereby strengthened.    Even  when  the  promissory  note  —  the  security  —  does  not

represent  a  purely  fictitious  capital,  as  it  does  in  the  case  of  state

debts, the capital value of such paper is nevertheless wholly illusory.

We have previously seen in what manner the credit system creates

associated  capital.  The  paper  serves  as  title  of  ownership  which

represents  this  capital.  The  stocks  of  railways,  mines,  navigation

companies, and the like, represent actual capital, namely, the capital

invested and functioning in such enterprises, or the amount of money

advanced by the stockholders for the purpose of being used as capital

in such enterprises. This does not preclude the possibility that these

may represent pure swindle. But this capital does not exist twice, once

as the capital value of titles of ownership (stocks) on the one hand and

on the other hand as the actual capital invested, or to be invested, in

those enterprises. It exists only in the latter form, and a share of stock

is merely a title of ownership to a corresponding portion of the surplus

value to be realized by it. A may sell this title to B, and B may sell it to

C.  These  transactions  do  not  alter  anything  in  the  nature  of  the

problem. A or B then has his title in the form of capital, but C has

transformed his capital into a mere title of ownership to the anticipated

surplus value from the stock capital.

    The  independent  movement  of  the  value  of  these  titles  of

ownership,  not  only  of  government  bonds  but  also  of  stocks,  adds

weight to the illusion that they constitute real capital alongside of the

capital  or  claim  to  which  they  may  have  title.  For  they  become

commodities, whose price has its own characteristic movements and

is  established  in  its  own  way.  Their  market  value  is  determined

differently from their nominal value, without any change in the value

(even though the expansion may change) of the actual capital. On the

one hand, their market value fluctuates with the amount and reliability

of the proceeds to which they afford legal title. If the nominal value of

a share of stock, that is, the invested sum originally represented by

this share, is £100, and the enterprise pays 10% instead of 5%, then

its market value, everything else remaining equal, rises to £200, as

long as the rate of interest is 5%, for when capitalized at 5%, it now

represents  a  fictitious  capital  of  £200.  Whoever  buys  it  for  £200

receives a revenue of 5% on this investment of capital. The converse

is true when the proceeds from the enterprise diminish.    The market value of this paper is in part speculative, since it is

determined not only by the actual income, but also by the anticipated

income, which is calculated in advance. But assuming the expansion

of the actual capital as constant, or where no capital exists, as in the

case  of  state  debts,  the  annual  income  to  be  fixed  by  law  and

otherwise sufficiently secured, the price of these securities rises and

falls inversely as the rate of interest. If the rate of interest rises from

5% to 10%, then securities guaranteeing an income of £5 will now

represent a capital of only £50. Conversely, if the rate of interest falls

to 2 %; the same securities will represent a capital of £200. Their
    1/2

value  is  always  merely  capitalized  income,  that  is,  the  income

calculated on the basis of a fictitious capital at the prevailing rate of

interest. Therefore, when the money market is tight these securities

will fall in price for two reasons: first, because the rate of interest rises,

and  secondly,  because  they  are  thrown  on  the  market  in  large

quantities in order to convert them into cash [...]

    All this paper actually represents nothing more than accumulated

claims,  or  legal  titles,  to  future  production  whose  money  or  capital

value represents either no capital at all, as in the case of state debts,

or  is  regulated  independently  of  the  value  of  real  capital  which  it

represents.

    In all countries based on capitalist production, there exists in this

form  an  enormous  quantity  of  so-called  interest-bearing  capital,  or

moneyed capital. And by accumulation of money capital nothing more,

in  the  main,  is  connoted  than  an  accumulation  of  these  claims  on

production, an accumulation of the market price, the illusory capital

value of these claims.

    A  part  of  the  banker’s  capital  is  now  invested  in  this  so-called

interest-bearing paper. This is itself a portion of the reserve capital,

which does not perform any function in the actual business of banking.

The most important portion of this paper consists of bills of exchange,

that is, promises to pay made by industrial capitalists or merchants.

For the money lender these bills of exchange are interest-bearing, in

other  words,  when  he  buys  them,  he  deducts  interest  for  the  time

which they still have to run. This is called discounting. It depends on

the prevailing rate of interest, how much of a deduction is made from

the sum represented by the bill of exchange.    Finally,  the  last  part  of  the  capital  of  a  banker  consists  of  his

money  reserve  in  gold  and  notes.  The  deposits,  unless  tied  up  by

agreement  for  a  certain  time,  are  always  at  the  disposal  of  the

depositors. They are in a state of continual fluctuation. But while one

depositor draws on his account, another deposits, so that the general

average sum total of deposits fluctuates little during periods of normal

business.

    The  reserve  funds  of  the  banks,  in  countries  with  developed

capitalist production, always express on the average the quantity of

money existing in the form of a hoard, and a portion of this hoard in

turn consists of paper, mere drafts upon gold, which have no value in

themselves.  The  greater  portion  of  banker's  capital  is,  therefore,

purely fictitious and consists of claims (bills of exchange), government

securities (which represent spent capital), and stocks (drafts on future

revenue). And it should not be forgotten that the money value of the

capital represented by this paper in the safes of the banker is itself

fictitious,  in  so  far  as  the  paper  consists  of  drafts  on  guaranteed

revenue  (e.g.,  government  securities),  or  titles  of  ownership  to  real

capital (e.g., stocks), and that this value is regulated differently from

that of the real capital, which the paper represents at least in part; or,

when it represents mere claims on revenue and no capital, the claim

on the same revenue is expressed in continually changing fictitious

money capital. In addition to this, it must be noted that this fictitious

banker’s capital represents largely, not his own capital, but that of the

public, which makes deposits with him, either interest-bearing or not

[...]

    With  the  development  of  interest-bearing  capital  and  the  credit

system, all capital seems to double itself, and sometimes treble itself,

by the various modes in which the same capital, or perhaps even the

same claim on a debt, appears in different forms in different hands.

The greater portion of this "money capital” is purely fictitious. All the

deposits, with the exception of the reserve fund, are merely claims on

the banker, which, however, never exist as deposits. To the extent

that  they  serve  in  clearing-house  transactions,  they  perform  the

function of capital for the bankers — after the latter have loaned them

out. They pay one another their mutual drafts upon the non-existing

deposits by balancing their mutual accounts [...]                Chapter 28: Money Capital and Real Capital. I



    The  only  difficult  questions,  which  we  are  now  approaching  in

connection with the credit system, are the following:

    First:  The  accumulation  of  the  actual  money  capital.  To  what

extent  is  it,  and  to  what  extent  is  it  not,  an  indication  of  an  actual

accumulation of capital, i.e., of reproduction on an extended scale? Is

the  so-called  plethora  of  capital  —  an  expression  used  only  with

reference to the interest-bearing capital, i.e., moneyed capital — only

a  special  way  of  expressing  industrial  overproduction,  or  does  it

constitute a separate phenomenon alongside of it? Does this plethora,

or excessive supply of money capital, coincide with the existence of

stagnating masses of money (bullion, gold coin and banknotes), so

that  this  superabundance  of  actual  money  is  the  expression  and

external form of that plethora of loan capital?

    Secondly:  To  what  extent  does  a  scarcity  of  money,  i.e.,  a

shortage of loan capital, express a shortage of real capital (commodity

capital and productive capital)? To what extent does it coincide, on the

other  hand,  with  a  shortage  of  money  as  such,  a  shortage  of  the

medium of circulation?

    In  so  far  as  we  have  hitherto  considered  the  peculiar  form  of

accumulation of money capital and of money wealth in general, it has

resolved itself into an accumulation of claims of ownership upon labor.

The accumulation of the capital of the national debt has been revealed

to mean merely an increase in a class of state creditors, who have the

privilege of a firm claim upon a certain portion of the tax revenue. By

means of these facts, whereby even an accumulation of debts may

appear as an accumulation of capital, the height of distortion taking

place  in  the  credit  system  becomes  apparent.  These  promissory

notes,  which  are  issued  for  the  originally  loaned  capital  long  since

spent,  these  paper  duplicates  of  consumed  capital,  serve  for  their

owners as capital to the extent that they are saleable commodities and

may, therefore, be reconverted into capital.    Titles  of  ownership  to  public  works,  railways,  mines,  etc.,  are

indeed, as we have also seen, titles to real capital. But they do not

place this capital at one's disposal. It is not subject to withdrawal. They

merely  convey  legal  claims  to  a  portion  of  the  surplus  value  to  be

produced by it. But these titles likewise become paper duplicates of

the real capital; it is as though a bill of lading were to acquire a value

separate from the cargo, both concomitantly and simultaneously with

it. They come to nominally represent non-existent capital. For the real

capital exists side by side with them and does not change hands as a

result of the transfer of these duplicates from one person to another.

They assume the form of interest-bearing capital, not only because

they guarantee a certain income, but also because, through their sale,

their repayment as capital values can be obtained. To the extent that

the  accumulation  of  this  paper  expresses  the  accumulation  of

railways, mines, steamships, etc., to that extent does it express the

extension of the actual reproduction process — just as the extension

of, for example, a tax list on movable property indicates the expansion

of this property. But as duplicates which are themselves objects of

transactions  as  commodities,  and  thus  able  to  circulate  as  capital

values,  they  are  illusory,  and  their  value  may  fall  or  rise  quite

independently of the movement of value of the real capital for which

they  are  titles.  Their  value,  that  is,  their  quotation  on  the  Stock

Exchange, necessarily has a tendency to rise with a fall in the rate of

interest  —  in  so  far  as  this  fall,  independent  of  the  characteristic

movements of money capital, is due merely to the tendency for the

rate of profit to fall; therefore, this imaginary wealth expands, if for this

reason alone, in the course of capitalist production in accordance with

the expressed value for each of its aliquot parts of specific original

nominal value [...]

    [In]  addition  to  this  commercial  credit  we  have  actual  money

credit. The advances of the industrialists and merchants among one

another are amalgamated with the money advances made to them by

the bankers and money lenders. In discounting bills of exchange, the

advance is only nominal. A manufacturer sells his product for a bill of

exchange and gets this bill discounted by some bill-broker. In reality,

the latter advances only the credit of his banker, who in turn advances

to  the  broker  the  money  capital  of  his  depositors.  The  depositorsconsist of the industrial capitalists and merchants themselves and also

of  workers  (through  savings  banks)  —  as  well  as  ground  rent

recipients and other unproductive classes. In this way every individual

industrial  manufacturer  and  merchant  gets  around  the  necessity  of

keeping a large reserve fund and being dependent upon his actual

returns.  On  the  other  hand,  the  whole  process  becomes  so

complicated, partly by simply manipulating bills of exchange, partly by

commodity transactions for the sole purpose of manufacturing bills of

exchange,  that  the  semblance  of  a  very  solvent  business  with  a

smooth  flow  of  returns  can  easily  persist  even  long  after  returns

actually come in only at the expense partly of swindled money lenders

and  partly  of  swindled  producers.  Thus  business  always  appears

almost excessively sound right on the eve of a crash. The best proof

of this is furnished, for instance, by the Reports on Bank Acts of 1857

and  1858,  in  which  all  bank  directors,  merchants,  in  short  all  the

invited experts with Lord Overstone at their head, congratulated one

another  on  the  prosperity  and  soundness  of  business  —  just  one

month before the outbreak of the crisis in August 1857 [...] Business is

always  thoroughly  sound  and  the  campaign  in  full  swing,  until

suddenly the debacle takes place.

    We revert now to the accumulation of money capital.

    Not every augmentation of loanable money capital indicates a real

accumulation of capital or expansion of the reproduction process. This

becomes most evident in the phase of the industrial cycle immediately

following a crisis, when loan capital lies around idle in great quantities.

At such times, when the production process is curtailed (production in

the English industrial districts was reduced by one-third after the crisis

of 1847), when the prices of commodities are at their lowest level,

when the spirit of enterprise is paralyzed, the rate of interest is low,

which in this case indicates nothing more than an increase in loanable

capital  precisely  as  a  result  of  contraction  and  paralyzation  of

industrial capital [...] Hence the demand for loanable money capital,

either to act as a medium of circulation or as a means of payment (the

investment of new capital is still out of the question), decreases and

this  capital,  therefore,  becomes  relatively  abundant.  Under  such

circumstances,  however,  the  supply  of  loanable  money  capital  also

increases, as we shall later see [...]    After  the  reproduction  process  has  again  reached  that  state  of

prosperity  which  precedes  that  of  over-exertion,  commercial  credit

becomes very much extended; this forms, indeed, the "sound" basis

again for a ready flow of returns and extended production. In this state

the rate of interest is still low, although it rises above its minimum. This

is, in fact, the only time that it can be said a low rate of interest, and

consequently a relative abundance of loanable capital, coincides with

a real expansion of industrial capital. The ready flow and regularity of

the  returns,  linked  with  extensive  commercial  credit,  ensures  the

supply  of  loan  capital  in  spite  of  the  increased  demand  for  it,  and

prevents the level of the rate of interest from rising. On the other hand,

those cavaliers who work without any reserve capital or without any

capital at all and who thus operate completely on a money credit basis

begin to appear for the first time in considerable numbers. To this is

now added the great expansion of fixed capital in all forms, and the

opening  of  new  enterprises  on  a  vast  and  far-reaching  scale.  The

interest now rises to its average level. It reaches its maximum again

as  soon  as  the  new  crisis  sets  in.  Credit  suddenly  stops  then,

payments are suspended, the reproduction process is paralyzed, and

with the previously mentioned exceptions, a superabundance of idle

industrial  capital  appears  side  by  side  with  an  almost  absolute

absence of loan capital.

    On the whole, then, the movement of loan capital, as expressed in

the  rate  of  interest,  is  in  the  opposite  direction  to  that  of  industrial

capital.  The  phase  wherein  a  low  rate  of  interest,  but  above  the

minimum, coincides with the "improvement" and growing confidence

after a crisis, and particularly the phase wherein the rate of interest

reaches its average level, exactly midway between its minimum and

maximum,  are  the  only  two  periods  during  which  an  abundance  of

loan  capital  is  available  simultaneously  with  a  great  expansion  of

industrial capital. But at the beginning of the industrial cycle, a low rate

of interest coincides with a contraction, and at the end of the industrial

cycle,  a  high  rate  of  interest  coincides  with  a  superabundance  of

industrial capital [...]

    It is clear that there is a shortage of means of payment during a

period  of  crisis.  The  convertibility  of  bills  of  exchange  replaces  the

metamorphosis  of  commodities  themselves,  and  so  much  more  soexactly at such times the more a portion of the firms operates on pure

credit [...]

    In  a  system  of  production,  where  the  entire  continuity  of  the

reproduction process rests upon credit, a crisis must obviously occur

— a tremendous rush for means of payment — when credit suddenly

ceases  and  only  cash  payments  have  validity.  At  first  glance,

therefore, the whole crisis seems to be merely a credit and money

crisis. And in fact it is only a question of the convertibility of bills of

exchange into money. But the majority of these bills represent actual

sales  and  purchases,  whose  extension  far  beyond  the  needs  of

society is, after all, the basis of the whole crisis. At the same time, an

enormous quantity of these bills of exchange represents plain swindle,

which  now  reaches  the  light  of  day  and  collapses;  furthermore,

unsuccessful  speculation  with  the  capital  of  other  people;  finally,

commodity capital which has depreciated or is completely unsaleable,

or returns that can never more be realized again. The entire artificial

system  of  forced  expansion  of  the  reproduction  process  cannot,  of

course, be remedied by having some bank, like the Bank of England,

give to all the swindlers the deficient capital by means of its paper and

having it buy up all the depreciated commodities at their old nominal

values. Incidentally, everything here appears distorted, since in this

paper world, the real price and its real basis appear nowhere, but only

bullion, metal coin, notes, bills of exchange, securities [...]

      Incidentally in connection with the superabundance of industrial

capital  which  appears  during  crises  the  following  should  be  noted:

commodity capital is in itself simultaneously money capital, that is, a

definite amount of value expressed in the price of the commodities. As

use value it is a definite quantum of objects of utility, and there is a

surplus of these available in times of crises. But as money capital as

such, as potential money capital, it is subject to continual expansion

and  contraction.  On  the  eve  of  a  crisis,  and  during  it,  commodity

capital  in  its  capacity  as  potential  money  capital  is  contracted.  It

represents less money capital for its owner and his creditors (as well

as security for bills of exchange and loans) than it did at the time when

it  was  bought  and  when  the  discounts  and  mortgages  based  on  it

were  transacted.  If  this  is  the  meaning  of  the  contention  that  themoney capital of a country is reduced in times of stringency, this is

identical with saying that the prices of commodities have fallen [...]

    It follows from the above that commodity capital, during crises and

during  periods  of  business  depression  in  general,  loses  to  a  large

extent its capacity to represent potential money capital. The same is

true of fictitious capital, interest-bearing paper, in so far as it circulates

on  the  stock  exchange  as  money  capital.  Its  price  falls  with  rising

interest. It falls, furthermore, as a result of the general shortage of

credit, which compels its owners to dump it in large quantities on the

market in order to secure money. It falls, finally, in the case of stocks,

partly as a result of the decrease in revenues for which it constitutes

drafts  and  partly  as  a  result  of  the  spurious  character  of  the

enterprises  which  it  often  enough  represents.  This  fictitious  money

capital is enormously reduced in times of crisis, and with it the ability

of  its  owners  to  borrow  money  on  it  on  the  market.  However,  the

reduction of the money equivalents of these securities on the stock

exchange  list  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  actual  capital  which  they

represent, but very much indeed with the solvency of their owners.        Chapter 29: Money Capital and Real Capital. II (Continued)



    We are still not finished with this question: to what extent does the

accumulation of capital in the form of loanable money capital coincide

with  actual  accumulation,  i.e.,  the  expansion  of  the  reproduction

process.

    The  transformation  of  money  into  loanable  money  capital  is  a

much simpler matter than the transformation of money into productive

capital. But two things should be distinguished here:

    1) the mere transformation of money into loan capital;

    2) the transformation of capital or revenue into money, which is

transformed into loan capital.

    It is only the latter point which can involve a positive accumulation

of  loan  capital  connected  with  an  actual  accumulation  of  industrial

capital.

    1. TRANSFORMATION OF MONEY INTO LOAN CAPITAL

    We  have  already  seen  that  a  large  build-up  or  surplus  of  loan

capital can occur, which is connected with productive accumulation

only to the extent that it is inversely proportional to it. This is the case

in  two  phases  of  the  industrial  cycle,  namely,  first,  when  industrial

capital  in  both  its  forms  of  productive  and  commodity  capital  is

contracted,  i.e.,  at  the  beginning  of  the  cycle  after  the  crisis;  and,

secondly, when the improvement begins, but when commercial credit

still does not use bank credit to a great extent. In the first case, money

capital, which was formerly employed in production and commerce,

appears as idle loan capital; in the second case, it appears used to an

increasing  extent,  but  at  a  very  low  rate  of  interest,  because  the

industrial  and  commercial  capitalists  now  prescribe  terms  to  the

money  capitalist.  The  surplus  of  loan  capital  expresses,  in  the  first

case, a stagnation of industrial capital, and in the second, a relative

independence of commercial credit from banking credit — based on

the fluidity of the returns, short-term credit, and a preponderance of

operations with one’s own capital.    The speculators, who count on the credit capital of other people,

have not yet appeared on the field; the people who work with their

own  capital  are  still  far  removed  from  approximately  pure  credit

operations. In the former phase, the surplus of loan capital is directly

opposite to expressing actual accumulation. In the second phase, it

coincides with a renewed expansion of the reproduction process — it

accompanies  it,  but  is  not  its  cause.  The  surplus  of  loan  capital  is

already  decreasing,  i.e.,  it  is  still  only  relative  compared  to  the

demand.  In  both  cases,  the  expansion  of  the  actual  process  of

accumulation is promoted by the fact that the low interest — which

coincides  in  the  first  case  with  low  prices  and  in  the  second,  with

slowly  rising  prices  —  increases  that  portion  of  the  profit  which  is

transformed  into  profit  of  enterprise.  This  takes  place  to  an  even

greater extent when interest rises to its average level during the height

of the period of prosperity, when it has indeed grown, but not relative

to profit.

    We have seen, on the other hand, that an accumulation of loan

capital can take place without any actual accumulation, i.e., by mere

technical  means  such  as  an  expansion  and  concentration  of  the

banking  system;  and  a  saving  in  the  circulation  reserve,  or  in  the

reserve  fund  of  private  means  of  payment,  which  are  then  always

transformed  into  loan  capital  for  a  short  time.  Although  this  loan

capital, which, for this reason, is also called floating capital, always

retains  the  form  of  loan  capital  only  for  short  periods  of  time  (and

should indeed also be used for discounting only for short periods of

time), there is a continual ebb and flow of it. If one draws some away,

another adds to it. The mass of loanable money capital thus grows

quite independently of the actual accumulation (we are not speaking

here at all about loans for a number of years but only of short-term

ones on bills of exchange and deposits) [...]

    The variations in the interest rate (aside from those occurring over

longer  periods  or  the  variation  in  the  interest  rate  among  various

countries;  the  former  are  dependent  upon  variations  in  the  general

rate of profit, the latter on differences in the rates of profit and in the

development  of  credit)  depend  upon  the  supply  of  loan  capital  (all

other circumstances, state of confidence, etc. being equal), that is, of

capital  loaned  in  the  form  of  money,  coin  and  notes;  incontradistinction to industrial capital, which, as such — in commodity

form — is loaned by means of commercial credit among the agents of

reproduction themselves.

    However,  the  mass  of  this  loanable  money  capital  is  different

from, and independent of, the mass of circulating money.

    For  example,  if  £20  were  loaned  five  times  per  day,  a  money

capital of £100 would be loaned, and this would imply at the same

time that this £20 would have served, moreover, at least four times as

a means of purchase or payment; for, if no purchase and payment

intervened — so that it would not have represented at least four times

the converted form of capital (commodities, including labor power) —

it would not constitute a capital of £100, but only five claims of £20

each.

    In  countries  with  a  developed  credit,  we  can  assume  that  all

money capital available for lending exists in the form of deposits with

banks  and  money  lenders.  This  is  at  least  true  for  business  as  a

whole.  Moreover,  in  times  of  flourishing  business,  before  the  real

speculation gets underway — when credit is easy and confidence is

growing — most of the functions of circulation are settled by a simple

transfer of credit, without the help of coin or paper money.

    The mere possibility of large sums of deposits existing when a

relatively  small  quantum  of  a  medium  of  circulation  is  available,

depends solely on:

    1) the number of purchases and payments which the same coin

performs;

    2) the number of return excursions, whereby it goes back to the

banks  as  deposits,  so  that  its  repeated  function  as  a  means  of

purchase  and  payment  is  promoted  through  its  renewed

transformation  into  deposits.  For  example,  a  small  dealer  deposits

weekly with his banker £100 in money; the banker pays out a portion

of  the  deposit  of  a  manufacturer  with  this;  the  latter  pays  it  to  his

workers; and the workers use it to pay the small dealer, who deposits

it in the bank again. The £100 deposited by this small dealer have

served,  therefore,  first,  to  pay  the  manufacturer  a  deposit  of  his;

secondly,  to  pay  the  workers;  thirdly,  to  pay  the  dealer  himself;

fourthly, to deposit another portion of the money capital of the same

small dealer; thus at the end of twenty weeks, if he himself did nothave to draw against this money, he would have deposited £2,000 in

the bank by means of the same £100 [...]

    2.  TRANSFORMATION  OF  CAPITAL  OR  REVENUE  INTO

MONEY THAT IS TRANSFORMED INTO LOAN CAPITAL

    We will consider here the accumulation of money capital, in so far

as  it  is  not  an  expression  either  of  a  stoppage  in  the  flow  of

commercial credit or of an economy — whether it be an economy in

the actual circulating medium or in the reserve capital of the agents

engaged in reproduction [...]

    The accumulation of all money-lending capitalists naturally always

takes place directly in money form, whereas we have seen that the

actual accumulation of industrial capitalists is accomplished, as a rule,

by an increase in the elements of reproductive capital itself. Hence,

the development of the credit system and the enormous concentration

of the money-lending business in the hands of large banks must, by

themselves alone, accelerate the accumulation of loanable capital, as

a form distinct from actual accumulation. This rapid development of

loan capital is, therefore, a result of actual accumulation, for it is a

consequence of the development of the reproduction process, and the

profit  which  forms  the  source  of  accumulation  for  these  money

capitalists  is  only  a  deduction  from  the  surplus  value  which  the

reproductive ones filch (and it is at the same time the appropriation of

a  portion  of  the  interest  from  the  savings  of  others).  Loan  capital

accumulates  at  the  expense  of  both  the  industrial  and  commercial

capitalists.  We  have  seen  that  in  the  unfavorable  phases  of  the

industrial cycle the rate of interest may rise so high that it temporarily

consumes  the  whole  profit  of  some  lines  of  business  which  are

particularly handicapped. At the same time, prices of government and

other securities fall. It is at such times that the money capitalists buy

this depreciated paper in huge quantities which in the later phases

soon regains its former level and rises above it. It is then sold again

and a portion of the money capital of the public is thus appropriated.

That portion which is not sold yields a higher interest because it was

bought below par. But the money capitalists convert all profits made,

and reconverted by them into capital, first into loanable money capital.

The  accumulation  of  the  latter  —  as  distinct  from  the  actual

accumulation, although its offshoot — thus takes place, even when weconsider only the money capitalists, bankers, etc., by themselves, as

an accumulation of this particular class of capitalists. And it must grow

with  every  expansion  of  the  credit  system  which  accompanies  the

actual expansion of the reproduction process [...]

    As for the money accumulation of the other classes of capitalists,

we  disregard  that  portion  of  it  which  is  invested  in  interest-bearing

paper  and  accumulates  in  this  form.  We  consider  only  that  portion

which is thrown upon the market as loanable money capital.

    In the first place, we have here that portion of the profit which is

not spent as revenue, but is set aside for accumulation — for which,

however, the industrial capitalists have no use in their own business at

the moment. This profit exists directly in commodity capital, a part of

whose  value  it  constitutes,  and  along  with  which  it  is  realized  in

money. Now, if it is not reconverted into the production elements of

commodity capital (we leave out of consideration for the present the

merchant, whom we shall discuss separately), it must remain for a

length of time in the form of money. This amount increases with the

amount of capital itself, even when the rate of profit declines. That

portion which is to be spent as revenue is gradually consumed, but, in

the meantime, as deposits, it constitutes loan capital with the banker.

Thus,  even  the  growth  of  that  portion  of  profit  which  is  spent  as

revenue  expresses  itself  as  a  gradual  and  continually  repeated

accumulation of loan capital. The same is true of the other portion,

which is intended for accumulation. Therefore, with the development

of the credit system and its organization, even an increase in revenue,

i.e.,  the  consumption  of  the  industrial  and  commercial  capitalists,

expresses itself as an accumulation of loan capital. And this holds true

for all revenues so far as they are consumed gradually, in other words,

for ground rent, wages in their higher form, incomes of unproductive

classes, etc. All of them assume for a certain time the form of money

revenue  and  are,  therefore,  convertible  into  deposits  and  thus  into

loan capital. All revenue — whether it be intended for consumption or

accumulation — as long as it exists in some form of money, is a part

of the value of commodity capital transformed into money, and is, for

this reason, an expression and result of actual accumulation, but is not

productive capital itself [...]      Chapter 30: Money Capital and Real Capital. Ill (Concluded)



    The mass of money to be transformed back into capital in this

manner  is  a  result  of  the  enormous  reproduction  process,  but

considered by itself, as loanable money capital, it is not itself a mass

of reproductive capital.

    The  most  important  point  of  our  presentation  so  far  is  that  the

expansion  of  the  part  of  the  revenue  intended  for  consumption

(leaving out of consideration the worker, because his revenue is equal

to  the  variable  capital)  shows  itself  at  first  as  an  accumulation  of

money  capital.  A  factor,  therefore,  enters  into  the  accumulation  of

money capital that is essentially different from the actual accumulation

of  industrial  capital;  for  the  portion  of  the  annual  product  which  is

intended for consumption does not by any means become capital. A

portion of it replaces capital, i.e., the constant capital of the producers

of  means  of  consumption,  but  to  the  extent  that  it  is  actually

transformed into capital, it exists in the natural form of the revenue of

the  producers  of  this  constant  capital.  The  same  money,  which

represents  the  revenue  and  serves  merely  for  the  promotion  of

consumption, is regularly transformed into loanable money capital for

a period of time. In so far as this money represents wages, it is at the

same time the money form of the variable capital; and in so far as it

replaces  the  constant  capital  of  the  producers  of  means  of

consumption,  it  is  the  money  form  temporarily  assumed  by  their

constant  capital  and  serves  to  purchase  the  components  of  their

constant capital to be replaced in kind. Neither in the one nor in the

other form does it express in itself accumulation, although its quantity

increases with the growth of the reproduction process. But it performs

temporarily the function of loanable money, i.e., of money capital. In

this respect, therefore, the accumulation of money capital must always

reflect a greater accumulation of capital than actually exists, owing to

the  fact  that  the  extension  of  individual  consumption,  because  it  is

promoted by means of money, appears as an accumulation of moneycapital, since it furnishes the money form for actual accumulation, i.e.,

for money which permits new investments of capital.

    Thus, the accumulation of loanable money capital expresses in

part  only  the  fact  that  all  money  into  which  industrial  capital  is

transformed in the course of its circuit assumes the form not of money

advanced by the reproductive capitalists, but of money borrowed by

them; so that indeed the advance of money that must take place in the

reproduction process appears as an advance of borrowed money. In

fact, on the basis of commercial credit, one person lends to another

the  money  required  for  the  reproduction  process.  But  this  now

assumes the following form: the banker, who receives the money as a

loan from one group of the reproductive capitalists, lends it to another

group of reproductive capitalists, so that the banker appears in the

role of a supreme benefactor; and at the same time, the control over

this capital falls completely into the hands of the banker in his capacity

as middleman.

    A few special forms of accumulation of money capital still remain

to be mentioned. For example, capital is released by a fall in the price

of  the  elements  of  production,  raw  materials,  etc.  If  the  industrial

capitalist  cannot  expand  his  reproduction  process  immediately,  a

portion of his money capital is expelled from the circuit as superfluous

and is transformed into loanable money capital. Secondly, however,

capital in the form of money is released especially by the merchant,

whenever interruptions in his business take place. If the merchant has

completed  a  series  of  transactions  and  cannot  begin  a  new  series

because  of  such  interruptions  until  later,  the  money  realized

represents for him only a hoard, surplus capital. But at the same time,

it represents a direct accumulation of loanable money capital [...]

    Finally,  accumulation  of  money  capital  is  influenced  by  the

number of people who have feathered their nests and have withdrawn

from reproduction. Their number increases as more profits are made

in the course of the industrial cycle. In this case, the accumulation of

loanable  money  capital  expresses,  on  the  one  hand,  an  actual

accumulation (in accordance with its relative extent), and, on the other

hand, only the extent of the transformation of the industrial capitalists

into mere money capitalists.    As  for  the  other  portion  of  profit,  which  is  not  intended  to  be

consumed as revenue, it is converted into money capital only when it

is not immediately able to find a place for investment in the expansion

of business in the productive sphere in which it has been made. This

may be due to two causes. Either because this sphere of production is

saturated  with  capital,  or  because  accumulation  must  first  reach  a

certain  volume  before  it  can  serve  as  capital,  depending  on  the

investment  magnitudes  of  new  capital  required  in  this  particular

sphere. Hence it is converted for a while into loanable money capital

and serves in the expansion of production in other spheres [...]

    The accumulation of loan capital consists simply in the fact that

money  is  precipitated  as  loanable  money.  This  process  is  very

different  from  an  actual  transformation  into  capital;  it  is  merely  the

accumulation of money in a form in which it can be transformed into

capital. But this accumulation can reflect, as we have shown, events

which are greatly different from actual accumulation. As long as actual

accumulation is continually expanding, this extended accumulation of

money  capital  may  be  partly  its  result,  partly  the  result  of

circumstances which accompany it but are quite different from it, and,

finally, even partly the result of impediments to actual accumulation. If

for no other reason than that accumulation of loan capital is inflated by

such  circumstances,  which  are  independent  of  actual  accumulation

but nevertheless accompany it, there must be a continuous plethora of

money capital in definite phases of the cycle and this plethora must

develop with the expansion of credit. And simultaneously with it, the

necessity of driving the production process beyond its capitalistic limits

must also develop: over-trade, overproduction, and excessive credit.

At the same time, this must always take place in forms that call forth a

reaction.

    As far as accumulation of money capital from ground rent, wages,

etc., is concerned, it is not necessary to discuss that matter here. Only

one aspect should be emphasized and that is that the business of

actual  saving  and  abstinence  (by  hoarders),  to  the  extent  that  it

furnishes  elements  of  accumulation,  is  left  by  the  division  of  labor,

which comes with the progress of capitalist production, to those who

receive the minimum of such elements, and who frequently enough

lose even their savings, as do the laborers when banks fail. On theone  hand,  the  capital  of  the  industrial  capitalist  is  not  "saved"  by

himself, but he has command of the savings of others in proportion to

the magnitude of his capital; on the other hand, the money capitalist

makes  of  the  savings  of  others  his  own  capital,  and  of  the  credit,

which the reproductive capitalists give to one another and which the

public gives to them, a private source for enriching himself. The last

illusion of the capitalist system, that capital is the fruit of one’s own

labor and savings, is thereby destroyed. Not only does profit consist in

the appropriation of other people’s labor, but the capital, with which

this labor of others is set in motion and exploited, consists of other

people’s property, which the money capitalist places at the disposal of

the industrial capitalists, and for which he in turn exploits the latter [...]

    In  the  discussion  on  interest-bearing  capital,  we  have  already

shown  that  the  average  interest  over  a  long  period  of  years,  other

conditions  remaining  equal,  is  determined  by  the  average  rate  of

profit; not profit of enterprise, which is nothing more than profit minus

interest [...]

    When the rate of interest stays up for a long time [...], it is prima

facie proof that the rate of profit is high during this period, but it does

not prove necessarily that the rate of profit of enterprise is high [... It] is

possible that this high rate of profit may leave only a low rate of profit

of enterprise, after the high rate of interest has been deducted. The

rate  of  profit  of  enterprise  may  shrink,  while  the  high  rate  of  profit

continues.  This  is  possible  because  the  enterprises  must  be

continued, once they have been started. During this phase, operations

are carried on to a large extent with pure credit capital (capital of other

people);  and  the  high  rate  of  profit  may  be  partly  speculative  and

prospective [...]

    If supply and demand of money capital, which determine the rate

of interest, were identical with supply and demand of actual capital, as

Overstone  maintains,  the  interest  would  be  simultaneously  low  and

high, depending on whether various commodities or various phases

(raw  material,  semi-finished  product,  finished  product)  of  the  same

commodity were being considered [...]      Chapter 31: The Medium of Circulation in The Credit System



    "The great regulator of the velocity of the currency is credit. This

explains why a severe pressure upon the money market is generally

coincident with a full circulation". (The Currency Theory Reviewed, p.

65.)

    This  is  to  be  taken  in  a  double  sense.  On  the  one  hand,  all

methods which save on medium of circulation are based upon credit.

On the other hand, however, take, for example, a 500-pound note. A

gives it to B on a certain day in payment for a bill of exchange; B

deposits it on the same day with his banker; the latter discounts a bill

of exchange with it on the very same day for C; C pays it to his bank,

the bank gives it to the bill-broker as an advance, etc. The velocity

with  which  the  note  circulates  here,  to  serve  for  purchases  and

payments, is effected by the velocity with which it repeatedly returns to

someone in the form of a deposit and passes over to someone else

again  in  the  form  of  a  loan.  The  pure  economy  in  medium  of

circulation appears most highly developed in the clearing house — in

the simple exchange of bills of exchange that are due — and in the

preponderant function of money as a means of payment for merely

settling balances. But the very existence of these bills of exchange

depends  in  turn  on  credit,  which  the  industrialists  and  merchants

mutually give one another. If this credit declines, so does the number

of  bills,  particularly  long-term  ones,  and  consequently  also  the

effectiveness of this method of balancing accounts. And this economy,

which  consists  in  eliminating  money  from  transactions  and  rests

entirely upon the function of money as a means of payment, which in

turn is based upon credit, can only be of two kinds (aside from the

more  or  less  developed  technique  in  the  concentration  of  these

payments):  mutual  claims,  represented  by  bills  of  exchange  or

cheques, are balanced out either by the same banker, who merely

transcribes the claim from the account of one to that of another, or by

the various bankers among themselves.    The concentration of 8 to 40 million bills of exchange in the hands

of one bill-broker, such as the firm of Overend, Gurney & Co., was one

of  the  principal  means  of  expanding  the  scale  of  such  balancing

locally.  The  effectiveness  of  the  medium  of  circulation  is  increased

through this economy in so far as a smaller quantity of it is required

simply  to  balance  accounts.  On  the  other  hand,  the  velocity  of  the

money  flowing  as  medium  of  circulation  (by  which  it  is  also

economized) depends entirely upon the flow of purchases and sales,

and on the chain of payments, in so far as they occur successively in

money.  But  credit  effects  and  thereby  increases  the  velocity  of

circulation. A single piece of money, for instance, can effect only five

moves, and remains longer in the hands of each individual as mere

medium of circulation without credit mediating — when A, its original

owner, buys from B, B from C, C from D, D from E, and E from F, that

is, when its transition from one hand to another is due only to actual

purchases  and  sales.  But  when  B  deposits  the  money  received  in

payment from A with his banker and the latter uses it in discounting

bills of exchange for C, C in turn buys from D, D deposits it with his

banker and the latter lends it to E, who buys from F, then even its

velocity  as  mere  medium  of  circulation  (means  of  purchase)  is

effected by several credit operations: B’s depositing with his banker

and the latter’s discounting for C, D’s depositing with his banker, and

the  latter’s  discounting  for  E;  in  other  words  through  four  credit

operations. Without these credit operations, the same piece of money

would not have performed five purchases successively in the given

period of time. The fact that it changed hands without mediation of

actual sales and purchases, through depositing and discounting, has

here  accelerated  its  change  of  hands  in  the  series  of  actual

transactions.

    We have seen previously that one and the same banknote can

constitute deposits in several banks. Similarly, it can also constitute

various deposits in the same bank. The banker discounts, with the

note which A has deposited, B’s bill of exchange, B pays C, and C

deposits the same note in the same bank that issued it.

    We have already demonstrated in the discussion of simple money

circulation (Buch I, Kap. III) that the mass of actual circulating money,

assuming  the  velocity  of  circulation  and  economy  of  payments  asgiven, is determined by the prices of commodities and the quantity of

transactions. The same law governs the circulation of notes [...]

    The absolute amount of circulation has a determining influence on

the rate of interest only in times of stringency. The demand for full

circulation can either reflect merely a demand for a hoarding medium

(disregarding the reduced velocity of the money circulation and the

continuous conversion of the same identical pieces of money into loan

capital) owing to lack of credit, as was the case in 1847 when the

suspension  of  the  Bank  Act  did  not  cause  any  expansion  of  the

circulation, but sufficed to draw forth the hoarded notes and to channel

them into circulation; or it may be that more means of circulation are

actually required under the circumstances, as was the case in 1857

when  the  circulation  actually  expanded  for  some  time  after  the

suspension of the Bank Act.

    Otherwise, the absolute quantity of circulation has no influence

whatever upon the rate of interest, since — assuming the economy

and velocity of currency to be constant — it is determined in the first

place by commodity prices and the quantity of transactions (whereby

one of these generally neutralizes the effect of the other), and finally

by the state of credit, whereas it by no means exerts the reverse effect

upon the latter; and, secondly, since commodity prices and interest do

not necessarily stand in any direct correlation to each other [...]

    The difference between the issue of circulating medium and the

lending  of  capital  is  best  demonstrated  in  the  actual  reproduction

process. We have seen (Book II, Part III) in what manner the different

component parts of production are exchanged for one another. For

example,  variable  capital  consists  materially  of  the  means  of

subsistence of the laborers, a portion of their own product. But this is

paid out to them piecemeal in money. The capitalist has to advance

this, and it is very greatly dependent on the credit system organization

whether he can pay out the new variable capital the following week

with the old money which he paid out in the previous week. The same

holds for exchange among various component parts of the total social

capital, for instance, between means of consumption and means of

production of means of consumption. The money for their circulation,

as we have seen, must be advanced by one or both of the exchanging

parties.  It  remains  thereupon  in  circulation,  but  returns  after  theexchange has been completed to the one who advanced it, since it

had  been  advanced  by  him  over  and  above  his  actually  employed

industrial capital (Book II, Chap. XX). Under a developed system of

credit, with the money concentrated in the hands of bankers, it is they,

at least nominally, who advance it. This advance refers only to money

in circulation. It is an advance of circulation, not an advance of capitals

which it circulates [...]

    The quantity of circulating bills of exchange, therefore, like that of

banknotes, is determined solely by the requirements of commerce; in

ordinary times, there circulated in the fifties in the United Kingdom, in

addition  to  39  million  in  banknotes,  about  300  million  in  bills  of

exchange  —  of  which  100-120  million  were  made  out  on  London

alone. The volume of circulating bills of exchange has no influence on

note circulation and is influenced by the latter only in times of money

tightness,  when  the  quantity  of  bills  increases  and  their  quality

deteriorates.  Finally,  in  a  period  of  crisis,  the  circulation  of  bills

collapses completely; nobody can make use of a promise to pay since

everyone will accept only cash payment; only the banknote retains, at

least thus far in England, its ability to circulate, because the nation

with its total wealth backs up the Bank of England [...]      PART 6: TRANSFORMATION OF SURPLUS PROFIT

                            INTO GROUND RENT                              Chapter 32: Introduction



    The analysis of landed property in its various historical forms is

beyond the scope of this work. We shall be concerned with it only in

so far as a portion of the surplus value produced by capital falls to the

share  of  the  landowner.  We  assume,  then,  that  agriculture  is

dominated by the capitalist mode of production just as manufacture is;

in other words, that agriculture is carried on by capitalists who differ

from other capitalists primarily in the manner in which their capital, and

the wage labor set in motion by this capital, are invested. So far as we

are concerned, the farmer produces wheat, etc., in much the same

way as the manufacturer produces yarn or machines. The assumption

that the capitalist mode of production has encompassed agriculture

implies  that  it  rules  over  all  spheres  of  production  and  bourgeois

society,  i.e.,  that  its  prerequisites,  such  as  free  competition  among

capitals, the possibility of transferring the latter from one production

sphere to another, and a uniform level of the average profit, etc., are

fully matured. The form of landed property which we shall consider

here  is  a  specifically  historical  one  a  form  transformed  through  the

influence of capital and of the capitalist mode of production, either of

feudal landownership, or of small-peasant agriculture as a means of

livelihood, in which the possession of the land and the soil constitutes

one of the prerequisites of production for the direct producer, and in

which  his  ownership  of  land  appears  as  the  most  advantageous

condition  for  the  prosperity  of  his  mode  of  production.  Just  as  the

capitalist mode of production in general is based on the expropriation

of the conditions of labor from the laborers, so does it in agriculture

presuppose the expropriation of the rural laborers from the land and

their subordination to a capitalist, who carries on agriculture for the

sake of profit. Thus, for the purpose of our analysis, the objection that

other forms of landed property and of agriculture have existed, or still

exist, is quite irrelevant. Such an objection can only apply to those

economists who treat the capitalist mode of production in agriculture,

and the form of landed property corresponding to it, not as historical

but rather as eternal categories.    For  our  purposes  it  is  necessary  to  study  the  modern  form  of

landed  property,  because  our  task  is  to  consider  the  specific

conditions  of  production  and  circulation  which  arise  from  the

investment of capital in agriculture. Without this, our analysis of capital

would not be complete. We therefore confine ourselves exclusively to

the investment of capital in agriculture itself, that is, in producing the

principal agricultural crop which feeds a given people. We can use

wheat  for  this  purpose,  because  it  is  the  principal  means  of

subsistence in modern capitalistically developed nations. (Or, instead

of agriculture, we can use mining because the laws are the same for

both.)

    One of the big contributions of Adam Smith was to have shown

that  ground  rent  for  capital  invested  in  the  production  of  such

agricultural products as flax and dye-stuffs, and in independent cattle-

raising, etc., is determined by the ground rent obtained from capital

invested in the production of the principal article of subsistence. In

fact, no further progress has been made in this regard since then. Any

limitations  or  additions  would  belong  in  an  independent  study  of

landed  property,  not  here.  Hence,  we  shall  not  speak  of  landed

property ex professo — in so far as it does not refer to land destined

for wheat production — but shall merely refer to it on occasion by way

of illustration.

    It  should  be  noted  for  the  sake  of  completeness  that  we  also

include water, etc., in the term land, in so far as it belongs to someone

as  an  accessory  to  the  land.  Landed  property  is  based  on  the

monopoly by certain persons over definite portions of the globe, as

exclusive spheres of their private will to the exclusion of all others.

With this in mind, the problem is to ascertain the economic value, that

is,  the  realization  of  this  monopoly  on  the  basis  of  capitalist

production. With the legal power of these persons to use or misuse

certain portions of the globe, nothing is decided. The use of this power

depends wholly upon economic conditions, which are independent of

their will. The legal view itself only means that the landowner can do

with  the  land  what  every  owner  of  commodities  can  do  with  his

commodities. And this view, this legal view of free private ownership of

land, arises in the ancient world only with the dissolution of the organic

order of society, and in the modern world only with the development ofcapitalist production. It has been imported by Europeans to Asia only

here and there.

    In the section dealing with primitive accumulation (Buch I, Kap.

XXIV), we saw that this mode of production presupposes, on the one

hand,  the  separation  of  the  direct  producers  from  their  position  as

mere accessories to the land (in the form of vassals, serfs, slaves,

etc.), and, on the other hand, the expropriation of the mass of the

people from the land. To this extent the monopoly of landed property

is  a  historical  premise,  and  continues  to  remain  the  basis  of  the

capitalist  mode  of  production,  just  as  in  all  previous  modes  of

production which are based on the exploitation of the masses in one

form  or  another.  But  the  form  of  landed  property  with  which  the

incipient capitalist mode of production is confronted does not suit it. It

first creates for itself the form required by subordinating agriculture to

capital. It thus transforms feudal landed property, clan property, small

peasant property in mark communes — no matter how divergent their

juristic forms may be — into the economic form corresponding to the

requirements of this mode of production. One of the major results of

the capitalist mode of production is that, on the one hand, it transforms

agriculture  from  a  mere  empirical  and  mechanical  self-perpetuating

process  employed  by  the  least  developed  part  of  society  into  the

conscious scientific application of agronomy, in so far as this is at all

feasible under conditions of private property; that it divorces landed

property  from  the  relations  of  dominion  and  servitude,  on  the  one

hand, and, on the other, totally separates land as an instrument of

production from landed property and landowner — for whom the land

merely represents a certain money assessment which he collects by

virtue  of  his  monopoly  from  the  industrial  capitalist,  the  capitalist

farmer;  it  dissolves  the  connection  between  landownership  and  the

land  so  thoroughly  that  the  landowner  may  spend  his  whole  life  in

Constantinople, while his estates lie in Scotland.

    Landed  property  thus  receives  its  purely  economic  form  by

discarding  all  its  former  political  and  social  embellishments  and

associations,  in  brief  all  those  traditional  accessories,  which  are

denounced, as we shall see later, as useless and absurd superfluities

by  the  industrial  capitalists  themselves,  as  well  as  their  theoretical

spokesmen,  in  the  heat  of  their  struggle  with  landed  property.  Therationalizing of agriculture, on the one hand, which makes it for the

first time capable of operating on a social scale, and the reduction ad

absurdum  of  property  in  land,  on  the  other,  are  the  great

achievements of the capitalist mode of production. Like all of its other

historical  advances,  it  also  attained  these  by  first  completely

impoverishing the direct producers.

    Before we proceed to the problem itself, several more preliminary

remarks are necessary to avoid misunderstanding.

    The prerequisites for the capitalist mode of production therefore

are  the  following:  The  actual  tillers  of  the  soil  are  wage  laborers

employed  by  a  capitalist,  the  capitalist  farmer  who  is  engaged  in

agriculture merely as a particular field of exploitation for capital, as

investment  for  his  capital  in  a  particular  sphere  of  production.  This

capitalist farmer pays the landowner, the owner of the land exploited

by  him,  a  sum  of  money  at  definite  periods  fixed  by  contract,  for

instance, annually (just as the borrower of money capital pays a fixed

interest), for the right to invest his capital in this specific sphere of

production.  This  sum  of  money  is  called  ground  rent,  no  matter

whether  it  is  paid  for  agricultural  land,  building  lots,  mines,  fishing

grounds,  or  forests,  etc.  It  is  paid  for  the  entire  time  for  which  the

landowner  has  contracted  to  rent  his  land  to  the  capitalist  farmer.

Ground rent, therefore, is here that form in which property in land is

realized economically, that is, produces value. Here, then, we have all

three classes — wage laborers, industrial capitalists, and landowners

constituting together, and in their mutual opposition, the framework of

modern society.

    Capital  may  be  fixed  in  the  land,  incorporated  in  it  either  in  a

transitory  manner,  as  through  improvements  of  a  chemical  nature,

fertilization, etc., or more permanently, as in drainage canals, irrigation

works, leveling, farm buildings, etc. Elsewhere I have called the capital

thus applied to land la terre-capital. It belongs to the category of fixed

capital.  The  interest  on  capital  incorporated  in  the  land  and  the

improvements  thus  made  in  it  as  an  instrument  of  production  can

constitute  a  part  of  the  rent  paid  by  the  capitalist  farmer  to  the

landowner, but it does not constitute the actual ground rent, which is

paid for the use of the land as such — be it in a natural or cultivated

state. In a systematic treatment of landed property, which is not withinour  scope,  this  part  of  the  landowner’s  revenue  would  have  to  be

discussed at length. But a few words about it will suffice here. The

more  transitory  capital  investments,  which  accompany  the  ordinary

production processes in agriculture, are all made without exception by

the  capitalist  farmer.  These  investments,  like  cultivation  proper  in

general, improve the land, increase its output, and transform the land

from mere material into land-capital when the cultivation is carried on

more or less rationally, i.e., when it is not reduced to a brutal spoliation

of the soil, as was in vogue, e.g., among the former slave-holders in

the  United  States;  however,  the  gentlemen  landowners  secure

themselves  against  such  practice  by  contract.  A  cultivated  field  is

worth more than an uncultivated one of the same natural quality.

    The  more  permanent  fixed  capital  investments,  which  are

incorporated in the soil and used up in a longer period of time, are

also in the main, and in some spheres often exclusively, made by the

capitalist farmer. But as soon as the time stipulated by contract has

expired — and this is one of the reasons why with the development of

capitalist  production  the  landowners  seek  to  shorten  the  contract

period as much as possible — the improvements incorporated in the

soil become the property of the landowner as an inseparable feature

of the substance, the land. In the new contract made by the landowner

he adds the interest for capital incorporated in the land to the ground

rent itself. And he does this whether he now leases the land to the

capitalist  farmer  who  made  these  improvements  or  to  some  other

farmer. His rent is thus inflated; and should he wish to sell his land (we

shall see immediately how its price is determined), its value is now

higher. He sells not merely the land but the improved land, the capital

incorporated in the land for which he paid nothing.

    Quite aside from the movements of ground rent itself, here lies

one of the secrets of the increasing enrichment of landowners, the

continuous inflation of their rents, and the constantly growing money

value of their estates along with progress in economic development.

Thus  they  pocket  a  product  of  social  development  created  without

their help — fruges consumere nati. But this is at the same time one of

the greatest obstacles to a rational development of agriculture, for the

tenant  farmer  avoids  all  improvements  and  outlays  for  which  he

cannot expect complete returns during the term of his lease. We findthis situation denounced as such an obstacle again and again, not

only in the 18th century by James Anderson, the actual discoverer of

the modern theory of rent — who was also a practical capitalist farmer

and an advanced agronomist for his time — but also in our own day

by opponents of the present constitution of landed property in England

[...]

    In agriculture proper this process does not yet appear quite as

plainly  as  when  the  land  is  used  for  building  purposes.  By  far  the

largest portion of land used in England for building purposes but not

sold  as  a  freehold  is  leased  by  the  landowners  for  99  years  or,  if

possible, for a shorter term. After the lapse of this period the buildings

fall into the hands of the landowner together with the land itself [...]

    This illustration of ownership in buildings is important. In the first

place, it clearly shows the difference between actual ground rent and

interest on fixed capital incorporated in the land, which may constitute

an addition to ground rent. Interest on buildings, like that on capital

incorporated  in  the  land  by  the  tenant  in  agriculture,  falls  into  the

hands of the industrial capitalist, the building speculator, or the tenant,

so long as the lease lasts, and has in itself nothing to do with ground

rent, which must be paid on stated dates annually for the use of the

land. Secondly, it shows that capital incorporated in the land by others

ultimately passes into the hands of the landlord together with the land,

and that the interest for it inflates his rent.

    Some  writers,  acting  either  as  spokesmen  of  landlordism  and

taking up the cudgels against the attacks of bourgeois economists, or

in an endeavor to transform the capitalist system of production from a

system  of  contradictions  into  one  of  "harmonies",  like  Carey,  have

tried  to  represent  ground  rent,  the  specific  economic  expression  of

landed property, as identical with interest. This would eliminate the

opposition  between  landlords  and  capitalists.  The  opposite  method

was  employed  in  the  early  stages  of  capitalist  production.  In  those

days, landed property was still regarded by popular conception as the

pristine  and  respectable  form  of  private  property,  while  interest  on

capital  was  decried  as  usury.  Dudley  North,  Locke  and  others,

therefore,  represented  interest  on  capital  as  a  form  analogous  to

ground rent, just as Turgot deduced the justification for interest from

the existence of ground rent. — Aside from the fact that ground rentmay, and does, exist in its pure form without any addition for interest

on capital incorporated in the land, those more recent writers forget

that,  in  this  way,  the  landlord  not  only  receives  interest  on  other

persons’ capital that costs him nothing, but also pockets this capital of

others without recompense. The justification of landed property, like

that of all other forms of property corresponding to a certain mode of

production, is that the mode of production itself is a transient historical

necessity, and this includes the relations of production and exchange

which  stem  from  it.  It  is  true,  as  we  shall  see  later,  that  landed

property  differs  from  other  kinds  of  property  in  that  it  appears

superfluous and harmful at a certain stage of development, even from

the point of view of the capitalist mode of production.

    Ground rent may in another form be confused with interest and

thereby its specific character overlooked. Ground rent assumes the

form of a certain sum of money, which the landlord draws annually by

leasing  a  certain  plot  on  our  planet.  We  have  seen  that  every

particular sum of money may be capitalized, that is, considered as the

interest on an imaginary capital. For instance, if the average rate of

interest is 5%, then an annual ground rent of £200 may be regarded

as  interest  on  a  capital  of  £4,000.  Ground  rent  so  capitalized

constitutes the purchase price or value of the land, a category which

like the price of labor is prima facie irrational, since the earth is not the

product of labor and therefore has no value. But on the other hand, a

real relation in production is concealed behind this irrational form. If a

capitalist buys land yielding a rent of £200 annually and pays £4,000

for it, then he draws the average annual interest of 5% on his capital

of £4,000, just as if he had invested this capital in interest-bearing

papers or loaned it directly at 5% interest. It is the expansion of a

capital of £4,000 at 5%. On this assumption, he would recover the

purchase price of his estate through its revenues in twenty years. In

England, therefore, the purchase price of land is calculated in so many

years’  purchase  which  is  merely  another  way  of  expressing  the

capitalization of ground rent. It is in fact the purchase price — not of

the  land,  but  of  the  ground  rent  yielded  by  it  —  calculated  in

accordance with the usual interest rate. But this capitalization of rent

assumes the existence of rent, while rent cannot inversely be derivedand explained from its own capitalization. Its existence, independent

of its sale, is rather the starting-point for the inquiry.

    It follows, then, that the price of land may rise or fall inversely as

the  interest  rate  rises  or  falls  if  we  assume  ground  rent  to  be  a

constant magnitude. If the ordinary interest rate should fall from 5% to

4%, then the annual ground rent of £200 would represent the annual

realization from a capital of £5,000 instead of £4,000. The price of the

same piece of land would thus have risen from £4,000 to £5,000, or

from 20 years’ to 25 years’ purchase. The converse would take place

in the opposite case. This is a movement of the price of land which is

independent of the movement of ground rent itself and regulated only

by the interest rate. But as we have seen that the rate of profit has a

tendency to fall in the course of social progress, and, therefore, the

interest rate has the same tendency, so far as it is regulated by the

rate of profit; and that, furthermore, the interest rate shows a tendency

to fall in consequence of the growth of loanable capital, apart from the

influence of the rate of profit, it follows that the price of land has a

tendency to rise, even independently of the movement of ground rent

and the prices of the products of the land, of which rent constitutes a

part.

    The confusion of ground rent itself with the interest from which it

assumes  for  the  buyer  of  the  land  —  a  confusion  resulting  from

complete  lack  of  familiarity  with  the  nature  of  ground  rent  —  must

necessarily  lead  to  the  most  absurd  conclusions.  Since  landed

property is considered in all ancient countries as a particularly genteel

form of property, and its purchase also as an eminently safe capital

investment,  the  interest  rate  at  which  ground  rent  is  bought  is

generally lower than that of other long-term investments of capital, so

that  a  buyer  of  real  estate  draws,  for  instance,  only  4%  on  his

purchase price, whereas he would draw 5% for the same capital in

other investments. In other words, he pays more capital for ground

rent than he would for the same annual amount of income from other

investments. This leads Mr. Thiers to conclude in his generally very

poor  work  on La  Propriété  (a  reprint  of  his  speech  in  the  French

National  Assembly  in  1849  directed  against  Proudhon)  that  ground

rent is low, whereas it merely proves that its purchase price is high [...]    In practice, naturally, everything appears as ground rent that is

paid as lease money by tenant to landlord for the right to cultivate the

soil. No matter what the composition of this tribute and no matter what

its sources, it has this in common with the actual ground rent — that

the monopoly of the so-called landed proprietor of a portion of our

planet  enables  him  to  levy  such  tribute  and  impose  such  an

assessment. It has this in common with the actual ground rent — that

it determines the price of land, which, as we have indicated earlier, is

nothing but the capitalized income from the lease of the land.

    We have already seen that interest for the capital incorporated in

the land may constitute such an extraneous component of ground rent

[...] But aside from this interest, it is possible that the lease money

may  conceal  in  part,  and  in  certain  cases  in  its  entirety,  i.e.,  in

complete  absence  of  the  actual  ground  rent  when  the  land  is,

therefore, actually worthless — a deduction from the average profit or

from  the  normal  wages,  or  both.  This  portion,  whether  of  profit  or

wages, appears here as ground rent, because instead of falling to the

industrial  capitalist  or  the  wage  worker,  as  would  normally  be  the

case,  it  is  paid  to  the  landlord  in  the  form  of  lease  money.

Economically speaking, neither the one nor the other of these portions

constitutes ground rent; but, in practice, it constitutes the landlord's

revenue,  an  economic  realization  of  his  monopoly,  much  as  actual

ground rent, and it has just as determining an influence on land prices

[...]

    We are not speaking now of conditions in which ground rent, the

manner  of  expressing  landed  property  in  the  capitalist  mode  of

production, formally exists without the existence of the capitalist mode

of production itself, i.e., without the tenant himself being an industrial

capitalist, nor the type of his management being a capitalist one. Such

is  the  case,  e.g.,  in  Ireland.  The  tenant  there  is  generally  a  small

farmer. What he pays to the landlord in the form of rent frequently

absorbs not merely a part of his profit, that is, his own surplus labor (to

which he is entitled as possessor of his own instruments of labor), but

also a part of his normal wage, which he would otherwise receive for

the same amount of labor. Besides, the landlord, who does nothing at

all for the improvement of the land, also expropriates his small capital,which the tenant for the most part incorporates in the land through his

own labor [...]

    Nor are we referring to exceptional circumstances in which the

landlord may enforce a high rental — even in countries with capitalist

production — that stands in no relation to the yield from the soil. Of

such a nature, for example, is the leasing of small patches of land to

laborers  in  English  factory  districts,  either  as  small  gardens  or  for

amateur spare-time farming. (Reports of Inspectors of Factories.)

    We  are  referring  to  ground  rent  in  countries  with  developed

capitalist production. Among English tenants, for instance, there are a

number  of  small  capitalists  who  are  destined  and  compelled  by

education, training, tradition, competition, and other circumstances to

invest  their  capital  as  tenants  in  agriculture.  They  are  forced  to  be

satisfied with less than the average profit, and to turn over part of it to

the landlords as rent. This is the only condition under which they are

permitted  to  invest  their  capital  in  the  land,  in  agriculture.  Since

landlords  everywhere  exert  considerable,  and  in  England  even

overwhelming,  influence  on  legislation,  they  are  able  to  exploit  this

situation for the purpose of victimizing the entire class of tenants [...]

    A  much  more  general  and  important  fact,  however,  is  the

depression  of  the  actual  farm  laborer’s  wage  below  its  normal

average, so that part of it is deducted to become part of the lease

money and thus, in the guise of ground rent, it flows into the pocket of

the  landlord  rather  than  the  laborer.  This  is,  for  example,  quite

generally the case in England and Scotland, with the exception of a

few favorably situated counties [...]

    [It] should be borne in mind in considering the various forms of

manifestation of ground rent, that is, the lease money paid under the

heading  of  ground  rent  to  the  landlord  for  the  use  of  the  land  for

purposes of production or consumption, that the price of things which

have in themselves no value, i.e., are not the product of labor, such as

land,  or  which  at  least  cannot  be  reproduced  by  labor,  such  as

antiques and works of art by certain masters, etc., may be determined

by many fortuitous combinations. In order to sell a thing, nothing more

is required than its capacity to be monopolized and alienated.

    There are three main errors to be avoided in studying ground rent,

and which obscure its analysis.    1)  Confusing  the  various  forms  of  rent  pertaining  to  different

stages of development of the social production process.

    Whatever the specific form of rent may be, all types have this in

common:  the  appropriation  of  rent  is  that  economic  form  in  which

landed property is realized, and ground rent, in turn, presupposes the

existence of landed property, the ownership of certain portions of our

planet  by  certain  individuals.  The  owner  may  be  an  individual

representing  the  community,  as  in  Asia,  Egypt,  etc.;  or  this  landed

property may be merely incidental to the ownership of the immediate

producers  themselves  by  some  individual  as  under  slavery  or

serfdom; or it may be a purely private ownership of Nature by non-

producers, a mere title to land; or, finally, it may be a relationship to

the land which, as in the case of colonists and small peasants owning

land, seems to be directly included — in the isolated and not socially

developed labor — in the appropriation and production of the products

of particular plots of land by the direct producers.

    This common element in the various forms of rent, namely that of

being the economic realization of landed property, of legal fiction by

grace of which certain individuals have an exclusive right to certain

parts of our planet — makes it possible for the differences to escape

detection.

    2) All ground rent is surplus value, the product of surplus labor. In

its  undeveloped  form  as  rent  in  kind  it  is  still  directly  the  surplus

product itself. Hence, the mistaken idea that the rent corresponding to

the capitalist mode of production — which is always a surplus over

and  above  profit,  i.e.,  above  a  value  portion  of  commodities  which

itself consists of surplus value (surplus labor) — that this special and

specific component of surplus value is explained by merely explaining

the general conditions for the existence of surplus value and profit in

general. These conditions are: the direct producers must work beyond

the  time  necessary  for  reproducing  their  own  labor  power,  for  their

own reproduction. They must perform surplus labor in general. This is

the subjective condition. The objective condition is that they must be

able to perform surplus labor. The natural conditions must be such

that a part of their available labor time suffices for their reproduction

and  self-maintenance  as  producers,  that  the  production  of  theirnecessary means of subsistence shall not consume their whole labor

power.

    The fertility of Nature establishes a limit here, a starting-point, a

basis. On the other hand, the development of the social productive

power  of  their  labor  forms  the  other  limit.  Examined  more  closely,

since the production of means of subsistence is the very first condition

of their existence and of all production in general, labor used in this

production, that is, agricultural labor in the broadest economic sense,

must be fruitful enough so as not to absorb the entire available labor

time  in  the  production  of  means  of  subsistence  for  the  direct

producers, that is, agricultural surplus labor and therefore agricultural

surplus  product  must  be  possible.  Developed  further,  the  total

agricultural labor, both necessary and surplus labor, of a segment of

society  must  suffice  to  produce  the  necessary  subsistence  for  the

whole of society, that is, for non-agricultural laborers too. This means

therefore  that  the  major  division  of  labor  between  agricultural  and

industrial  must  be  possible;  and  similarly  between  tillers  of  the  soil

producing means of subsistence and those producing raw materials.

Although the labor of the direct producers of means of subsistence

breaks up into necessary and surplus labor as far as they themselves

are  concerned,  it  represents  from  the  social  standpoint  only  the

necessary  labor  required  to  produce  the  means  of  subsistence.

Incidentally, the same is true for all division of labor within society as a

whole,  as  distinct  from  the  division  of  labor  within  individual

workshops. It is the labor necessary for the production of particular

articles,  for  the  satisfaction  of  some  particular  need  of  society  for

these  particular  articles.  If  this  division  is  proportional,  then  the

products of various groups are sold at their values (at a later stage of

development they are sold at their prices of production), or at prices

which are certain modifications of these values or prices of production

determined by general laws. It is indeed the effect of the law of value,

not with reference to individual commodities or articles, but to each

total  product  of  the  particular  social  spheres  of  production  made

independent by the division of labor; so that not only is no more than

the necessary labor time used up for each specific commodity, but

only the necessary proportional quantity of the total social labor time is

used up in the various groups.    For  the  condition  remains  that  the  commodity  represents  use

value.  But  if  the  use  value  of  individual  commodities  depends  on

whether they satisfy a particular need then the use value of the mass

of the social product depends on whether it satisfies the quantitatively

definite social need for each particular kind of product in an adequate

manner, and whether the labor is therefore proportionately distributed

among the different spheres in keeping with these social needs, which

are  quantitatively  circumscribed.  (This  point  is  to  be  noted  in  the

distribution of capital among the various spheres of production.) The

social need, that is, the use value on a social scale, appears here as a

determining factor for the amount of total social labor time which is

expended in various specific spheres of production. But it is merely

the  same  law  which  is  already  applied  in  the  case  of  single

commodities, namely, that the use value of a commodity is the basis

of its exchange value and thus of its value. This point has a bearing

upon the relationship between necessary and surplus labor only in so

far as a violation of this proportion makes it impossible to realize the

value of the commodity and thus the surplus value contained in it.

    For instance; let us assume that proportionally too much cotton

goods have been produced, although only the labor time necessary

under  the  prevailing  conditions  is  incorporated  in  this  total  cloth

production. But in general too much social labor has been expended

in  this  particular  line;  in  other  words,  a  portion  of  this  product  is

useless. It is therefore sold solely as if it had been produced in the

necessary  proportion.  This  quantitative  limit  to  the  quota  of  social

labor time available for the various particular spheres of production is

but  a  more  developed  expression  of  the  law  of  value  in  general,

although the necessary labor time assumes a different meaning here.

Only just so much of it is required for the satisfaction of social needs.

The limitation occurring here is due to the use value. Society can use

only so much of its total labor time for this particular kind of product

under  prevailing  conditions  of  production.  But  the  subjective  and

objective conditions of surplus labor and surplus value in general have

nothing to do with the particular form of either the profit or the rent.

These  conditions  apply  to  surplus  value  as  such,  no  matter  what

special form it may assume. Hence they do not explain ground rent.    3) It is precisely in the economic realization of landed property, in

the  development  of  ground  rent,  that  the  following  characteristic

peculiarity comes to the fore, namely that its amount is by no means

determined by the actions of its recipient, but is determined rather by

the  independent  development  of  social  labor  in  which  the  recipient

takes  no  part.  It  may  easily  happen,  therefore,  that  something  is

regarded as a peculiarity of rent (and of the products of agriculture in

general),  which  is  really  a  common  feature  of  all  branches  of

production  and  all  their  products  where  the  basis  is  commodity

production — and, in particular, capitalist production, which is in its

entirety commodity production [...]

    It is in the nature of capitalist production to continually reduce the

agricultural population as compared with the non-agricultural, because

in  industry  (in  the  strict  sense)  the  increase  of  constant  capital  in

relation  to  variable  capital  goes  hand  in  hand  with  an  absolute

increase, though relative decrease, in variable capital; on the other

hand, in agriculture the variable capital required for the exploitation of

a certain plot of land decreases absolutely; it can thus only increase to

the  extent  that  new  land  is  taken  into  cultivation,  but  this  again

requires as a prerequisite a still greater growth of the non-agricultural

population [...]

    Rent can develop as money rent only on the basis of commodity

production, in particular capitalist production, and it develops to the

same  extent  that  agricultural  production  becomes  commodity

production, that is, to the same extent that non-agricultural production

develops independently of agricultural production, for to that degree

the  agricultural  product  becomes  commodity,  exchange  value,  and

value. In so far as commodity production and thus the production of

value  develops  with  capitalist  production  so  does  the  production  of

surplus value and surplus product. But in the same proportion as the

latter develops, landed property acquires the capacity of capturing an

ever-increasing  portion  of  this  surplus  value  by  means  of  its  land

monopoly and thereby, of raising the value of its rent and the price of

the land itself. The capitalist still performs an active function in the

development  of  this  surplus  value  and  surplus  product.  But  the

landowner  need  only  appropriate  the  growing  share  in  the  surplusproduct and the surplus value, without having contributed anything to

this growth [...]

    Therefore,  if,  on  the  one  hand,  surplus  value  or,  still  more

narrowly, the surplus product in general is explained instead of rent,

the mistake is made, on the other hand, of ascribing exclusively to

agricultural products a characteristic which belongs to all products in

their capacity as commodities and values. This is vulgarized still more

by those who pass from the general determination of value over to the

rea1isation of the value of a specific commodity. Every commodity can

realize  its  value  only  in  the  process  of  circulation,  and  whether  it

realizes its value, or to what extent it does so, depends on prevailing

market conditions.

    It  is  not  a  singularity  of  ground  rent,  then,  that  agricultural

products develop into, and as, values, i.e., that they confront other

commodities  as  commodities,  and  that  non-agricultural  products

confront  them  as  commodities;  or  that  they  develop  as  specific

expressions of social labor. The singularity of ground rent is rather that

together with the conditions in which agricultural products develop as

values (commodities), and together with the conditions in which their

values are realized, there also grows the power of landed property to

appropriate an increasing portion of these values, which were created

without its assistance; and so an increasing portion of surplus value is

transformed into ground rent.              Chapter 33: Differential Rent. General Remarks



    In the analysis of ground rent we shall begin with the assumption

that products paying such a rent, products in which a portion of the

surplus value, and therefore also a portion of the total price, resolves

itself into ground rent, i.e., that agricultural as well as mining products

are  sold  at  their  prices  of  production  like  all  other  commodities.  (It

suffices  for  our  purposes  to  confine  ourselves  to  agricultural  and

mining products.) In other words, their selling prices are made up of

the  elements  of  their  cost  (the  value  of  consumed  constant  and

variable capital) plus a profit determined by the general rate of profit

and calculated on the total advanced capital, whether consumed or

not. We assume, then, that average selling prices of these products

are equal to their prices of production. The question now arises how it

is possible for ground rent to develop under these conditions, i.e., how

it is possible for a portion of the profit to become transformed into

ground  rent,  so  that  a  portion  of  the  commodity  price  falls  to  the

landlord.

    In  order  to  demonstrate  the  general  character  of  this  form  of

ground  rent,  let  us  assume  that  most  of  the  factories  of  a  certain

country  derive  their  power  from  steam-engines,  while  a  smaller

number derive it from natural waterfalls. Let us further assume that the

price  of  production  in  the  former  amounts  to  115  for  a  quantity  of

commodities which have consumed a capital of 100. The 15% profit is

calculated not solely on the consumed capital of 100, but on the total

capital employed in the production of this commodity value. We have

previously shown that this price of production is not determined by the

individual  cost  price  of  every  single  industrial  producer,  but  by  the

average  cost  price  of  the  commodity  under  average  conditions  of

capital in the entire sphere of production. It is, in fact, the market price

of production, the average market price as distinct from its oscillations.

It is in general in the form of the market price, and, furthermore, in the

form of the regulating market price, or market price of production, thatthe nature of the value of commodities asserts itself, its determination

not by the labor time necessary in the case of any individual producer

for the production of a certain quantity of commodities, or of some

individual commodity, but by the socially necessary labor time; that is,

by the labor time, required for the production of the socially necessary

total quantity of commodity varieties on the market under the existing

average conditions of social production.

    As definite figures are immaterial in this case, we shall assume

furthermore that the cost price in factories run on water-power is only

90 instead of 100. Since the regulating market price of production of

this  quantity  of  commodities  =  115,  with  a  profit  of  15%,  the

manufacturers who operate their machines on water power will also

sell  their  commodities  at  115,  i.e.,  the  average  price  regulating  the

market  price.  Their  profit  would  then  be  25  instead  of  15;  the

regulating price of production would allow them a surplus profit of 10%

not because they sell their commodities above the price of production,

but because they sell them at the price of production, because their

commodities  are  produced,  or  their  capital  operates,  under

exceptionally  favorable  conditions,  i.e.,  under  conditions  which  are

more favorable than the average prevailing in this sphere.

    Two things become evident at once:

    First,  the  surplus  profit  of  the  producers  who  use  a  natural

waterfall as motive power is to begin with in the same class with all

surplus  profit  (and  we  have  already  analyzed  this  category  when

discussing prices of production) which is not the fortuitous result of

transactions in the circulation process, of the fortuitous fluctuations in

market  prices.  This  surplus  profit,  then,  is  likewise  equal  to  the

difference between the individual price of production of these favored

producers  and  the  general  social  price  of  production  regulating  the

market in this entire production sphere. This difference is equal to the

excess of the general price of production of the commodities over their

individual price of production. The two regulating limits of this excess

are, on the one hand, the individual cost price, and thus the individual

price  of  production,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  the  general  price  of

production. The value of commodities produced with water-power is

smaller because a smaller total quantity of labor is required for theirproduction, i.e., less labor — in materialized form — enters into the

constant capital as part of the latter [...]

    Secondly, thus far, the surplus profit of the manufacturer using

natural water-power instead of steam does not differ in any way from

any other surplus profit. All normal surplus profit, that is, all surplus

profit  not  due  to  fortuitous  sales  or  market  price  fluctuations  is

determined  by  the  difference  between  the  individual  price  of

production of the commodities of a particular capital and the general

price  of  production,  which  regulates  the  market  prices  of  the

commodities produced by the capital in this sphere of production in

general, or, in other words, the market prices of commodities of the

total capital invested in this sphere of production.

    But now we come to the difference.

    To what circumstance does the industrial capitalist in the present

case owe his surplus profit, the surplus resulting for him personally

from the price of production regulated by the general rate of profit?

    He owes it in the first instance to a natural force — the motive

power of the waterfall — which is found readily available in Nature and

is not itself a product of labor like the coal which transforms water into

steam.  The  coal,  therefore,  has  value,  must  be  paid  for  by  an

equivalent, and has a cost. The waterfall is a natural production agent

in the production of which no labor enters.

    But this is not all. The manufacturer who operates with steam also

employs  natural  forces  which  cost  him  nothing  yet  make  the  labor

more productive and increase the surplus value and thereby the profit,

inasmuch  as  they  thus  cheapen  the  manufacture  of  the  means  of

subsistence required for the laborers. These natural forces are thus

quite as much monopolized by capital as the social natural forces of

labor  arising  from  co-operation,  division  of  labor,  etc.  The

manufacturer pays for coal, but not for the capacity of water to alter its

physical state, to turn into steam, not for the elasticity of the steam,

etc. This monopolization of natural forces, that is, of the increase in

labor power produced by them, is common to all capital operating with

steam-engines.  It  may  increase  that  portion  of  the  product  of  labor

which  represents  surplus  value  in  relation  to  that  portion  which  is

transformed into wages. In so far as it does this, it raises the general

rate of profit, but it does not create any surplus profit, for this consistsof the excess of individual profit over average profit. The fact that the

application of a natural force, a waterfall, creates surplus profit in this

case,  cannot  therefore  be  due  solely  to  the  circumstance  that  the

increased productivity of labor here results from the application of a

natural force. Other modifying circumstances are necessary.

      Conversely.  The  mere  application  of  natural  forces  in  industry

may influence the level of the general rate of profit because it affects

the  quantity  of  labor  required  to  produce  the  necessary  means  of

subsistence.  But  in  itself  it  does  not  create  any  deviation  from  the

general rate of profit, and this is precisely the point in which we are

interested here. Furthermore, the surplus profit which some individual

capital otherwise realizes in a particular sphere of production — for

deviations of the rates of profit in various spheres of production are

continually balanced out into an average rate — is due, aside from

fortuitous deviations, to a reduction in cost price, in production costs.

This reduction arises either from the fact that capital is used in greater

than average quantities, so that faux frais of production are reduced,

while  the  general  causes  increasing  the  productiveness  of  labor

(cooperation, division of labor, etc.) can become effective to a higher

degree, with more intensity, because their field of activity has become

larger; or it may arise from the fact that, aside from the amount of

functioning capital, better methods of labor, new inventions, improved

machinery,  chemical  manufacturing  secrets,  etc.,  in  short,  new  and

improved, better than average means of production and methods of

production are used. The reduction in cost price and the surplus profit

arising  from  it  are  here  the  result  of  the  manner  in  which  the

functioning capital is invested. They result either from the fact that the

capital is concentrated in the hands of one person in extraordinarily

large quantities (a condition that is cancelled out as soon as equal

magnitudes of capital are used on the average), or from the fact that a

certain  magnitude  of  capital  functions  in  a  particularly  productive

manner  (a  condition  that  disappears  as  soon  as  the  exceptional

method of production becomes general or is surpassed by a still more

developed one).

    The cause of the surplus profit, then, arises here from the capital

itself (which includes the labor set in motion by it) whether it be due to

the  greater  magnitude  of  capital  employed  or  to  its  more  efficientapplication; and, as a matter of fact, there is no particular reason why

all capital in the same production sphere should not be invested in the

same  manner.  On  the  contrary,  the  competition  between  capitals

tends to cancel these differences more and more. The determination

of value by the socially necessary labor time asserts itself through the

cheapening  of  commodities  and  the  compulsion  to  produce

commodities  under  the  same  favorable  conditions.  But  matters  are

different with the surplus profit of an industrial capitalist who makes

use of the waterfall. The increased productiveness of the labor used

by him comes neither from the capital and labor itself, nor from the

mere application of some natural force different from capital and labor

but  incorporated  in  the  capital.  It  arises  from  the  greater  natural

productiveness of labor bound up with the application of a force of

Nature, but not a force of Nature that is at the command of all capital

in  the  same  sphere  of  production,  as  for  example  the  elasticity  of

steam. In other words, its application is not to be taken for granted

whenever capital is generally invested in this sphere of production.

    On the contrary, it is a monopolizable force of Nature which, like

the  waterfall,  is  only  at  the  command  of  those  who  have  at  their

disposal particular portions of the earth and its appurtenances. It is by

no means within the power of capital to call into existence this natural

premise for a greater productivity of labor in the same manner as any

capital  may  transform  water  into  steam.  It  is  found  only  locally  in

Nature and, wherever it does not exist, it cannot be established by a

definite investment of capital. It is not bound to goods which labor can

produce, such as machines and coal, but to specific natural conditions

prevailing in certain portions of land. Those manufacturers who own

waterfalls  exclude  those  who  do  not  from  using  this  natural  force,

because  land,  and  particularly  land  endowed  with  water-power,  is

scarce [...] Now let us assume that the waterfalls, along with the land

to which they belong, are held by individuals who are regarded as

owners of these portions of the earth, i.e., who are landowners.

    These owners prevent the investment of capital in the waterfalls

and  their  exploitation  by  capital.  They  can  permit  or  forbid  such

utilization. But a waterfall cannot be created by capital out of itself.

Therefore, the surplus profit which arises from the employment of this

waterfall is not due to capital, but to the utilization of a natural forcewhich can be monopolized, and has been monopolized, by capital.

Under  these  circumstances,  the  surplus  profit  is  transformed  into

ground rent, that is, it falls into possession of the owner of a waterfall.

If the manufacturer pays the owner of a waterfall £10 annually, then

his profit is £15, that is, 15% on the £100 which then make up his cost

of production; and he is just as well or possibly better off than all other

capitalists  in  his  sphere  of  production  who  operate  with  steam.  It

would not alter matters one bit if the capitalist himself should be the

owner of a waterfall. He would, in such a case, pocket as before the

surplus profit of £10 in his capacity as waterfall owner, and not in his

capacity  as  capitalist;  and  precisely  because  this  surplus  does  not

stem from his capital as such, but rather from the control of a limited

natural force distinct from his capital which can be monopolized, is it

transformed into ground rent.

    First, it is evident that this rent is always a differential rent, for it

does  not  enter  as  a  determining  factor  into  the  general  production

price of commodities, but rather is based on it. It invariably arises from

the difference between the individual production price of a particular

capital having command over the monopolized natural force, on the

one hand, and the general production price of the total capital invested

in the sphere of production concerned, on the other.

    Secondly,  this  ground  rent  does  not  arise  from  the  absolute

increase  in  the  productiveness  of  employed  capital,  or  labor

appropriated  by  it,  since  this  can  only  reduce  the  value  of

commodities;  it  is  due  to  the  greater  relative  fruitfulness  of  specific

separate  capitals  invested  in  a  certain  production  sphere,  as

compared with investments of capital which are excluded from these

exceptional  and  natural  conditions  favoring  productiveness.  For

instance, if the use of steam should offer overwhelming advantages

not offered by the use of water-power, despite the fact that coal has

value  and  the  water-power  has  not,  and  if  these  advantages  more

than compensated for the expense, then, the water-power would not

be used and could not produce any surplus profit, and therefore could

not produce any rent.

    Thirdly, the natural force is not the source of surplus profit, but

only  its  natural  basis,  because  this  natural  basis  permits  an

exceptional increase in the productiveness of labor. In the same way,use  value  is  in  general  the  bearer  of  exchange  value,  but  not  its

cause. If the same use value could be obtained without labor, it would

have  no  exchange  value,  yet  it  would  retain,  as  before,  the  same

natural usefulness as use value. On the other hand, nothing can have

exchange  value  unless  it  has  use  value,  i.e.,  unless  it  is  a  natural

bearer of labor. Were it not for the fact that the various values are

averaged  out  into  prices  of  production,  and  the  various  individual

prices of production into a general price of production regulating the

market, the mere increase in productivity of labor through utilization of

the waterfall would merely lower the price of commodities produced

with  the  aid  of  this  waterfall,  without  increasing  the  share  of  profit

contained  in  these  commodities.  Similarly,  on  the  other  hand,  this

increased  productivity  of  labor  itself  would  not  be  converted  into

surplus  value  were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  capital  appropriates  the

natural and social productivity of the labor used by it as its own.

    Fourthly, the private ownership of the waterfall in itself has nothing

to  do  with  the  creation  of  the  surplus  value  (profit)  portion,  and

therefore, of the price of the commodity in general, which is produced

by means of the waterfall. This surplus profit would also exist if landed

property did not exist; for instance, if the land on which the waterfall is

situated  were  used  by  the  manufacturer  as  unclaimed  land.  Hence

landed  property  does  not  create  the  portion  of  value  which  is

transformed into surplus profit, but merely enables the landowner, the

owner of the waterfall, to coax this surplus profit out of the pocket of

the manufacturer and into his own. It is not the cause of the creation of

such surplus profit, but is the cause of its transformation into the form

of ground rent, and therefore of the appropriation of this portion of the

profit, or commodity price, by the owner of the land or waterfall.

    Fifthly, it is evident that the price of the waterfall, that is, the price

which the landowner would receive were he to sell it to a third party or

even to the manufacturer himself, does not immediately enter into the

production price of the commodities, although it does enter into the

individual cost price of the manufacturer; because the rent arises here

from the price of production of similar commodities produced by steam

machinery, and this price is regulated independently of the waterfall.

Furthermore, this price of the waterfall on the whole is an irrational

expression, but behind it is hidden a real economic relationship. Thewaterfall, like land in general, and like any natural force, has no value

because it does not represent any materialized labor, and therefore, it

has no price, which is normally no more than the expression of value

in money terms. Where there is no value, there is also eo ipso nothing

to  be  expressed  in  money.  This  price  is  nothing  more  than  the

capitalized rent. Landownership enables the landowner to appropriate

the difference between the individual profit and average profit.

    The profit thus acquired, which is renewed every year, may be

capitalized, and appears then as the price of the natural force itself. If

the  surplus  profit  realized  by  the  manufacturer  using  the  waterfall

amounts to £10 per year, and the average interest is 5%, then these

£10  represent  the  annual  interest  on  a  capital  of  £200  and  the

capitalization of the annual £10 which the waterfall enables its owner

to  appropriate  from  the  manufacturer,  appears  then  as  the  capital

value of the waterfall itself. That it is not the waterfall itself which has

value, but that its price is a mere reflection of the appropriated surplus

profit capitalistically calculated, becomes at once evident from the fact

that  the  price  of  £200  represents  merely  the  product  obtained  by

multiplying  a  surplus  profit  of  £10  by  20  years,  whereas,  other

conditions remaining equal, the same waterfall will enable its owner to

appropriate these £10 every year for an indefinite number of years —

30 years, 100 years, or x years; and, whereas, on the other hand,

should  some  new  method  of  production  not  applicable  with  water-

power  reduce  the  cost  price  of  commodities  produced  by  steam

machinery from £100 to £90, the surplus profit, and thereby the rent,

and thus the price of the waterfall, would disappear.

    Now that we have described the general concept of differential

rent, we shall pass on to its consideration in agriculture proper. What

applies to agriculture will also apply on the whole to mining.    Chapter 34: First Form of Differential Rent (Differential Rent I)



    Ricardo is quite right in the following observations:

    "Rent is always the difference between the produce obtained by

the  employment  of  two  equal  quantities  of  capital  and  labor"

(Principles, p. 59).

    [He means differential rent, for he assumes that no other rent but

differential  rent  exists.]  He  should  have  added,  "on  equal  areas  of

land" in so far as it is a matter of ground rent and not surplus profit in

general.

    In other words, surplus profit, if normal and not due to accidental

occurrences  in  the  circulation  process,  is  always  produced  as  a

difference between the products of two equal quantities of capital and

labor, and this surplus profit is transformed into ground rent when two

equal quantities of capital and labor are employed on equal areas of

land  with  unequal  results.  Moreover,  it  is  by  no  means  absolutely

necessary for this surplus profit to arise from the unequal results of

equal quantities of invested capital. The various investments may also

employ  unequal  quantities  of  capital.  Indeed,  this  is  generally  the

case.  But  equal  proportions,  for  instance  £100  of  each,  produce

unequal results; that is, their rates of profit are different. This is the

general prerequisite for the existence of surplus profit in any sphere of

capital investment. The second prerequisite is the transformation of

this surplus profit into the form of ground rent (of rent in general as a

form distinct from profit); it must be investigated in each case when,

how, under what conditions this transformation takes place [...]

    We shall first consider the unequal results of equal quantities of

capital applied to different plots of land of equal size; or, in the case of

unequal size, results calculated on the basis of equal areas.

    The  two  general  causes  of  these  unequal  results  —  quite

independent of capital — are: 1) Fertility. (With reference to this first

point, it will be necessary to discuss what is meant by natural fertility

of land and what factors are involved.) 2) The location of the land. Thisis a decisive factor in the case of colonies and in general determines

the sequence in which plots of land can be cultivated. Furthermore, it

is evident that these two different causes of differential rent — fertility

and location — may work in opposite directions. A certain plot of land

may be very favorably located and yet be very poor in fertility, and vice

versa. This circumstance is important, for it explains how it is possible

that bringing into cultivation the land of a certain country may equally

well proceed from the better to the worse land as vice versa. Finally, it

is clear that the progress of social production in general has, on the

one hand, the effect of evening out differences arising from location as

a  cause  of  ground  rent,  by  creating  local  markets  and  improving

locations by establishing communication and transportation facilities;

on the other hand, it increases the differences in individual locations of

plots of land by separating agriculture from manufacturing and forming

large centers of production, on the one hand, while relatively isolating

agricultural districts, on the other [...]

    Let us assume the existence of four kinds of soil: A, B, C, D. Let

us furthermore assume the price of one quarter of wheat = £3, or 60

shillings.  Since  the  rent  is  solely  differential  rent,  this  price  of  60

shillings  per  quarter  for  the  worst  soil  is  equal  to  the  price  of

production, that is, equal to the capital plus average profit. Let A be

this worst soil, which yields 1 quarter = 60 shilling for each 50 shillings

spent; hence the profit amounts to 10 shillings, or 20%.

    Let B yield 2 quarters = 120 shillings for the same expenditure.

This  would  mean  70  shillings  of  profit,  or  a  surplus  profit  of  60

shillings.

    Let C yield 3 quarters = 180 shillings for the same expenditure;

total profit = 130 shillings; surplus profit = 120 shillings.

    Let D yield 4 quarters = 240 shillings = 180 shillings of surplus

profit.

    We would then have the following sequence:

  

    The respective rents are: D = 190sh. — 10sh., or the difference

between D and A; C = 130sh. — 10sh., or the difference between C

and A; B = 70sh. — 10sh., or the difference between B and A; and the

total rent for B, C, D = 6 quarters = 360 shillings, equal to the sum of

the differences between D and A, C and A, B and A.

    This  sequence,  which  represents  a  given  product  in  a  given

condition  may,  considered  abstractly  (we  have  already  offered  the

reasons why this may be the case in reality), descend from D to A,

from  fertile  to  less  and  less  fertile  soil,  or  rise  from  A  to  D,  from

relatively poor to more and more fertile soil, or, finally, may fluctuate,

i.e., now rising, now descending — for instance from D to C, from C to

A, and from A to B.

    The  process  in  the  case  of  a  descending  sequence  was  as

follows: The price of a quarter of wheat rose gradually from, say, 15

shillings to 60 shillings. As soon as the 4 quarters produced by D (we

may consider these 4 quarters as so many million quarters) no longer

sufficed, the price of wheat rose to a point where the supply shortage

could be produced by C. That is to say, the price of wheat must have

risen to 20 shillings per quarter. When it had risen to 30 shillings per

quarter, B could be taken under cultivation, and when it reached 60

shillings A could be taken under cultivation; and the capital invested

did not have to content itself with a rate of profit lower than 20%. In

this  manner,  a  rent  was  established  for  D,  first  of  5  shillings  per

quarter = 20 shillings for the 4 quarters produced by it; then of 15

shillings per quarter = 60 shillings, then of 45 shillings per quarter =

180 shillings for 4 quarters.

    If the rate of profit of D originally was similarly = 20 %, then its

total profit on 4 quarters of wheat was also but 10 shillings, but this

represented more grain when the price was 15 shillings than it does

when  the  price  is  60  shillings.  But  since  the  grain  enters  into  thereproduction of labor power, and part of each quarter has to make

good some portion of wages and another constant capital, the surplus

value under these conditions was higher, and thus other things being

equal the rate of profit too. (The matter of rate of profit will have to be

specially analyzed, and in greater detail.)

    On the other hand, if the sequence were in the reverse order, that

is, if the process initiated from A, then the price of wheat at first would

rise above 60 shillings per quarter when new land would have to be

taken  under  cultivation.  But  since  the  necessary  supply  would  be

produced  by  B,  a  supply  of  2  quarters,  the  price  would  fall  to  60

shillings  again,  for  B  produced  wheat  at  a  cost  of  30  shillings  per

quarter, but sold it at 60 shillings because the supply just sufficed to

cover the demand. Thus a rent was formed, first of 60 shillings for B,

and in the same way for C and D; it is assumed throughout that the

market  price  remained  at  60  shillings,  although  C  and  D  produced

wheat  having  an  actual  value  of  20  and  15  shillings  per  quarter

respectively, because the supply of the one quarter produced by A

was needed as much as ever to satisfy the total demand. In this case,

the increase in demand above supply, which was first satisfied by A,

then by A and B, would not have made it possible to cultivate B, C and

D successively, but would merely have caused a general extension of

the sphere of cultivation, and the more fertile lands might only later

come under cultivation.

    In the first sequence, an increase in price would raise the rent and

decrease  the  rate  of  profit.  Such  a  decrease  might  be  entirely  or

partially checked by counteracting circumstances. This point will have

to be treated later in more detail. It should not be forgotten that the

general  rate  of  profit  is  not  determined  uniformly  in  all  spheres  of

production by the surplus value. It is not the agricultural profit which

determines industrial profit, but vice versa. But of this more anon.

    In  the  second  sequence  the  rate  of  profit  on  invested  capital

would remain the same. The amount of profit would be represented by

less grain; but the relative price of grain, compared with that of other

commodities,  would  have  risen.  However,  the  increase  in  profit

wherever such an increase takes place, becomes separated from the

profit in the form of rent, instead of flowing into the pockets of the

capitalist tenant farmer and appearing as a growing profit. The price ofgrain,  however,  could  remain  unchanged  under  the  conditions

assumed here.

    The development and growth of differential rent would remain the

same for fixed as well as for increasing prices, and for a continuous

progression  from  worse  to  better  soils  as  well  as  for  a  continuous

retrogression from better to worse soils.

    Thus  far  we  have  assumed:  1)  that  the  price  rises  in  one

sequence  and  remains  stationary  in  the  other;  2)  that  there  is  a

continuous  progression  from  better  to  worse  soil,  or  from  worse  to

better soil [...]

    As soon as all the land in a given country has been appropriated,

and  investments  of  capital  in  land,  cultivation,  and  population  have

reached  a  definite  level  —  all  given  conditions  as  soon  as  the

capitalist  mode  of  production  becomes  the  prevailing  one  and  also

encompasses agriculture — the price of uncultivated land of varying

quality (merely assuming differential rent to exist) is determined by the

price of the cultivated plots of land of the same quality and equivalent

location. The price is the same — after deducting the cost of bringing

the new land into cultivation — even though this land does not yield

any rent. The price of the land is, indeed, nothing but the capitalized

rent. But even in the case of cultivated land, the price pays only for

future rents, as, for instance, when the prevalent interest rate is 5%

and the rent for twenty years is paid at one time in advance. When

land  is  sold,  it  is  sold  as  land  yielding  rent,  and  the  prospective

character of the rent (which is here considered as a product of the soil,

but it only seems to be that) does not distinguish the uncultivated from

the cultivated land.

    The price of the uncultivated land, like its rent the price of which

represents the contracted form of the latter is quite illusory as long as

the land is not actually used. But it is thus determined a priori and is

realized  as  soon  as  a  purchaser  is  found.  Hence,  while  the  actual

average rent in a given country is determined by its actual average

annual rental and the relation of the latter to the total cultivated area,

the price of the uncultivated land is determined by the price of the

cultivated land, and is therefore but a reflection of the capital invested

in the cultivated land and the results obtained therefrom. Since all land

with the exception of the worst yields rent (and this rent, as we shallsee under the head of differential rent II, increases with the quantity of

capital and corresponding intensity of cultivation), the nominal price of

uncultivated  plots  of  land  is  thus  formed,  and  they  thus  become

commodities, a source of wealth for their owners. This explains at the

same time, why the price of land increases in a whole region, even in

the uncultivated part (Opdyke). Land speculation, for instance, in the

United States, is based solely on this reflection thrown by capital and

labor on uncultivated land.

    [Progress]  in  extending  cultivated  land  generally  takes  place

either  toward  inferior  soil  or  on  the  various  given  types  of  soil  in

varying proportions, depending on the manner in which they are met.

Extension on inferior soil is naturally never made voluntarily, but can

only  result  from  rising  prices,  assuming  a  capitalist  mode  of

production, and can only result from necessity under any other mode

of production. However, this is not absolutely so. Poor soil may be

preferred to a relatively better soil on account of location, which is of

decisive  importance  for  every  extension  of  cultivation  in  young

countries;  furthermore,  even  though  the  soil  formation  in  a  certain

region  may  generally  be  classified  as  fertile,  it  may  nevertheless

consist of a motley confusion of better and worse soils, so that the

inferior soil may have to be cultivated if only because it is found in the

immediate vicinity of the superior soil. If inferior soil is surrounded by

superior  soil,  then  the  latter  gives  it  the  advantage  of  location  in

comparison  with  more  fertile  soil  which  is  not  yet,  or  is  about  to

become, part of the cultivated area. Thus, the State of Michigan was

one of the first Western States to become an exporter of grain. Yet its

soil on the whole is poor. But its proximity to the State of New York

and its water-ways via the Lakes and Erie Canal initially gave it the

advantage over the States endowed by Nature with more fertile soil,

but situated farther to the West [...]        Chapter 35: Second Form of Differential Rent (Differential

                                        Rent II)



    Thus far we have considered differential rent only as the result of

varying  productivity  of  equal  amounts  of  capital  invested  in  equal

areas  of  land  of  different  fertility,  so  that  differential  rent  was

determined  by  the  difference  between  the  yield  from  the  capital

invested in the worst, rentless soil and that from the capital invested in

superior soil. We had side by side capitals invested in different plots of

land,  so  that  every  new  investment  of  capital  signified  a  more

extensive cultivation of the soil, an expansion of cultivated area. In the

last analysis, however, differential rent was by its nature merely the

result of the different productivity of equal capitals invested in land.

But can it make any difference if capitals of different productivity are

invested  successively  in  the  same  plot  of  land  or  side  by  side  in

different plots of land, provided the results are the same?

    To begin with, there is no denying that, in so far as the formation

of surplus profit is concerned, it is immaterial whether £3 in production

price per acre of A yield 1 qr, so that £3 is the price of production and

the regulating market price of 1 qr, while £3 in production price per

acre of B yield 2 qrs, and thereby £3 of surplus profit, similarly, £3 in

production price per acre of C yield 3 qrs and £6 of surplus profit, and,

finally,  £3  in  production  price  per  acre  of  D  yield  4  qrs  and  £9  of

surplus  profit;  or  whether  the  same  result  is  achieved  by  applying

these £12 in production price, or £10 of capital, with the same success

in the same sequence upon one and the same acre. It is in both cases

a capital of £10, whose value portions of £2 each are successively
                                                          1/2

invested — whether in four acres of varying fertility side by side, or

successively in one and the same acre of land — and because of their

varying outputs, one portion yields no surplus profit, whereas the other

portions yield surplus profit proportionate to their difference in yield

with respect to rentless investment.    The surplus profit and the various rates of surplus profit for the

different value portions of capital are formed in the same manner in

both cases. And the rent is nothing but a form of this surplus profit,

which constitutes its substance. But at any rate, in the second method,

there  are  some  difficulties  concerning  the  transformation  of  surplus

profit  into  rent,  this  change  of  form,  which  includes  the  transfer  of

surplus  profit  from  the  capitalist  tenant  to  the  landowner.  This

accounts  for  the  obstinate  resistance  of  English  tenants  to  official

agricultural  statistics.  And  it  accounts  for  their  struggle  against  the

landlords over the determination of actual results derived from their

capital investment (Morton). For rent is fixed when land is leased, and

after  that  the  surplus  profit  arising  from  successive  investments  of

capital flows into the pockets of the tenant as long as the lease lasts.

This is why the tenants have fought for long leases, and, on the other

hand, due to the greater power of the landlords, an increase in the

number of tenancies at will has taken place, i.e., leases which can be

cancelled annually.

    It is therefore evident from the very outset that, even if immaterial

for  the  law  of  formation  of  surplus  profit,  it  makes  a  considerable

difference  for  the  transformation  of  surplus  profit  into  ground  rent

whether equal capitals are invested side by side in equal areas of land

with unequal results, or whether they are invested successively in the

same land. The latter method confines this transformation, on the one

hand, within narrower limits, on the other hand, within more variable

limits. For this reason, the work of the tax-assessor, as Morton shows

in his Resources of Estates, becomes a very important, complicated

and  difficult  profession  in  countries  practicing  intensive  cultivation

(and,  economically  speaking,  we  mean  nothing  more  by  intensive

cultivation than the concentration of capital upon the same plot rather

than  its  distribution  among  several  adjoining  pieces  of  land).  If  soil

improvements  are  of  a  more  permanent  nature  the  artificially

increased  differential  fertility  of  the  soil  coincides  with  its  natural

differential  fertility  as  soon  as  the  lease  expires,  and  therefore  the

assessment of the rent corresponds to the determination of the rent on

plots of different fertilities in general. On the other hand, in so far as

the  formation  of  surplus  profit  is  determined  by  the  magnitude  of

operating capital, the amount of rent for a certain amount of operatingcapital is added to the average rent of the country and thus provision

is made for the new tenant to command sufficient capital to continue

cultivation in the same intensive manner.

    In the study of differential rent II, the following points are still to be

emphasized.

    First, its basis and point of departure, not just historically, but also

in so far as concerns its movements at any given period of time, is

differential rent I, that is, the simultaneous cultivation side by side of

soils of unequal fertility and location; in other words, the simultaneous

application, side by side, of unequal portions of the total agricultural

capital upon plots of land of unequal quality.

    Historically this is self-evident. In the colonies, colonists have but

little capital to invest; the principal production agents are labor and

land. Every individual head of family seeks for himself and his kin an

independent field of employment alongside his fellow-colonists. This

must  generally  be  the  case  in  agriculture  proper  even  under  pre-

capitalist  modes  of  production.  In  the  case  of  sheep-herding  and

cattle-raising,  in  general,  as  independent  lines  of  production,

exploitation of the soil is more or less common and extensive from the

very  outset.  The  capitalist  mode  of  production  has  for  its  point  of

departure  former  modes  of  production  in  which  the  means  of

production were, in fact or legally, the property of the tiller himself, in a

word, from a handicraft-like pursuit of agriculture. It is in the nature of

things that the latter gives way but gradually to the concentration of

means of production and their transformation into capital, as against

direct  producers  transformed  into  wage  laborers.  In  so  far  as  the

capitalist mode of production is manifested here typically, it occurs at

first particularly in sheep-herding and cattle-raising. But it is thus not

manifested in a concentration of capital upon a relatively small area of

land, but in production on a larger scale, economizing in the expense

of keeping horses, and in other production costs; but, in fact, not by

investing more capital in the same land.

    Furthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  natural  laws  of  field

husbandry, capital — used here, at the same time, in the sense of

means  of  production  already  produced  —  becomes  the  decisive

element in soil cultivation when cultivation has reached a certain level

of development and the soil has been correspondingly exhausted. Solong as the tilled area is small in comparison with the untilled, and so

long as the soil strength has not been exhausted (and this is the case

when cattle-raising and meat consumption prevail in the period before

agriculture proper and plant nutrition have become dominant), the new

developing  mode  of  production  is  opposed  to  peasant  production

mainly in the extensiveness of the land being tilled for a capitalist, in

other  words,  again  in  the  extensive  application  of  capital  to  larger

areas of land. It should therefore be remembered from the outset that

differential  rent  I  is  the  historical  basis  which  serves  as  a  point  of

departure. On the other hand, the movement of differential rent II at

any given moment occurs only within a sphere which is itself but the

variegated basis of differential rent I.

    Secondly,  in  the  differential  rent  in  form  II,  the  differences  in

distribution of capital (and ability to obtain credit) among tenants are

added to the differences in fertility. In manufacturing proper, each line

of business rapidly develops its own minimum volume of business and

a  corresponding  minimum  of  capital,  below  which  no  individual

business can be conducted successfully. In the same way, each line

of business develops a normal average amount of capital above this

minimum, which the bulk of producers should, and do, command. A

larger volume of capital can produce extra profit; a smaller volume

does not so much as yield the average profit. The capitalist mode of

production spreads in agriculture but slowly and unevenly, as may be

observed  in  England,  the  classic  land  of  the  capitalist  mode  of

production in agriculture. In so far as the free importation of grain does

not  exist,  or  its  effect  is  but  limited  because  the  volume  is  small,

producers working inferior soil, and thus under worse than average

conditions of production, determine the market price. A large portion of

the  total  mass  of  capital  invested  in  husbandry,  and  in  general

available to it, is in their hands.

    It is true that the peasant, for example, expends much labor on his

small plot of land. But it is labor isolated from objective social and

material conditions of productivity, labor robbed and stripped of these

conditions.

    This  circumstance  enables  the  actual  capitalist  tenants  to

appropriate a portion of surplus profit — a fact which would not obtain,at  least  so  far  as  this  point  is  concerned,  if  the  capitalist  mode  of

production were as evenly developed in agriculture as in manufacture.

    Let  us  first  consider  just  the  formation  of  surplus  profit  with

differential  rent  II,  without  for  the  present  bothering  about  the

conditions  under  which  the  transformation  of  this  surplus  profit  into

ground rent may take place.

    It  is  then  evident  that  differential  rent  II  is  merely  differently

expressed  differential  rent  I,  but  identical  to  it  in  substance.  The

variation in fertility of various soil types exerts its influence in the case

of differential rent I only in so far as unequal results are attained by

capitals  invested  in  the  soil,  i.e.,  the  amount  of  products  obtained

either  with  respect  to  equal  magnitudes  of  capital,  or  proportionate

amounts.  Whether  this  inequality  takes  place  for  various  capitals

invested  successively  in  the  same  land  or  for  capitals  invested  in

several plots of differing soil type — this can change nothing in the

difference  in  fertility  nor  in  its  product  and  can  therefore  change

nothing in the formation of differential rent for the more productively

invested portions of capital. It is still the soil which, now as before,

shows different fertility with the same investment of capital, save that

here  the  same  soil  performs  for  a  capital  successively  invested  in

different  portions  what  various  kinds  of  soil  do  in  the  case  of

differential rent I for different equal portions of social capital invested

in them [...]                        Chapter 36: Absolute Ground Rent



    In  the  analysis  of  differential  rent  we  proceeded  from  the

assumption that the worst soil does not pay any ground rent; or, to put

it more generally, only such land pays ground rent whose product has

an  individual  price  of  production  below  the  price  of  production

regulating the market, so that in this manner a surplus profit arises

which is transformed into rent. It is to be noted, to begin with, that the

law  of  differential  rent  as  such  is  entirely  independent  of  the

correctness or incorrectness of this assumption.

    Let us call the general price of production, by which the market is

regulated, P. Then, P coincides with the individual price of production

of the output of the worst soil A; i.e., its price pays for the constant and

variable capital consumed in production plus the average profit ( =

profit of enterprise plus interest).

    The  rent  in  this  case  is  equal  to  zero.  The  individual  price  of

production of the next better soil B is = P', and P > P'; that is, P pays

for more than the actual price of production of the product of soil B.

Let us now assume that P - P' = d; d, the excess of P over P', is

therefore the surplus profit which the farmer of soil type B realizes.

This d is transformed into rent, which must be paid to the landlord. Let

P'' be the actual price of production of the third type of soil C, and P -

P'' = 2d; then this 2d is converted into rent; similarly, let P''' be the

individual price of production of the fourth type of soil D, and P - P''' =

3d, which is transformed into ground rent, etc. Now let us assume the

premise for soil A, that rent = 0 and therefore the price of its product =

P + 0, is erroneous. Assume rather that it, too, yields rent = r. In that

case, two different conclusions follow.

    First: The price of the product of soil A would not be regulated by

the  price  of  production  on  the  latter,  but  would  include  an  excess

above  this  price,  i.e.,  would  be  =  P  +  r.  Because  assuming  the

capitalist  mode  of  production  to  be  functioning  normally,  that  is,

assuming  that  the  excess  r  which  the  farmer  pays  to  the  landlordrepresents neither a deduction from wages nor from the average profit

of capital, the farmer can only pay it by selling the product above its

price of production, thus, yielding him surplus profit if he did not have

to  turn  over  this  excess  to  the  landlord  in  the  form  of  rent.  The

regulating market price of the total output on the market derived from

all  soils  would  then  not  be  the  price  of  production  which  capital

generally yields in all spheres of production, i.e., a price equal to costs

plus average profit, but rather the price of production plus the rent, P +

r, and not P. For the price of the product of soil A represents generally

the limit of the regulating general market price, i.e., the price at which

the total product can be supplied, and to that extent it regulates the

price of this total product.

    But secondly: Although the general price of agricultural products

would in this case be significantly modified, the law of differential rent

would nevertheless in no way lose its force. For if the price of the

product of soil A, and thereby the general market price = P + r, the

price for soils B, C, D, etc., would likewise = P + r. But since P - P' = d

for soil B, then (P + r) -(P' + r) would likewise = d, and P - P'' = (P + r) -

(P'' + r) = 2d for soil C; and finally P - P''' = (P + r) - (P''' + r) = 3d for

soil D, etc. Thus the differential rent would be the same as before and

would be regulated by the same law, although the rent would include

an  element  independent  of  this  law  and  would  show  a  general

increase together with the price of the agricultural product. It follows,

then, that no matter what the case may be as regards the rent of the

least fertile soils, the law of differential rent is not only independent of

it, but that the only manner of grasping differential rent in keeping with

its character is to let the rent on soil A = 0. Whether this actually = 0 or

> 0 is immaterial so far as the differential rent is concerned, and, in

fact, does not come into consideration.

    The law of differential rent, then, is independent of the results of

the following study.

    If  we  were  now  to  inquire  more  deeply  into  the  basis  of  the

assumption that the product of the worst soil A does not yield any rent,

the answer would of necessity be as follows: If the market price of the

agricultural product, say grain, attains that level where an additional

investment of capital in soil A results in the usual price of production,

i.e.,  the  usual  average  profit  on  the  capital  is  yielded,  then  thiscondition suffices for investing the additional capital in soil A. In other

words, this condition is sufficient for the capitalist to invest new capital

yielding the usual profit and to employ it in the normal manner.

    It should be noted here that in this case, too, the market price

must be higher than the price of production of A. For as soon as the

additional  supply  is  created,  it  is  evident  that  the  relation  between

supply  and  demand  becomes  altered.  Formerly  the  supply  was

insufficient. Now it is sufficient. Hence the price must fall. In order to

fall, it must have been higher than the price of production of A. But

due to the fact that soil A newly taken under cultivation is less fertile,

the price does not fall again as low as when the price of production of

soil B regulated the market. The price of production of A constitutes

the limit, not for the temporary but for the relatively permanent rise of

the  market  price.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  new  soil  taken  under

cultivation is more fertile than the hitherto regulating soil A, and yet

only suffices to meet the increased demand, then the market price

remains  unchanged.  The  investigation  of  the  question  whether  the

poorest type of soil yields rent, however, coincides in this case too

with our present inquiry, for here too the assumption that soil A does

not yield any rent would be explained by the fact that the market price

is sufficient for the capitalist farmer to exactly cover, with this price, the

invested capital plus the average profit; in brief, it would be explained

by the fact that the market price yields him the price of production of

his commodities.

    At any rate, the capitalist farmer can cultivate soil A under these

conditions, inasmuch as he, as capitalist, has such power of decision.

The prerequisite for the normal expansion of capital in soil A is now

present. But from the premise that the capitalist farmer can now invest

capital in soil A under average conditions for the expansion of capital,

even if he did not have to pay any rent, it nowise follows that this land,

belonging to category A, is now at the disposal of the farmer without

further ado. The fact that the tenant farmer could realize the usual

profit on his capital did he not have to pay any rent, is by no means a

basis  for  the  landlord  to  lend  his  land  gratis  to  the  farmer  and  to

become so philanthropic as to grant crédit gratuit for the sake of a

business friendship. Such an assumption would mean the abstraction

of landed property, the elimination of landownership, and it is preciselythe existence of the latter that constitutes a limitation to the investment

of capital and the free expansion of capital in the land.

    This  limitation  does  not  at  all  disappear  before  the  simple

reflection of the farmer that the level of grain prices would enable him

to  realize  the  usual  profit  from  the  investment  of  his  capital  in  the

exploitation of soil A did he not have to pay any rent; in other words, if

he could proceed in effect as though landed property did not exist. But

differential  rent  presupposes  the  existence  of  a  monopoly  in  land

ownership,  landed  property  as  a  limitation  to  capital,  for  without  it

surplus profit would not be transformed into ground rent nor fall to the

share of the landlord instead of the farmer. And landed property as a

limitation continues to exist even when rent in the form of differential

rent disappears, i.e., on soil A.

    If we consider the cases in a country with capitalist production,

where  the  investment  of  capital  in  the  land  can  take  place  without

payment of rent, we shall find that they are all based on a de facto

abolition  of  landed  property,  if  not  also  the  legal  abolition;  this,

however, can only take place under very specific circumstances which

are by their very nature accidental. [For example, when] the landlord is

himself a capitalist, or the capitalist is himself a landlord. In this case

he may himself manage his land as soon as market price has risen

sufficiently to enable him to get, from what is now soil A, the price of

production,  that  is,  replacement  of  capital  plus  average  profit.  But

why? Because for him landed property does not constitute an obstacle

to  the  investment  of  capital.  He  can  treat  his  land  simply  as  an

element of Nature and therefore be guided solely by considerations of

expansion  of  his  capital,  by  capitalist  considerations.  Such  cases

occur in practice, but only as exceptions. Just as capitalist cultivation

of  the  soil  presupposes  the  separation  of  functioning  capital  from

landed  property,  so  does  it  as  a  rule  exclude  self-management  of

landed property [...]

    Differential  rent  has  the  peculiarity  that  landed  property  here

merely intercepts the surplus profit which would otherwise flow into the

pocket of the farmer, and which the latter may actually pocket under

certain circumstances during the period of his lease. Landed property

is here merely the cause for transferring a portion of the commodity

price which arises without the property having anything to do with it(indeed, in consequence of the fact that the price of production which

regulates the market price is determined by competition) and which

resolves  itself  into  surplus  profit  —  the  cause  for  transferring  this

portion of the price from one person to another, from the capitalist to

the landlord. But landed property is not the cause which creates this

portion of the price, or the rise in price upon which this portion of the

price is premised. On the other hand, if the worst soil A cannot be

cultivated — although its cultivation would yield the price of production

— until it produces something in excess of the price of production,

rent, then landed property is the creative cause of this rise in price.

Landed property itself has created rent. This fact is not altered, if [...]

the rent now paid on soil A constitutes differential rent compared with

the last additional investment of capital in old leaseholds, which pay

only the price of production. For the circumstance that soil A cannot

be cultivated until the regulating market price has risen high enough to

permit rent to be yielded from soil A — only this circumstance is the

basis here for the fact that the market price rises to a point which

enables the last investments in the old leaseholds to yield, indeed,

only their price of production, but a price of production which, at the

same time, yields rent on soil A. The fact that the latter has to pay rent

at all is, in this case, the cause for the differential rent between soil A

and the last investments in the old leaseholds.

    When stating, in general, that soil A does not pay any rent —

assuming the price of grain is regulated by the price of production —

we mean rent in the categorical sense of the word. If the farmer pays

"lease money" which constitutes a deduction from the normal wages

of his laborers, or from his own normal average profit, he does not pay

rent, i.e., an independent component of the price of his commodities

distinct  from  wages  and  profit.  We  have  already  indicated  that  this

continually  takes  place  in  practice.  In  so  far  as  the  wages  of  the

agricultural  laborers  in  a  given  country  are,  in  general,  depressed

below the normal average level of wages, so that a deduction from

wages, a part of the wages, as a general rule enters into rent, this

does not constitute an exceptional case for the farmer cultivating the

worst soil. In the same price of production which makes cultivation of

the worst soil possible these low wages already form a constituent

element, and the sale of the product at the price of production doesnot therefore enable the farmer cultivating this soil to pay any rent.

The landlord can also lease his land to some laborer, who may be

satisfied to pay to the former in the form of rent, all or the largest part

of  that  which  he  realizes  in  the  selling  price  over  and  above  the

wages. In all these cases, however, no real rent is paid in spite of the

fact that lease money is paid. But wherever conditions correspond to

those under the capitalist mode of production, rent and lease money

must coincide. Yet it is precisely this normal condition which must be

analyzed here [...]

    The relation of the price of production of a commodity to its value

is determined solely by the ratio of the variable part of the capital with

which  the  commodity  is  produced  to  its  constant  part,  or  by  the

organic composition of the capital producing it. If the composition of

the capital in a given sphere of production is lower than that of the

average  social  capital,  i.e.,  if  its  variable  portion,  which  is  used  for

wages, is larger in its relation to the constant portion, used for the

material  conditions  of  labor,  than  is  the  case  in  the  average  social

capital,  then  the  value  of  its  product  must  lie  above  the  price  of

production. In other words, because such capital employs more living

labor,  it  produces  more  surplus  value,  and  therefore  more  profit,

assuming  equal  exploitation  of  labor,  than  an  equally  large  aliquot

portion  of  the  social  average  capital.  The  value  of  its  product,

therefore,  is  above  the  price  of  production,  since  this  price  of

production is equal to capital replacement plus average profit, and the

average profit is lower than the profit produced in this commodity. The

surplus value produced by the average social capital is less than the

surplus value produced by a capital of this lower composition. The

opposite is the case when the capital invested in a certain sphere of

production is of a bigger composition than the social average capital.

The  value  of  commodities  produced  by  it  lies  below  their  price  of

production,  which  is  generally  the  case  with  products  of  the  most

developed industries.

    If  the  capital  in  a  certain  sphere  of  production  is  of  a  lower

composition than the average social capital, then this is, in the first

place, merely another way of saying that the productivity of the social

labor in this particular sphere of production is below the average; for

the  level  of  productivity  attained  is  manifested  in  the  relativepreponderance of constant over variable capital, or in the continual

decrease — for the given capital — of the portion used for wages. On

the other hand, if the capital in a certain sphere of production is of a

higher composition, then this reflects a development of productiveness

that is above the average.

    Leaving aside actual works of art, whose consideration by their

very  nature  is  excluded  from  our  discussion,  it  is  self-evident,

moreover,  that  different  spheres  of  production  require  different

proportions of constant and variable capital in accordance with their

specific technical features, and that living labor must play a bigger role

in  some,  and  smaller  in  others.  For  instance,  in  the  extractive

industries, which must be clearly distinguished from agriculture, raw

material as an element of constant capital is wholly absent, and even

auxiliary material rarely plays an important role. In the mining industry,

however, the other part of constant capital, i.e., fixed capital, plays an

important role. Nevertheless, here too, progress may be measured by

the relative increase of constant capital in relation to variable capital.

    If the composition of capital in agriculture proper is lower than that

of the average social capital, then, prima facie, this expresses the fact

that  in  countries  with  developed  production  agriculture  has  not

progressed to the same extent as the processing industries. Such a

fact  could  be  explained  —  aside  from  all  other  circumstances,

including in part decisive economic ones — by the earlier and more

rapid development of the mechanical sciences, and in particular their

application  compared  with  the  later  and  in  part  quite  recent

development  of  chemistry,  geology  and  physiology,  and  again,  in

particular,  their  application  to  agriculture.  Incidentally,  it  is  an

indubitable and long-known fact that the progress of agriculture itself

is  constantly  expressed  by  a  relative  growth  of  constant  capital  as

compared  with  variable  capital.  Whether  the  composition  of

agricultural capital is lower than that of the average social capital in a

specific  country  where  capitalist  production  prevails,  for  instance

England, is a question which can only be decided statistically, and for

our purposes it is superfluous to go into it in detail. In any case, it is

theoretically established that the value of agricultural products can be

higher than their price of production only on this assumption. In other

words, a capital of a certain size in agriculture produces more surplusvalue, or what amounts to the same, sets in motion and commands

more surplus labor (and with it employs more living labor generally)

than a capital of the same size of average social composition.

    This assumption, then, suffices for that form of rent which we are

analyzing here, and which can obtain only so long as this assumption

holds  good.  Wherever  this  assumption  no  longer  holds,  the

corresponding form of rent likewise no longer holds.

    However,  the  mere  existence  of  an  excess  in  the  value  of

agricultural products over their price of production would not in itself

suffice to explain the existence of a ground rent which is independent

of  differences  in  fertility  of  various  soil  types  and  in  successive

investments of capital on the same land — a rent, in short, which is to

be clearly distinguished in concept from differential rent and which we

may  therefore  call  absolute  rent.  Quite  a  number  of  manufactured

products are characterized by the fact that their value is higher than

their price of production, without thereby yielding any excess above

the average profit, or a surplus profit, which could be converted into

rent. Conversely, the existence and concept of price of production and

general rate of profit, which it implies, rest upon the fact that individual

commodities  are  not  sold  at  their  value.  Prices  of  production  arise

from an equalization of the values of commodities. After replacing the

respective capital values used up in the various spheres of production,

this distributes the entire surplus value, not in proportion to the amount

produced in the individual spheres of production and thus incorporated

in their commodities, but in proportion to the magnitude of advanced

capitals.

    Only  in  this  manner  do  average  profit  and  price  of  production

arise, whose characteristic element the former is. It is the perpetual

tendency  of  capitals  to  bring  about  through  competition  this

equalization in the distribution of surplus value produced by the total

capital, and to overcome all obstacles to this equalization. Hence it is

their tendency to tolerate only such surplus profits as arise, under all

circumstances, not from the difference between the values and prices

of production of commodities but rather from the difference between

the  general  price  of  production  governing  the  market  and  the

individual prices of production differing from it; surplus profits which

obtain  within  a  certain  sphere  of  production,  therefore,  and  notbetween  two  different  spheres,  and  thus  do  not  affect  the  general

prices of production of the various spheres, i.e., the general rate of

profit, but rather presuppose the transformation of values into prices of

production and a general rate of profit.

    This supposition rests, however, as previously discussed, upon

the  constantly  changing  proportional  distribution  of  the  total  social

capital among the various spheres of production, upon the perpetual

inflow  and  outflow  of  capitals,  upon  their  transferability  from  one

sphere to another, in short, upon their free movement between the

various  spheres  of  production,  which  represent  so  many  available

fields of investment for the independent components of the total social

capital.  The  premise  in  this  case  is  that  no  barrier,  or  just  an

accidental  and  temporary  barrier,  interferes  with  the  competition  of

capitals  —  for  instance,  in  a  sphere  of  production,  in  which  the

commodity values are higher than the prices of production, or where

the surplus value produced exceeds the average profit — to reduce

the  value  to  the  price  of  production  and  thereby  proportionally

distribute the excess surplus value of this sphere of production among

all spheres exploited by capital. But if the reverse occurs, if capital

meets an alien force which it can but partially, or not at all, overcome,

and  which  limits  its  investment  in  certain  spheres,  admitting  it  only

under  conditions  which  wholly  or  partly  exclude  that  general

equalization of surplus value to an average profit, then it is evident

that  the  excess  of  the  value  of  commodities  in  such  spheres  of

production over their price of production would give rise to a surplus

profit, which could be converted into rent and such made independent

with respect to profit. Such an alien force and barrier are presented by

landed property, when confronting capital in its endeavor to invest in

land; such a force is the landlord vis-à-vis the capitalist.

    Landed property is here the barrier which does not permit any

new  investment  of  capital  in  hitherto  uncultivated  or  unrented  land

without levying a tax, or in other words, without demanding a rent,

although the land to be newly brought under cultivation may belong to

a category which does not yield any differential rent and which, were it

not for landed property, could have been cultivated even at a small

increase  in  market  price,  so  that  the  regulating  market  price  would

have  netted  to  the  cultivator  of  this  worst  soil  solely  his  price  ofproduction.  But  owing  to  the  barrier  raised  by  landed  property,  the

market price must rise to a level at which the land can yield a surplus

over the price of production, i.e., yield a rent. However, since the value

of the commodities produced by agricultural capital is higher than their

price of production, according to our assumption, this rent (save for

one case which we shall discuss forthwith) forms the excess of value

over the price of production, or a part of it. Whether the rent equals the

entire difference between the value and price of production, or only a

greater or lesser part of it, will depend wholly on the relation between

supply  and  demand  and  on  the  area  of  land  newly  taken  under

cultivation. So long as the rent does not equal the excess of the value

of agricultural products over their price of production, a portion of this

excess will always enter into the general equalization and proportional

distribution of all surplus value among the various individual capitals.

    As soon as the rent does equal the excess of the value over the

price of production, this entire portion of surplus value over and above

the  average  profit  will  be  withdrawn  from  this  equalization.  But

whether this absolute rent equals the whole excess of value over the

price of production, or just a part of it, the agricultural products will

always be sold at a monopoly price, not because their price exceeds

their value, but because it equals their value, or because their price is

lower than their value but higher than their price of production. Their

monopoly  would  consist  in  the  fact  that,  unlike  other  products  of

industry whose value is higher than the general price of production,

they are not levelled out to the price of production. Since one portion

of the value, as well as of price of production, is an actually given

constant, namely the cost price, representing the capital = k used up

in  production,  their  difference  consists  in  the  other,  the  variable

portion, the surplus value, which equals p, the profit, in the price of

production, i.e., equals the total surplus value calculated on the social

capital and on every individual capital as an aliquot part of the social

capital;  but  which  in  the  value  of  commodities  equals  the  actual

surplus value created by this particular capital, and forms an integral

part of the commodity values produced by this capital. If the value of

commodities is higher than their price of production, then the price of

production = k + p, and the value = k + p + d, so that p + d = the

surplus value contained therein.    The  difference  between  the  value  and  the  price  of  production,

therefore, = d, the excess of surplus value created by this capital over

the surplus value allocated to it through the general rate of profit. It

follows from this that the price of agricultural products may lie higher

than their price of production, without reaching their value. It follows,

furthermore,  that  a  permanent  increase  in  the  price  of  agricultural

products  may  take  place  up  to  a  certain  point,  before  their  price

reaches their value. It follows likewise that the excess in the value of

agricultural  products  over  their  price  of  production  can  become  a

determining  element  of  their  general  market  price  solely  as  a

consequence of the monopoly in landed property. It follows, finally,

that in this case the increase in the price of the product is not the

cause of rent, but rather that rent is the cause of the increase in the

price of the product. If the price of the product from a unit area of the

worst soil = P + r, then all differential rents will rise by corresponding

multiples  of  r,  since  the  assumption  is  that  P  +  r  becomes  the

regulating market price [...]

    Although  landed  property  may  drive  the  price  of  agricultural

produce above its price of production, it does not depend on this, but

rather on the general state of the market, to what degree market price

exceeds  the  price  of  production  and  approaches  the  value,  and  to

what extent therefore the surplus value created in agriculture over and

above the given average profit shall either be transformed into rent or

enter  into  the  general  equalization  of  the  surplus  value  to  average

profit. At any rate this absolute rent arising out of the excess of value

over the price of production is but a portion of the agricultural surplus

value, a conversion of this surplus value into rent, its being filched by

the landlord; just as the differential rent arises out of the conversion of

surplus  profit  into  rent,  its  being  filched  by  the  landlord  under  a

generally regulating price of production. These two forms of rent are

the only normal ones. Apart from them the rent can be based only

upon an actual monopoly price, which is determined neither by price

of production nor by value of commodities, but by the buyers’ needs

and ability to pay. Its analysis belongs under the theory of competition,

where the actual movement of market prices is considered.

    If  all  the  land  suitable  for  agriculture  in  a  certain  country  were

leased  —  assuming  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  and  normalconditions to be general — there would not be any land not paying

rent;  but  there  might  be  some  capitals,  certain  parts  of  capitals

invested in land, that might not yield any rent. For as soon as the land

has been rented, landed property ceases to act as an absolute barrier

against the investment of necessary capital. Still, it continues to act as

a  relative  barrier  even  after  that,  in  so  far  as  the  reversion  to  the

landlord  of  the  capital  incorporated  in  the  land  circumscribes  the

activity of the tenant within very definite limits. Only in this case all rent

would be transformed into differential rent, although this would not be

a  differential  rent  determined  by  any  difference  in  soil  fertility,  but

rather by the difference between the surplus profits arising from the

last investments of capital in a particular soil type and the rent paid for

the  lease  of  the  worst  quality  land.  Landed  property  acts  as  an

absolute barrier only to the extent that the landlord exacts a tribute for

making land at all accessible to the investment of capital. When such

access has been gained, he can no longer set any absolute limits to

the size of any investment of capital in a given plot of land. In general,

housing construction meets a barrier in the ownership by a third party

of the land upon which the houses are to be built. But, once this land

has been leased for the purpose of housing construction, it depends

upon the tenant whether he will build a large or a small house.

    If the average composition of agricultural capital were equal to, or

higher than, that of the average social capital, then absolute rent —

again in the sense just described — would disappear; i.e., rent which

differs  equally  from  differential  rent  as  well  as  that  based  upon  an

actual monopoly price. The value of agricultural produce, then, would

not lie above its price of production, and the agricultural capital would

not set any more labor in motion, and therefore would also not realize

any more surplus labor than the non-agricultural capital. The same

would  take  place,  were  the  composition  of  agricultural  capital  to

become equal to that of the average social capital with the progress of

civilization [...]            PART 7: REVENUES AND THEIR SOURCES

              CHAPTER 48: THE TRINITY FORMULA



                                              I



    Capital — profit (profit of enterprise plus interest), land — ground

rent, labor — wages, this is the trinity formula which comprises all the

secrets of the social production process.

    Furthermore, since as previously demonstrated interest appears

as the specific characteristic product of capital and profit of enterprise

on the contrary appears as wages independent of capital, the above

trinity formula reduces itself more specifically to the following:

    Capital — interest, land — ground rent, labor — wages, where

profit, the specific characteristic form of surplus value belonging to the

capitalist mode of production, is fortunately eliminated.

    On  closer  examination  of  this  economic  trinity,  we  find  the

following:

    First, the alleged sources of the annually available wealth belong

to  widely  dissimilar  spheres  and  are  not  at  all  analogous  with  one

another. They have about the same relation to each other as lawyer’s

fees, red beets and music.

    Capital, land, labor! However, capital is not a thing, but rather a

definite  social  production  relation,  belonging  to  a  definite  historical

formation of society, which is manifested in a thing and lends this thing

a specific social character. Capital is not the sum of the material and

produced  means  of  production.  Capital  is  rather  the  means  of

production transformed into capital, which in themselves are no more

capital  than  gold  or  silver  in  itself  is  money.  It  is  the  means  of

production  monopolized  by  a  certain  section  of  society,  confronting

living  labor  power  as  products  and  working  conditions  rendered

independent of this very labor power, which are personified through

this  antithesis  in  capital.  It  is  not  merely  the  products  of  laborersturned into independent powers, products as rulers and buyers of their

producers, but rather also the social forces and the [related] form of

this labor, which confront the laborers as properties of their products.

Here, then, we have a definite and, at first glance, very mystical, social

form, of one of the factors in a historically produced social production

process.

    And now alongside of this we have the land, inorganic nature as

such, rudis indigestaque moles, in all its primeval wildness. Value is

labor. Therefore, surplus value cannot be earth. Absolute fertility of the

soil effects nothing more than the following: a certain quantity of labor

produces a certain product — in accordance with the natural fertility of

the soil. The difference in soil fertility causes the same quantities of

labor and capital, hence the same value, to be manifested in different

quantities of agricultural products; that is, causes these products to

have different individual values. The equalization of these individual

values  into  market  values  is  responsible  for  the  fact  that  the

"advantages  of  fertile  over  inferior  soil  ...  are  transferred  from  the

cultivator or consumer to the landlord". (Ricardo, Principles, London,

1821, p.62.)

    And  finally,  as  third  party  in  this  union,  a  mere  ghost  —  "the"

Labor, which is no more than an abstraction and taken by itself does

not exist at all, or, if we take [that which is behind it], the productive

activity  of  human  beings  in  general,  by  which  they  promote  the

interchange with Nature, divested not only of every social form and

well-defined  character,  but  even  in  its  bare  natural  existence,

independent  of  society,  removed  from  all  societies,  and  as  an

expression and confirmation of life which the still non-social man in

general has in common with the one who is in any way social.                                              II



    [...]  But  how  should  land  create  value,  i.e.,  a  socially  defined

quantity of labor, and moreover that particular portion of the value of

its own products which forms the rent? Land, e.g., takes part as an

agent of production in creating a use value, a material product, wheat.

But it has nothing to do with the production of the value of wheat. In so

far as value is represented by wheat, the latter is merely considered

as a definite quantity of materialized social labor, regardless of the

particular  substance  in  which  this  labor  is  manifested  or  of  the

particular use value of this substance. This nowise contradicts that 1)

other circumstances being equal, the cheapness or dearness of wheat

depends  upon  the  productivity  of  the  soil.  The  productivity  of

agricultural labor is dependent on natural conditions, and the same

quantity  of  labor  is  represented  by  more  or  fewer  products,  use

values, in accordance with such productivity. How large the quantity of

labor represented in one bushel of wheat depends upon the number of

bushels yielded by the same quantity of labor. It depends, in this case,

upon the soil productivity in what quantities of product the value shall

be manifested. But this value is given, independent of this distribution.

Value is represented in use value; and use value is a prerequisite for

the creation of value; but it is folly to create an antithesis by placing a

use value, like land, on one side and on the other side value, and a

particular portion of value at that. [...]                                              III



    Vulgar economy actually does no more than interpret, systematize

and  defend  in  doctrinaire  fashion  the  conceptions  of  the  agents  of

bourgeois  production  who  are  entrapped  in  bourgeois  production

relations. It should not astonish us, then, that vulgar economy feels

particularly  at  home  in  the  estranged  outward  appearances  of

economic  relations  in  which  these  prima  facie  absurd  and  perfect

contradictions  appear  and  that  these  relations  seem  the  more  self-

evident  the  more  their  internal  relationships  are  concealed  from  it,

although they are understandable to the popular mind. But all science

would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of

things directly coincided. Thus, vulgar economy has not the slightest

suspicion  that  the  trinity  which  it  takes  as  its  point  of  departure,

namely, land — rent, capital — interest, labor — wages or the price of

labor, are prima facie three impossible combinations. First we have

the use value land, which has no value, and the exchange value rent:

so that a social relation conceived as a thing is made proportional to

Nature, i.e., two incommensurable magnitudes are supposed to stand

in a given ratio to one another. Then capital — interest.

    If  capital  is  conceived  as  a  certain  sum  of  values  represented

independently by money, then it is prima facie nonsense to say that a

certain value should be worth more than it is worth. It is precisely in

the form: capital — interest that all intermediate links are eliminated,

and capital is reduced to its most general formula, which therefore in

itself is also inexplicable and absurd. The vulgar economist prefers the

formula capital — interest, with its occult quality of making a value

unequal  to  itself,  to  the  formula  capital  —  profit,  precisely  for  the

reason  that  this  already  more  nearly  approaches  actual  capitalist

relations. Then again, driven by the disturbing thought that 4 is not 5

and that 100 taler cannot possibly be 110 taler, he flees from capital

as value to the material substance of capital; to its use value as a

condition  of  production  of  labor,  to  machinery,  raw  materials,  etc.Thus,  he  is  able  once  more  to  substitute  in  place  of  the  first

incomprehensible relation, whereby 4 = 5, a wholly incommensurable

one between a use value, a thing on one side, and a definite social

production  relation,  surplus  value,  on  the  other,  as  in  the  case  of

landed  property.  As  soon  as  the  vulgar  economist  arrives  at  this

incommensurable relation, everything becomes clear to him, and he

no  longer  feels  the  need  for  further  thought.  For  he  has  arrived

precisely  at  the  "rational"  in  bourgeois  conception.  Finally,  labor  —

wages, or price of labor, is an expression, as shown in Book I, which

prima facie contradicts the conception of value as well as of price —

the latter generally being but a definite expression of value. And "price

of labor" is just as irrational as a yellow logarithm. But here the vulgar

economist  is  all  the  more  satisfied,  because  he  has  gained  the

profound  insight  of  the  bourgeois,  namely,  that  he  pays  money  for

labor, and since precisely the contradiction between the formula and

the conception of value relieves him from all obligation to understand

the latter.

    We  have  seen  that  the  capitalist  process  of  production  is  a

historically  determined  form  of  the  social  process  of  production  in

general.  The  latter  is  as  much  a  production  process  of  material

conditions  of  human  life  as  a  process  taking  place  under  specific

historical  and  economic  production  relations,  producing  and

reproducing these production relations themselves, and thereby also

the bearers of this process, their material conditions of existence and

their mutual relations, i.e., their particular socio-economic form. For

the aggregate of these relations, in which the agents of this production

stand with respect to Nature and to one another, and in which they

produce,  is  precisely  society,  considered  from  the  standpoint  of  its

economic structure. Like all its predecessors, the capitalist process of

production  proceeds  under  definite  material  conditions,  which  are,

however,  simultaneously  the  bearers  of  definite  social  relations

entered into by individuals in the process of reproducing their life.

    Those  conditions,  like  these  relations,  are  on  the  one  hand

prerequisites, on the other hand results and creations of the capitalist

process of production; they are produced and reproduced by it. We

saw also that capital — and the capitalist is merely capital personified

and  functions  in  the  process  of  production  solely  as  the  agent  ofcapital — in its corresponding social process of production, pumps a

definite  quantity  of  surplus  labor  out  of  the  direct  producers,  or

laborers; capital obtains this surplus labor without an equivalent, and

in essence it always remains forced labor — no matter how much it

may  seem  to  result  from  free  contractual  agreement.  This  surplus

labor  appears  as  surplus  value,  and  this  surplus  value  exists  as  a

surplus product. Surplus labor in general, as labor performed over and

above the given requirements, must always remain. In the capitalist as

well as in the slave system, etc., it merely assumes an antagonistic

form  and  is  supplemented  by  complete  idleness  of  a  stratum  of

society. A definite quantity of surplus labor is required as insurance

against accidents, and by the necessary and progressive expansion of

the process of reproduction in keeping with the development of the

needs and the growth of population, which is called accumulation from

the  viewpoint  of  the  capitalist.  It  is  one  of  the  civilizing  aspects  of

capital  that  it  enforces  this  surplus  labor  in  a  manner  and  under

conditions which are more advantageous to the development of the

productive forces, social relations, and the creation of the elements for

a  new  and  higher  form  than  under  the  preceding  forms  of  slavery,

serfdom, etc.

    Thus it gives rise to a stage, on the one hand, in which coercion

and monopolization of social development (including its material and

intellectual advantages) by one portion of society at the expense of

the other are eliminated; on the other hand, it creates the material

means and embryonic conditions, making it possible in a higher form

of society to combine this surplus labor with a greater reduction of

time  devoted  to  material  labor  in  general.  For,  depending  on  the

development  of  labor  productivity,  surplus  labor  may  be  large  in  a

small total working day, and relatively small in a large total working

day. If the necessary labor time = 3 and the surplus labor = 3, then the

total working day = 6 and the rate of surplus labor = 100%. If the

necessary labor = 9 and the surplus labor = 3, then the total working

day = 12 and the rate of surplus labor only = 33%. In that case, it
                                                                1/3

depends  upon  the  labor  productivity  how  much  use  value  shall  be

produced in a definite time, hence also in a definite surplus labor time.

    The  actual  wealth  of  society,  and  the  possibility  of  constantly

expanding its reproduction process, therefore, do not depend upon theduration of surplus labor, but upon its productivity and the more or less

copious conditions of production under which it is performed. In fact,

the  realm  of  freedom  actually  begins  only  where  labor  which  is

determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus in

the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material

production. Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his

wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilized man, and he

must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of

production.  With  his  development  this  realm  of  physical  necessity

expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of

production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this

field  can  only  consist  in  socialized  man,  the  associated  producers,

rationally  regulating  their  interchange  with  Nature,  bringing  it  under

their  common  control,  instead  of  being  ruled  by  it  as  by  the  blind

forces  of  Nature;  and  achieving  this  with  the  least  expenditure  of

energy and under conditions most favorable to, and worthy of, their

human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity.

Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end

in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth

only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the

working day is its basic prerequisite.

    In a capitalist society, this surplus value, or this surplus product

(leaving aside chance fluctuations in its distribution and considering

only  its  regulating  law,  its  standardizing  limits),  is  divided  among

capitalists as dividends proportionate to the share of the social capital

each holds. In this form surplus value appears as average profit which

falls to the share of capital, an average profit which in turn divides into

profit of enterprise and interest, and which under these two categories

may fall into the laps of different kinds of capitalists. This appropriation

and distribution of surplus value, or surplus product, on the part of

capital,  however,  has  its  barrier  in  landed  property.  Just  as  the

operating capitalist pumps surplus labor, and thereby surplus value

and surplus product in the form of profit, out of the laborer, so the

landlord  in  turn  pumps  a  portion  of  this  surplus  value,  or  surplus

product, out of the capitalist in the form of rent in accordance with the

laws already elaborated.    Hence,  when  speaking  here  of  profit  as  that  portion  of  surplus

value falling to the share of capital, we mean average profit (equal to

profit  of  enterprise  plus  interest)  which  is  already  limited  by  the

deduction  of  rent  from  the  aggregate  profit  (identical  in  mass  with

aggregate surplus value); the deduction of rent is assumed. Profit of

capital (profit of enterprise plus interest) and ground rent are thus no

more  than  particular  components  of  surplus  value,  categories  by

which surplus value is differentiated depending on whether it falls to

the  share  of  capital  or  landed  property,  headings  which  in  no  whit

however alter its nature. Added together, these form the sum of social

surplus value. Capital pumps the surplus labor, which is represented

by  surplus  value  and  surplus  product,  directly  out  of  the  laborers.

Thus, in this sense, it may be regarded as the producer of surplus

value. Landed property has nothing to do with the actual process of

production. Its role is confined to transferring a portion of the produced

surplus  value  from  the  pockets  of  capital  to  its  own.  However,  the

landlord plays a role in the capitalist process of production not merely

through the pressure he exerts upon capital, nor merely because large

landed property is a prerequisite and condition of capitalist production

since  it  is  a  prerequisite  and  condition  of  the  expropriation  of  the

laborer  from  the  means  of  production,  but  particularly  because  he

appears as the personification of one of the most essential conditions

of production.

    Finally,  the  laborer  in  the  capacity  of  owner  and  seller  of  his

individual labor power receives a portion of the product under the label

of  wages,  in  which  that  portion  of  his  labor  appears  which  we  call

necessary  labor,  i.e.,  that  required  for  the  maintenance  and

reproduction of this labor power, be the conditions of this maintenance

and reproduction scanty or bountiful, favorable or unfavorable.

    Whatever  may  be  the  disparity  of  these  relations  in  other

respects, they all have this in common: Capital yields a profit year

after year to the capitalist, land a ground rent to the landlord, and labor

power, under normal conditions and so long as it remains useful labor

power,  a  wage  to  the  laborer.  These  three  portions  of  total  value

annually  produced,  and  the  corresponding  portions  of  the  annually

created total product (leaving aside for the present any consideration

of  accumulation),  may  be  annually  consumed  by  their  respectiveowners, without exhausting the source of their reproduction. They are

like the annually consumable fruits of a perennial tree, or rather three

trees;  they  form  the  annual  incomes  of  three  classes,  capitalist,

landowner  and  laborer,  revenues  distributed  by  the  functioning

capitalist  in  his  capacity  as  direct  extorter  of  surplus  labor  and

employer of labor in general. Thus, capital appears to the capitalist,

land  to  the  landlord,  and  labor  power,  or  rather  labor  itself,  to  the

laborer (since he actually sells labor power only as it is manifested,

and since the price of labor power, as previously shown, inevitably

appears as the price of labor under the capitalist mode of production),

as three different sources of their specific revenues, namely, profit,

ground rent and wages. They are really so in the sense that capital is

a perennial pumping-machine of surplus labor for the capitalist, land a

perennial magnet for the landlord, attracting a portion of the surplus

value  pumped  out  by  capital,  and  finally,  labor  the  constantly  self-

renewing condition and ever self-renewing means of acquiring under

the title of wages a portion of the value created by the laborer and

thus a part of the social product measured by this portion of value, i.e.,

the  necessities  of  life.  They  are  so,  furthermore,  in  the  sense  that

capital fixes a portion of the value and thereby of the product of the

annual labor in the form of profit; landed property fixes another portion

in the form of rent; and wage labor fixes a third portion in the form of

wages,  and  precisely  by  this  transformation  converts  them  into

revenues of the capitalist, landowner, and laborer, without, however,

creating the substance itself which is transformed into these various

categories. The distribution rather presupposes the existence of this

substance,  namely,  the  total  value  of  the  annual  product,  which  is

nothing  but  materialized  social  labor.  Nevertheless,  it  is  not  in  this

form that the matter appears to the agents of production, the bearers

of  the  various  functions  in  the  production  process,  but  rather  in  a

distorted form. Why this takes place will be developed in the further

course of our analysis. Capital landed property and labor appear to

those agents of production as three different, independent sources,

from  which  as  such  there  arise  three  different  components  of  the

annually produced value — and thereby the product in which it exists;

thus, from which there arise not merely the different forms of this value

as  revenues  falling  to  the  share  of  particular  factors  in  the  socialprocess  of  production,  but  from  which  this  value  itself  arises,  and

thereby the substance of these forms of revenue [...]

    It might seem as if a rational relation were expressed at least in

"labor  —  wages".  But  this  is  no  more  the  case  than  with  "land  —

ground rent". In so far as labor is value-creating, and is manifested in

the value of commodities, it has nothing to do with the distribution of

this value among various categories. In so far as it has the specifically

social character of wage labor, it is not value-creating. It has already

been shown in general that wages of labor, or price of labor, is but an

irrational expression for the value, or price of labor power; and the

specific social conditions, under which this labor power is sold, have

nothing to do with labor as a general agent in production. Labor is also

materialized in that value component of a commodity which as wages

forms the price of labor power; it creates this portion just as much as

the other portions of the product; but it is materialized in this portion no

more and no differently than in the portions forming rent or profit. And,

in  general,  when  we  establish  labor  as  value-creating,  we  do  not

consider it in its concrete form as a condition of production, but in its

social delimitation which differs from that of wage labor.

    Even the expression "capital — profit" is incorrect here. If capital

is  viewed  in  the  only  relation  in  which  it  produces  surplus  value,

namely, its relation to the laborer whereby it extorts surplus labor by

compulsion exerted upon labor power, i.e., the wage laborer, then this

surplus  value  comprises,  outside  of  profit  (profit  of  enterprise  plus

interest), also rent, in short the entire undivided surplus value. Here,

on the other hand, as a source of revenue, it is placed only in relation

to  that  portion  falling  to  the  share  of  the  capitalist.  This  is  not  the

surplus value which it extracts generally but only that portion which it

extracts  for  the  capitalist.  Still  more  does  all  connection  vanish  no

sooner the formula is transformed into "capital — interest" [...]

    In the case of the simplest categories of the capitalist mode of

production,  and  even  of  commodity  production,  in  the  case  of

commodities and money, we have already pointed out the mystifying

character that transforms the social relations, for which the material

elements of wealth serve as bearers in production, into properties of

these things themselves (commodities) and still more pronouncedly

transforms the production relation itself into a thing (money). All formsof society, in so far as they reach the stage of commodity production

and  money  circulation,  take  part  in  this  perversion.  But  under  the

capitalist mode of production and in the case of capital, which forms

its  dominant  category,  its  determining  production  relation,  this

enchanted and perverted world develops still more. If one considers

capital, to begin with, in the actual process of production as a means

of extracting surplus labor, then this relationship is still very simple,

and the actual connection impresses itself upon the bearers of this

process,  the  capitalists  themselves,  and  remains  in  their

consciousness.

    The  violent  struggle  over  the  limits  of  the  working  day

demonstrates  this  strikingly.  But  even  within  this  non-mediated

sphere, the sphere of direct action between labor and capital, matters

do not rest in this simplicity. With the development of relative surplus

value in the actual specifically capitalist mode of production, whereby

the productive powers of social labor are developed, these productive

powers and the social interrelations of labor in the direct labor process

seem transferred from labor to capital. Capital thus becomes a very

mystic being since all of labor’s social productive forces appear to be

due to capital, rather than labor as such, and seem to issue from the

womb of capital itself. Then the process of circulation intervenes, with

its changes of substance and form, on which all parts of capital, even

agricultural capital, devolve to the same degree that the specifically

capitalist mode of production develops.

    This  is  a  sphere  where  the  relations  under  which  value  is

originally produced are pushed completely into the background. In the

direct process of production, the capitalist already acts simultaneously

as producer of commodities and manager of commodity production.

Hence this process of production appears to him by no means simply

as a process of producing surplus value. But whatever may be the

surplus value extorted by capital in the actual production process and

appearing in commodities, the value and surplus value contained in

the commodities must first be realized in the circulation process. And

both  the  restitution  of  the  values  advanced  in  production  and,

particularly, the surplus value contained in the commodities seem not

merely to be realized in the circulation, but actually to arise from it; an

appearance which is especially reinforced by two circumstances: first,the  profit  made  in  selling  depends  on  cheating,  deceit,  inside

knowledge, skill and a thousand favorable market opportunities; and

then by the circumstance that added here to labor time is a second

determining element — time of circulation.

    This acts, in fact, only as a negative barrier against the formation

of  value  and  surplus  value,  but  it  has  the  appearance  of  being  as

definite  a  basis  as  labor  itself  and  of  introducing  a  determining

element that is independent of labor and resulting from the nature of

capital. In Book II we naturally had to present this sphere of circulation

merely with reference to the form determinations which it created and

to  demonstrate  the  further  development  of  the  structure  of  capital

taking place in this sphere. But in reality this sphere is the sphere of

competition, which, considered in each individual case, is dominated

by  chance;  where,  then,  the  inner  law,  which  prevails  in  these

accidents and regulates them, is only visible when these accidents are

grouped  together  in  large  numbers,  where  it  remains,  therefore,

invisible and unintelligible to the individual agents in production. But

furthermore: the actual process of production, as a unity of the direct

production  process  and  the  circulation  process,  gives  rise  to  new

formations, in which the vein of internal connections is increasingly

lost,  the  production  relations  are  rendered  independent  of  one

another,  and  the  component  values  become  ossified  into  forms

independent of one another.

    The conversion of surplus value into profit, as we have seen, is

determined as much by the process of circulation as by the process of

production. Surplus value, in the form of profit, is no longer related

back to that portion of capital invested in labor from which it arises, but

to the total capital. The rate of profit is regulated by laws of its own,

which permit, or even require, it to change while the rate of surplus

value remains unaltered. All this obscures more and more the true

nature of surplus value and thus the actual mechanism of capital. Still

more is this achieved through the transformation of profit into average

profit  and  of  values  into  prices  of  production,  into  the  regulating

averages of market prices. A complicated social process intervenes

here, the equalization process of capitals, which divorces the relative

average prices of the commodities from their values, as well as the

average profits in the various spheres of production (quite aside fromthe  individual  investments  of  capital  in  each  particular  sphere  of

production)  from  the  actual  exploitation  of  labor  by  the  particular

capitals.

    Not only does it appear so, but it is true in fact that the average

price  of  commodities  differs  from  their  value,  thus  from  the  labor

realized in them, and the average profit of a particular capital differs

from  the  surplus  value  which  this  capital  has  extracted  from  the

laborers employed by it. The value of commodities appears, directly,

solely in the influence of fluctuating productivity of labor upon the rise

and fall of the prices of production, upon their movement and not upon

their ultimate limits. Profit seems to be determined only secondarily by

direct exploitation of labor, in so far as the latter permits the capitalist

to realize a profit deviating from the average profit at the regulating

market  prices,  which  apparently  prevail  independent  of  such

exploitation.  Normal  average  profits  themselves  seem  immanent  in

capital and independent of exploitation; abnormal exploitation, or even

average exploitation under favorable, exceptional conditions, seems to

determine only the deviations from average profit, not this profit itself.

The  division  of  profit  into  profit  of  enterprise  and  interest  (not  to

mention the intervention of commercial profit and profit from money-

dealing,  which  are  founded  upon  circulation  and  appear  to  arise

completely  from  it,  and  not  from  the  process  of  production  itself)

consummates the individualization of the form of surplus value, the

ossification of its form as opposed to its substance, its essence.

    One  portion  of  profit,  as  opposed  to  the  other,  separates  itself

entirely from the relationship of capital as such and appears as arising

not out of the function of exploiting wage labor, but out of the wage

labor of the capitalist himself. In contrast thereto, interest then seems

to be independent both of the laborer’s wage labor and the capitalist’s

own labor, and to arise from capital as its own independent source. If

capital originally appeared on the surface of circulation as a fetishism

of capital, as a value-creating value, so it now appears again in the

form  of  interest-bearing  capital,  as  in  its  most  estranged  and

characteristic form. Wherefore also the formula capital — interest, as

the third to land — rent and labor — wages, is much more consistent

than capital — profit, since in profit there still remains a recollection ofits origin, which is not only extinguished in interest, but is also placed

in a form thoroughly antithetical to this origin.

    Finally,  capital  as  an  independent  source  of  surplus  value  is

joined by landed property, which acts as a barrier to average profit

and transfers a portion of surplus value to a class that neither works

itself,  nor  directly  exploits  labor,  nor  can  find  morally  edifying

rationalizations, as in the case of interest-bearing capital, e.g., risk and

sacrifice of lending capital to others. Since here a part of the surplus

value seems to be bound up directly with a natural element, the land,

rather than with social relations, the form of mutual estrangement and

ossification  of  the  various  parts  of  surplus  value  is  completed,  the

inner connection completely disrupted, and its source entirely buried,

precisely because the relations of production, which are bound to the

various  material  elements  of  the  production  process,  have  been

rendered mutually independent.

    In capital — profit, or still better capital — interest, land — rent,

labor — wages, in this economic trinity represented as the connection

between the component parts of value and wealth in general and its

sources, we have the complete mystification of the capitalist mode of

production,  the  conversion  of  social  relations  into  things,  the  direct

coalescence of the material production relations with their historical

and  social  determination.  It  is  an  enchanted,  perverted,  topsy-turvy

world,  in  which  Monsieur  le  Capital  and  Madame  la  Terre  do  their

ghost-walking as social characters and at the same time directly as

mere  things.  It  is  the  great  merit  of  classical  economy  to  have

destroyed  this  false  appearance  and  illusion,  this  mutual

independence  and  ossification  of  the  various  social  elements  of

wealth,  this  personification  of  things  and  conversion  of  production

relations  into  entities,  this  religion  of  everyday  life.  It  did  so  by

reducing interest to a portion of profit, and rent to the surplus above

average profit, so that both of them converge in surplus value; and by

representing the process of circulation as a mere metamorphosis of

forms, and finally reducing value and surplus value of commodities to

labor in the direct production process.

      Nevertheless,  even  the  best  spokesmen  of  classical  economy

remain  more  or  less  in  the  grip  of  the  world  of  illusion  which  their

criticism  had  dissolved,  as  cannot  be  otherwise  from  a  bourgeoisstandpoint,  and  thus  they  all  fall  more  or  less  into  inconsistencies,

half-truths and unsolved contradictions. On the other hand, it is just as

natural for the actual agents of production to feel completely at home

in these estranged and irrational forms of capital — interest, land —

rent, labor — wages, since these are precisely the forms of illusion in

which they move about and find their daily occupation. It is therefore

just as natural that vulgar economy, which is no more than a didactic,

more  or  less  dogmatic,  translation  of  everyday  conceptions  of  the

actual  agents  of  production,  and  which  arranges  them  in  a  certain

rational order, should see precisely in this trinity, which is devoid of all

inner connection, the natural and indubitable lofty basis for its shallow

pompousness.  This  formula  simultaneously  corresponds  to  the

interests of the ruling classes by proclaiming the physical necessity

and eternal justification of their sources of revenue and elevating them

to a dogma.

    In our description of how production relations are converted into

entities  and  rendered  independent  in  relation  to  the  agents  of

production, we leave aside the manner in which the interrelations, due

to the world market, its conjunctures, movements of market prices,

periods  of  credit,  industrial  and  commercial  cycles,  alternations  of

prosperity and crisis, appear to them as overwhelming natural laws

that irresistibly enforce their will over them, and confront them as blind

necessity.  We  leave  this  aside  because  the  actual  movement  of

competition belongs beyond our scope, and we need present only the

inner  organization  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  in  its  ideal

average, as it were [...]

1984 or Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, is a dystopian novel by English novelist George

Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949. 1984 is one of George Orwell's most powerful

politically charged novels, a beautifully crafted warning against the dangers of a totalitarian

society, and one of the most famous novels in the dystopian genre. Winston Smith is a low-

ranking member of the ruling party in London whose every move is monitored by telescreens.

Everywhere Winston goes, the party's omniscient leader, Big Brother, watches him. This is an

important novel not only for its stark warning against abusive authority (and its somewhat

ironic contribution to modern television content), but also for its insights into the power of

manipulating language, history, and the psychology of fear and control. These issues are

perhaps even more pertinent today than when Orwell penned his novel.

George Orwell was a novelist, essayist and critic best known for his novels Animal Farm and

Nineteen Eighty-Four. He was a man of strong opinions who addressed some of the major

political movements of his times, including imperialism, fascism and communism. Animal

Farm was published in 1945 when Orwell, a democratic socialist, was angered at Joseph

Stalin for betraying the ideas of the Russian Revolution. In fact, that is the basis of Orwell's

book. The characters in Animal Farm resemble significant people that impacted the Russian

Revolution. These characters act similarly to the real people and actions that were done in the

past. Through this book, George Orwell exposes Stalin's true nature and evils using a corrupt

pig named Napoleon that eventually dictates the farm. Animal Farm is one of the most

influential political texts ever written.
