═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that there are distinct types of numbers-finite and transfinite-and that these can be understood through different conceptual frameworks, including inductive and non-inductive definitions, as well as through the concept of reflexive classes.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Finite Numbers as Inductive Numbers**:
   - The text argues that finite numbers are inductive, meaning they can be generated by starting with a base element (e.g., 0) and applying a successor operation a finite number of times. This is supported by the definition of the natural numbers (ℕ) as the smallest class containing 0 and n+1 whenever it contains n.

2. **Transfinite Numbers as Non-Inductive Numbers**:
   - Transfinite numbers are defined as non-inductive, meaning they cannot be reached by applying a successor operation a finite number of times. The text uses the example of the cardinal number of ℕ (ℵ₀) to illustrate this, arguing that starting from 0 and applying the successor operation a finite number of times will never reach ℵ₀.

3. **Transfinite Numbers as the Numbers of Reflexive Classes**:
   - The text introduces a second definition of transfinite numbers as the numbers of reflexive classes, which are classes that can be bijected with a proper subset of themselves. Examples given include the set of even numbers and the set of prime numbers, both of which can be bijected with ℕ.

4. **Two Conceptions of Class-Size**:
   - The text argues that there are two legitimate ways to understand the size of a class: one based on the existence of a bijection between classes, and another that also requires that neither class can be bijected with a proper subset of the other. This argument supports the thesis by providing a framework for understanding the size of infinite sets.

5. **Three Orders of Magnitude**:
   - The text categorizes numbers into three orders of magnitude: finite, infinite and recursive, and infinite and non-recursive. This categorization supports the thesis by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of numbers.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Enumerable vs. Non-Denumerable Sets**:
   - The text discusses the distinction between enumerable (countably infinite) and non-denumerable (uncountably infinite) sets, which is a subsidiary claim supporting the broader argument about the nature of transfinite numbers.

2. **The Power-Set Theorem**:
   - The text mentions the power-set theorem, which states that the power set of a set K has a cardinality of 2^[K]. This is a subsidiary claim that supports the argument about the size of infinite sets.

3. **Cardinal Arithmetic**:
   - The text briefly touches on cardinal arithmetic, including operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division for transfinite numbers. This supports the thesis by providing a framework for working with transfinite numbers.

4. **Ordinal Numbers and Ordinal Transfinite Arithmetic**:
   - The text introduces ordinal numbers and their arithmetic, which is a subsidiary claim that supports the broader argument about the nature of transfinite numbers and their ordering.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Existence of Infinite Sets**: The text assumes the existence of infinite sets, which is a foundational assumption in set theory.

2. **Acceptance of the Axiom of Choice**: The text implicitly assumes the axiom of choice, which is necessary for many of the arguments about bijections and cardinalities.

3. **Consistency of Set Theory**: The text assumes the consistency of set theory, particularly Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), which is the standard framework for discussing these concepts.

4. **Realism about Mathematical Objects**: The text assumes a realist stance towards mathematical objects, treating numbers and sets as existing independently of human thought.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction of Finite Numbers**: The text begins by defining finite numbers as inductive numbers, setting the stage for the discussion of transfinite numbers.

2. **Definition of Transfinite Numbers**: The text then introduces transfinite numbers, first as non-inductive numbers and then as the numbers of reflexive classes, providing two distinct but related definitions.

3. **Conceptions of Class-Size**: The text discusses two ways of understanding class-size, which is crucial for understanding the nature of transfinite numbers.

4. **Orders of Magnitude**: The text categorizes numbers into three orders of magnitude, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of numbers.

5. **Supporting Concepts and Theorems**: The text introduces supporting concepts like enumerable vs. non-denumerable sets, the power-set theorem, cardinal arithmetic, and ordinal numbers, which all contribute to the overall argument about the nature of numbers.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

The argument progresses from the basic definition of finite numbers to the more complex concepts of transfinite numbers and their properties. The text starts with the familiar concept of natural numbers and builds upon this to introduce the idea of transfinite numbers, first as non-inductive and then as the numbers of reflexive classes. The discussion of class-size and orders of magnitude further develops the argument, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of numbers. The text then introduces supporting concepts and theorems, which reinforce the main arguments and provide additional depth to the discussion.

### 8.2 Logical Dependencies Between Claims

The text's claims are logically dependent on each other in the following ways:

1. **Finite Numbers as Inductive Numbers**: The definition of finite numbers as inductive numbers is a foundational claim that sets the stage for the discussion of transfinite numbers.

2. **Transfinite Numbers as Non-Inductive Numbers**: The definition of transfinite numbers as non-inductive numbers depends on the definition of finite numbers as inductive numbers, as it is defined in contrast to finite numbers.

4. **Two Conceptions of Class-Size**: The discussion of the two conceptions of class-size depends on the definitions of finite and transfinite numbers, as it provides a framework for understanding the size of these numbers.

5. **Three Orders of Magnitude**: The categorization of numbers into three orders of magnitude depends on the previous definitions and conceptions, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of numbers.

### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions

The text progresses from premises to conclusions in the following way:

1. **Premise**: Finite numbers are inductive numbers, meaning they can be generated by starting with a base element and applying a successor operation a finite number of times.

2. **Premise**: Transfinite numbers are non-inductive numbers, meaning they cannot be generated by starting with a base element and applying a successor operation a finite number of times.

3. **Premise**: Transfinite numbers can also be defined as the numbers of reflexive classes, which are classes that can be bijected with a proper subset of themselves.

4. **Premise**: There are two legitimate ways to understand the size of a class: one based on the existence of a bijection between classes, and another that also requires that neither class can be bijected with a proper subset of the other.

5. **Conclusion**: Numbers can be categorized into three orders of magnitude: finite, infinite and recursive, and infinite and non-recursive, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the different types of numbers.

1. **Primary Thesis**: The text presents multiple propositions about the nature and cardinality of various sets of numbers, including integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. The overarching thesis is that different sets of numbers have different cardinalities, with some sets being enumerable and others non-enumerable.

### Primary arguments supporting the thesis
1. **Proposition: [ℤ]=[ℕ]**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the set of integers (ℤ) has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers (ℕ) by constructing a bijection between the two sets. The function ϕ maps natural numbers to integers in a way that covers all integers exactly once.
2. **Proposition: ℚ is recursive**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the set of rational numbers (ℚ) is recursive by constructing a series that includes all rational numbers and defining a function ϕ that bijects the natural numbers with the rational numbers. This series is ordered based on a specific rule, ensuring that every rational number appears in the series.
3. **Proposition: ℝ is non-denumerable**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the set of real numbers (ℝ) is non-denumerable by constructing a diagonal argument that shows any attempt to list all real numbers will fail to include some real numbers. This argument demonstrates that there is no bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.
4. **Proposition: [PK]>[K]**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the power set of any set K has a greater cardinality than K itself. This is demonstrated through a proof by contradiction, showing that any attempt to construct a bijection between K and PK will fail.

### Secondary arguments and subsidiary claims

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the power set of any class K, denoted as PK, is always larger than the class K itself, and that this relationship holds for both finite and infinite classes. This leads to the conclusion that there are infinitely many orders of infinity.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Power Set of Any Class**: The text argues that for any class K, the power set PK contains the empty set ∅ as an element. This is proven by showing that ∅ is a subset of any class K, and thus must be an element of PK.

   - **Explanation**: The proof begins by defining the empty set ∅ and showing that it has no elements. It then argues that since ∅ has no elements, it cannot have any elements that are not also elements of K. Therefore, ∅ is a subset of K, and thus an element of PK.

2. **Cardinality of Power Sets**: The text argues that the cardinality of the power set PK is always 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of K, denoted as [PK] = 2^[K]. This is proven using induction for finite sets and extended to infinite sets.

   - **Explanation**: The proof starts with the base case where K is the empty set ∅, showing that [P∅] = 1. It then uses induction to show that for any finite set K with n elements, [PK] = 2^n. The argument is extended to infinite sets by showing that the same relationship holds.

3. **Infinite Orders of Infinity**: The text argues that since [PK] > [K] for any class K, there must be infinitely many orders of infinity. This is supported by the fact that the power set operation can be applied repeatedly to generate larger and larger sets.

   - **Explanation**: The text shows that applying the power set operation to any set K results in a set PK that is larger than K. By repeatedly applying this operation, one can generate an infinite sequence of sets, each larger than the last, demonstrating the existence of infinitely many orders of infinity.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Continuum Hypothesis**: The text discusses the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that the cardinality of the real numbers ℝ is equal to the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers ℕ, i.e., [ℝ] = [Pℕ] = ℵ₁.

   - **Explanation**: The text presents the Continuum Hypothesis as a position that asserts a specific relationship between the cardinalities of the real numbers and the power set of the natural numbers. It notes that this hypothesis is still an open problem in mathematics.

2. **Generalized Continuum Hypothesis**: The text also mentions the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis, which extends the Continuum Hypothesis to any infinitely large class K, stating that [PK] is the smallest number greater than [K].

   - **Explanation**: This hypothesis generalizes the idea of the Continuum Hypothesis to all infinite sets, asserting that the power set of any infinite set is the next largest cardinality after the set itself.

3. **Cardinal Arithmetic**: The text discusses the arithmetic of cardinal numbers, showing that addition and multiplication of cardinals are commutative and distinct from their ordinal counterparts.

   - **Explanation**: The text explains that cardinal addition and multiplication involve the union and Cartesian product of sets, respectively. It contrasts these operations with ordinal arithmetic, noting that the distinction between cardinals and ordinals became important in the development of transfinite arithmetic.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Axiom of Extensionality**: The text assumes the Axiom of Extensionality, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. This is implicit in the discussion of the empty set and the power set operation.

2. **Axiom of Power Set**: The text assumes the Axiom of Power Set, which states that for any set, there exists a set of all its subsets. This is fundamental to the argument about the power set operation.

3. **Existence of Infinite Sets**: The text assumes the existence of infinite sets, which is necessary for the discussion of transfinite numbers and the Continuum Hypothesis.

4. **Consistency of Set Theory**: The text assumes the consistency of set theory, particularly Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), which is the standard foundation for modern set theory.

   - **Explanation**: The empty set is a fundamental concept in set theory, and its inclusion in any power set is a key result used to establish the main thesis.

2. **Subset and Power Set**: The text distinguishes between subsets and power sets, defining a subset as a class with no elements not in the original class, and the power set as the set of all subsets of a given class.

   - **Explanation**: These distinctions are crucial for understanding the power set operation and the subsequent arguments about cardinalities.

3. **Finite and Infinite Sets**: The text distinguishes between finite and infinite sets, showing that the main thesis holds for both types of sets.

   - **Explanation**: This distinction is important for extending the results from finite sets to infinite sets, which is a key part of the argument.

   - **Explanation**: This strategy is used to prove the base case and then show that the result holds for all finite sets by induction.

2. **Reductio ad Absurdum**: The text implicitly uses reductio ad absurdum in the proof that the empty set is unique, showing that if there were two different empty sets, they would have to differ in some way, which is impossible.

   - **Explanation**: This strategy is used to establish the uniqueness of the empty set, which is a key assumption in the subsequent arguments.

3. **Modus Ponens**: The text uses modus ponens in the proofs, such as in the proof that the empty set is a subset of any class, where it is shown that if a class has no elements, then it must be a subset of any other class.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that transfinite cardinal and ordinal arithmetic exhibit unique properties that differ significantly from their finite counterparts, particularly in terms of commutativity and the nature of operations like subtraction and division.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Cardinal Arithmetic Properties**:
   - The text argues that for any transfinite cardinal ℵ, ℵ multiplied by any finite number n remains ℵ. This is supported by the statement "ℵ×2=ℵ. For any finite n, obvious generalizations of this reasoning establish that ℵ×n=ℵ."
   - It further asserts that ℵ multiplied by ℵ equals ℵ, indicating that transfinite cardinals do not follow the same arithmetic rules as finite numbers.

2. **Ambiguity in Subtraction and Division**:
   - The text claims that subtraction and division of transfinite cardinals are infinitely ambiguous. This is supported by the statement "If A and B are transfinite cardinals, A−B is infinitely ambiguous, and so is A÷B."
   - Examples are provided to illustrate how different definitions of A and B can lead to different results, such as A−B=0, A−B=1, A−B=2, and A÷B=ℵ or A÷B=1.

3. **Ordinal Arithmetic Properties**:
   - The text argues that ordinal numbers represent positions in a series and that their arithmetic properties differ from those of finite numbers. This is supported by the statement "Just as a cardinal number is the number of a class, an ordinal number is the number of a series."
   - It further asserts that addition and multiplication of ordinals are not commutative for transfinite ordinals, unlike for finite ordinals. This is supported by the statement "Addition and multiplication are commutative where finite ordinals are concerned but not where transfinite ordinals are concerned."

4. **Non-Commutativity of Transfinite Ordinal Operations**:
   - The text provides examples to show that rearranging the members of an infinite series can change its ordinal number, leading to non-commutative operations. This is supported by the statement "If S is an infinitely long series, rearranging S's members may yield a series S* that does not contain the same number of elements as S."
   - Specific examples are given, such as "Let S be (ℕ, <). So S is the series: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... And let S* be the series 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5... S and S* obviously have the same number of members."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Importance of Ordinal Numbers**:
   - The text claims that ordinal numbers are crucial because they represent the serial nature of sets, which is essential for understanding the structure of infinite series. This is supported by the statement "An ordinal number is a serial number, i.e. it is the number of a series."

2. **Generalization of Ordinal Arithmetic**:
   - The text suggests that the properties of ordinal arithmetic can be generalized to other types of series, such as those involving pairs or higher-dimensional structures. This is supported by the statement "More generally, addition and multiplication are commutative where scalar (one-dimensional) magnitudes are concerned, but not, except under special circumstances, where vector (n-dimensional, for n>1) magnitudes are concerned."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Acceptance of Transfinite Numbers**: The text assumes that the reader accepts the existence and utility of transfinite numbers, as introduced by Cantor.

2. **Understanding of Set Theory**: The text assumes a basic understanding of set theory, including concepts like cardinality and ordinality, which are foundational to the arguments presented.

3. **Formalism in Mathematics**: The text implicitly assumes a formalist approach to mathematics, where the focus is on the manipulation of symbols and the formal properties of numbers rather than their intuitive or semantic content.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text follows a logical structure that begins with an introduction to cardinal arithmetic, moves to the ambiguity of subtraction and division, and then transitions to ordinal arithmetic. The argument progresses from specific examples to general principles, culminating in a discussion of the importance of ordinal numbers and their broader implications.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text
