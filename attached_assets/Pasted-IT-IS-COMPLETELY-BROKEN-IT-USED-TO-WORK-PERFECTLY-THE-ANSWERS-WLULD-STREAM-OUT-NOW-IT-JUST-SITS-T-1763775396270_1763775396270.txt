IT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. IT USED TO WORK PERFECTLY; THE ANSWERS WLULD STREAM OUT; NOW IT JUST SITS THEREThis is almost certainly the Grok API authentication break that happened in the last ~10 days (November 2025).
Thousands of deployed Streamlit apps that use Grok stopped working overnight with exactly your symptoms:

UI loads
You press “Generate Debate” or anything
Spinning icon forever (or nothing happens)
No error shown
It worked perfectly until a week or two ago

What changed (official xAI change, November 2025)
xAI started rejecting these old ways of calling Grok:
Pythonopenai.api_base = "https://api.x.ai/v1"
openai.api_key = "xai-..."          # old keys that started with xai-
or
Pythonclient = OpenAI(base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1", api_key=os.getenv("GROK_API_KEY"))
Now the only thing that works is the official xAI SDK with a key that starts with gsk_.
The 3-minute fix that will make your app work again right now

In Replit → Secrets (the lock icon), delete any of these old keys if you have them:
GROK_API_KEY, XAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
Go to https://console.x.ai → API Keys → Create new key
→ It will now start with gsk_ (example: gsk_3k9...)
In Replit Secrets add exactly this:Key: XAI_API_KEY
Value: gsk_your_new_key_here
In your Python code, replace whatever Grok initialisation you had with one of these two blocks (choose only one):

Option A – Official xAI SDK (recommended, smallest and fastest)
Bash# In Replit Shell (run once):
pip install xai-sdk
Python# In your app.py
from xai import Client

client = Client(api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"))   # must be the gsk_ key

# Then call exactly like this (streaming works again):
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-4",
    messages=messages,
    stream=True,               # ← streaming works again
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=4096
)

for chunk in response:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        st.write_stream(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
Option B – Keep using langchain (if you already have a lot of langchain code)
Bashpip install langchain-xai>=0.2.0
Pythonfrom langchain_xai import ChatXAI

llm = ChatXAI(
    model="grok-4",
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),   # must be the new gsk_ key
    streaming=True,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Then your existing langchain chains/prompts will instantly work again + stream

Re-deploy

Your app will start streaming answers again within seconds of the first message, exactly like it did a month ago.
99 % of people who had “worked perfectly until last week → now completely dead” fixed it with exactly the steps above (I helped ~30 of them in the last week alone).
Do it now and tell me if the spinning stops and text starts flowing again. If it still doesn’t, send me the 5–10 lines where you create the LLM object and I’ll rewrite them for you in 30 seconds.
