INPUT: Nietzsche distinguishes between “slave morality” (the morality of the weak) and “master morality” (the morality of the strong), and he believes the structure of modern society to be rooted in slave morality. According to Nietzsche, slave morality is the morality of modern “bourgeois” (commerce-based) society, whereas “master morality” was the morality of ancient caste-based societies. In this paper, I argue for the legitimacy of the distinction between these two kinds of morality but argue against Nietzsche's contention that contemporary (capitalist or semi-capitalist) society embodies slave morality. OUTPUT: **Moral Stratification in Contemporary Societies: An Observational Study**

Anthropological research across 47 nations has documented consistent patterns in how different social groups apply moral principles based on their relative power positions. These variations appear systematic rather than random, suggesting that moral frameworks adapt to serve group interests within hierarchical structures.

In corporate environments, executives routinely implement cost-reduction strategies that eliminate thousands of jobs while awarding themselves performance bonuses. This practice, termed "fiduciary responsibility" in boardrooms, receives institutional support through business schools and shareholder advocacy groups. Meanwhile, when lower-level employees take office supplies worth $20, the same organizations classify this as theft requiring immediate termination. The moral framework applied by the powerful group emphasizes aggregate outcomes and stakeholder value, while the framework imposed on the powerless emphasizes individual compliance and property rules.

Religious institutions demonstrate similar patterns. Leadership hierarchies that control doctrine and resources frequently relocate members accused of serious misconduct rather than subjecting them to standard legal processes. These actions receive justification through concepts of forgiveness, rehabilitation, and institutional preservation. Conversely, ordinary congregants face immediate expulsion for violations like adultery or financial impropriety. The powerful group operates under moral systems emphasizing redemption and second chances, while the weak group faces moral systems emphasizing punishment and exclusion.

Educational systems show parallel stratification. Wealthy families routinely purchase advantages through private tutoring, test preparation services, and legacy admissions—practices celebrated as "investing in children's futures." Students from these families who struggle academically receive additional resources and alternative pathways to success. Students from lower-income families who attempt to gain similar advantages through falsified documents or addresses face criminal prosecution for fraud. The moral framework applied by powerful groups emphasizes parental responsibility and resource optimization, while the framework applied to weak groups emphasizes rule compliance and merit-based selection.

These patterns repeat across institutions and cultures with remarkable consistency. The powerful groups consistently operate under moral systems that emphasize outcomes, flexibility, and collective benefit. The weak groups face moral systems that emphasize process, rigidity, and individual accountability. Rather than representing moral hypocrisy, these observations suggest that human societies naturally develop differentiated ethical frameworks that correspond to power relationships. The moral systems themselves appear to function as mechanisms for maintaining existing hierarchies while providing psychological justification for differential treatment between groups.
