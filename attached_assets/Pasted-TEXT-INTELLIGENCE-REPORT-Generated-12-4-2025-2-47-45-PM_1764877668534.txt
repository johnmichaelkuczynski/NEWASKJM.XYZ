--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: The occurrence of 'absolute' in 'the absolute is one' is not a word but a mere homonym.
   EVIDENCE: "What occurs in 'the absolute is one' is not the word 'absolute', but a mere homonym of that word."

2. VIEW: For 'absolute' in 'the absolute is one' to be a word, it would require a semantic rule assigning it a meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "For the occurrence of 'absolute' in 'the absolute is one' to be a word, there would have to be some semantic rule that assigned it a meaning."

3. VIEW: The occurrence of 'absolute' in 'the absolute is one' is assigned no meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "Although there are semantic rules that assign meaning to homonyms of that occurrence, that occurrence per se is assigned no meaning."

4. VIEW: Anything that is assigned no meaning is not a linguistic expression.
   EVIDENCE: "Anything that is assigned no meaning is ipso facto not a linguistic expression."

5. VIEW: 'The absolute is one' is not a sentence but a sentence-imposter.
   EVIDENCE: "So 'the absolute is one' is not a sentence, but a sentence-imposter."

6. VIEW: The meaning of a true or false sentence is a proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "The meaning of a true or false sentence is a proposition."

7. VIEW: Propositions are not themselves sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "Propositions are not themselves sentences."

8. VIEW: Different sentences can express the same proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "That is why different sentences (e.g., 'schnee ist weiss' and 'snow is white') can express the same proposition."

9. VIEW: Propositions, when true, are truths.
   EVIDENCE: "Propositions, when true, are truths."

10. VIEW: Propositions have existed as long as there have been truths.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, propositions have existed as long as there have been truths; which means that they've existed as long as there has been anything and, consequently, that propositions are not creations of human creations."

11. VIEW: Propositions are structurally similar to the sentences that express them.
   EVIDENCE: "Though distinct from the sentences that express them, propositions are structurally similar to them."

12. VIEW: The thing meant by 'John' in different sentences can move from one sentence-meaning to another.
   EVIDENCE: "The thing meant by 'John' must be capable of moving on its own from sentence-meaning to sentence-meaning."

13. VIEW: Propositions consist of discrete parts that correspond to discrete parts of sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "It follows that propositions consist of discrete parts; it also follows that those discrete parts correspond to discrete parts of the sentences that express them."

14. VIEW: Sentences are structurally like the propositions they express.
   EVIDENCE: "Taken together, these two points entail that sentences are structurally like the propositions they express."

15. VIEW: Propositions are digital structures.
   EVIDENCE: "Given that propositions consist of discrete, isolable entities, it follows that, like sentences and unlike visual perceptions and photographs, propositions are digital structures."

16. VIEW: Sentences and propositions have unique breakdowns into minimal significant units.
   EVIDENCE: "Sentences and propositions are digital structures, meaning that they have unique breakdowns into minimal significant units."

17. VIEW: Visual perceptions have non-digital or analogue structures.
   EVIDENCE: "Visual perceptions, unlike sentences and propositions, therefore have a non-digital or analogue structures."

18. VIEW: Thought at least sometimes has a structure very different from language.
   EVIDENCE: "Given that at least some thought involves the processing of perceptual information, it follows that thought at least sometimes has a structure very different from language."

19. VIEW: The study of language is divided into semantics, syntax, and pragmatics.
   EVIDENCE: "The study of language is typically divided into three sub-disciplines-semantics, syntax, and pragmatics."

20. VIEW: Semantics, syntax, and pragmatics each denote both a branch of linguistic study and a dimension of language.
   EVIDENCE: "In addition to denoting a branch of linguistic study, each of these three words denotes dimension of language."

21. VIEW: The meaning of 'Sally hates Bob' depends on the meaning of 'hates'.
   EVIDENCE: "This shows that what 'Sally hates Bob' means depends on what 'hates' means."

22. VIEW: The sentence 'Larry loves Julie' does not mean the same thing as 'Sally hates Bob'.
   EVIDENCE: "Obviously this sentence doesn't mean the same thing as 'Sally hates Bob.'"

23. VIEW: The relationship between the meaning of 'Sally hates Bob' and 'hates' is the same as the relationship between the meaning of 'Larry loves Julie' and 'loves'.
   EVIDENCE: "But the relationship borne by the meaning of 'Sally hates Bob' to the meaning 'hates' is identical with the relationship borne by the meaning of 'Larry loves Julie' to that of 'loves.'"

24. VIEW: Similar points about meaning relationships hold for the other constituents of the sentences 'Sally hates Bob' and 'Larry loves Julie'.
   EVIDENCE: "Exactly similar points hold in connection with each of the remaining two constituents of each of those sentences."

25. VIEW: Syntax studies the relation between the meanings of complex expressions and the meanings of the simple expressions composing them.
   EVIDENCE: "The discipline of syntax studies the relation that the meanings of complex expressions bear to the meanings of the simple expressions composing them."

26. VIEW: Syntax does not study the semantics of complex expressions.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, syntax doesn't study the semantics (meanings) of complex expressions."

27. VIEW: Syntax studies the structures of the semantics of complex expressions.
   EVIDENCE: "It studies the structures of the semantics of complex expressions."

28. VIEW: Syntax studies semantic structure.
   EVIDENCE: "Syntax studies semantic structure."

29. VIEW: Semanticists supply us with metaknowledge about what we know when we understand sentences.
   EVIDENCE: "Semanticists supply us with the missing metaknowledge."

30. VIEW: The sentence 'John wants to punch Bob' attributes a property to John.
   EVIDENCE: "(2) attributes a certain property to John-that of wanting to punch Bob."

31. VIEW: The sentences 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' and 'John wants to punch Bob' are grammatically isomorphic.
   EVIDENCE: "Given that (1) and (2) are grammatically isomorphic..."

32. VIEW: The proposition expressed by 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' is not about a specific fish.
   EVIDENCE: "But this isn't the right analysis. There isn't some one fish such that, if the desire ascribed to John by (1) is to be gratified, John must catch that very fish."

33. VIEW: The meaning of 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' is about the existence of a relationship between John and a proposition.
   EVIDENCE: "It affirms the existence of a relationship between John and a proposition."

34. VIEW: The proposition expressed by 'there exists some fish x such that x is a 20-pound striped bass and such that John catches x' exists regardless of whether John catches the fish.
   EVIDENCE: "But that proposition exists either way."

35. VIEW: The expression 'some fish' in the sentence 'there exists some fish x such that x is a 20-pound striped bass and such that John catches x' does not refer to any specific fish.
   EVIDENCE: "Grammatically, that expression is a noun-phrase. But, unlike other noun-phrases, it doesn't refer to anything."

36. VIEW: The problem of the meaning of 'some fish' can be solved by rewording the sentence to focus on the instantiation of a property.
   EVIDENCE: "The needed rewording is this: (5) The property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches is instantiated."

37. VIEW: The sentence 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' is about an existent property, not a non-existent fish.
   EVIDENCE: "So (1), which seemed to be about a non-existent fish, is about an existent property."

38. VIEW: A complete analysis of 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' involves the instantiation of the property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, a complete analysis of (1) is given by: (1CA) John wants it to be the case that the property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches is instantiated."

39. VIEW: Understanding the meaning of 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' is not trivial.
   EVIDENCE: "So even though just about every English speaker understands (1), knowing what it is that one knows in understanding it isn't such a trivial thing."

40. VIEW: Every English speaker knows what 'John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass' means.
   EVIDENCE: "Despite everything just said, there is clearly a sense in which every English speaker knows what (1) means."

41. VIEW: Something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it.
   EVIDENCE: "something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it."

42. VIEW: In a world without animate beings, a twig deposit of '1 + 1 = 2' would not be an expression.
   EVIDENCE: "In a world where there were no animate beings, but in which the forthcoming parenthetical ink deposit (1 + 1 = 2) was formed out of twigs, that twig deposit wouldn't be an expression of any kind."

43. VIEW: A twig deposit would be an expression if and only if it were endowed with meaning.
   EVIDENCE: "That twig deposit would be an expression if and only if it were endowed with meaning."

44. VIEW: Something has to have meaning in order to be an expression.
   EVIDENCE: "This shows that something has to have meaning in order to be an expression."

45. VIEW: Expressions aren't assigned meanings; they already have them.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, expressions aren't assigned meanings. They already have them and don't need to be assigned them."

46. VIEW: A semantic rule can't be defined as a rule that assigns a meaning to an expression.
   EVIDENCE: "Therefore a semantic rule can't be defined as a rule that assigns a meaning to an expression."

47. VIEW: Semantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, semantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions."

48. VIEW: Semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects.
   EVIDENCE: "Thus semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects-to morphological or acoustical properties (in other words, to properties that a things has in virtue of having a certain shape or sounding a certain way)."

49. VIEW: A semantic rule is something which assigns a meaning to a property.
   EVIDENCE: "A semantic rule is therefore something which assigns a meaning to a property, and language is a set of such rules."

50. VIEW: Language is a set of semantic rules.
   EVIDENCE: "A semantic rule is therefore something which assigns a meaning to a property, and language is a set of such rules."

51. VIEW: Many believe that linguistic meaning is to be understood in function-theoretic terms.
   EVIDENCE: "Many believe that linguistic meaning is to be understood in function-theoretic terms-that, in other words, semantic rules are mathematical functions."

52. VIEW: A function is a rule that assigns no more than one object to any given member of a class.
   EVIDENCE: "In general, a function is a rule that, given some class of objects, assigns no more than one object to any given member of that class."

53. VIEW: The word 'assigns' has a psychological meaning in the context of a person assigning a task.
   EVIDENCE: "In the former case, the word 'assigns' has a psychological meaning; in the latter, it has a non-psychological, purely logical meaning."

54. VIEW: The word 'assigns' has a non-psychological, purely logical meaning in the context of mathematical functions.
   EVIDENCE: "In the former case, the word 'assigns' has a psychological meaning; in the latter, it has a non-psychological, purely logical meaning."

55. VIEW: The rule that assigns 8 to <4,4> isn't a social rule and can't be obeyed or disobeyed.
   EVIDENCE: "A related point is that the rule that assigns 8 to <4,4> isn't a social rule, and it therefore isn't something that can be obeyed or disobeyed."

56. VIEW: According to the function-theoretic view, semantic rules are mathematical functions.
   EVIDENCE: "According to the function-theoretic view, semantic rules are rules in the strictly logical sense; that is, they are mathematical functions."

57. VIEW: The semantic rule for 'Socrates' is a function that assigns a certain individual to that word.
   EVIDENCE: "The semantic rule for 'Socrates' is a function that assigns a certain individual (Socrates) to that word (or to occurrences thereof)."

58. VIEW: The semantic rule for 'snow is white' is a function that assigns truth-conditions to that utterance.
   EVIDENCE: "The semantic rule for 'snow is white' is a function that assigns truth-conditions to that utterance (or to occurrences thereof)."

59. VIEW: The function-theoretic view of semantic rules is false.
   EVIDENCE: "The just-described view is false."

60. VIEW: The rule denoted by '+' has always existed and always will.
   EVIDENCE: "The rule denoted by '+' has always existed and always will."

61. VIEW: The meaning of a sentence determines what inferences can be made from it, not the other way around.
   EVIDENCE: "But it's only because of what the sentence already means that one can make those inferences."

62. VIEW: CRS (the theory that what a sentence means is determined by what we infer from it) is false.
   EVIDENCE: "Since it's the other way around, as we've just seen, CRS is false."

63. VIEW: Literal and understood meaning can diverge significantly for complex expressions.
   EVIDENCE: "Where complex expressions are concerned, there is no limit to how much literal and understood meaning may diverge from each other."

64. VIEW: Literal and understood meaning must be the same for simple expressions.
   EVIDENCE: "But where simple expressions are concerned, literal and understood meaning must coalesce."

65. VIEW: Systematic, widespread error in understanding the meaning of simple expressions is impossible.
   EVIDENCE: "It makes no sense to suppose that people could be systematically wrong as to what 'red' meant."

66. VIEW: If people systematically misunderstand a simple expression, the meaning of that expression would be what people think it means.
   EVIDENCE: "If people thought that 'red' meant what is in fact meant by 'blue,' then 'red' would have that meaning."

67. VIEW: Misinterpretations of sentences do not arise from failing to understand the meanings of simple parts but from failing to understand how to combine those meanings.
   EVIDENCE: "Even though there can be widespread, systematic misinterpretations of sentences, those misinterpretations do not arise as a result of people failing to know what the simple parts of sentences mean."

68. VIEW: The meaning of a sentence like 'Socrates was more wise than Plato, but he was less sharp then Aristotle' is understood by English speakers to the extent that its form and the meanings of its parts are understood.
   EVIDENCE: "So to the extent that its meaning is fixed by the fact that it has the form ‹...Socrates...›, people (English speakers) do systematically understand 'Socrates was more wise than Plato, but he was less sharp then Aristotle'."

69. VIEW: Systematic misunderstanding of a sentence occurs because people struggle to combine the meanings of its parts.
   EVIDENCE: "So far as that sentence is systematically misunderstood, it is because people are having trouble putting the meanings of its constituents together."

70. VIEW: The literal meaning of a simple expression is determined by what sentences containing it are taken to mean.
   EVIDENCE: "What a simple expression literally means is determined by what it is that a sentence means by virtue of containing it."

71. VIEW: The literal meaning of a simple expression coincides with what people take it to mean.
   EVIDENCE: "Since, where simple expressions are concerned, what people take literal meaning to be coincides with what it really is."

72. VIEW: The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its parts.
   EVIDENCE: "So a simple expression's literal meaning is given by a statement saying what it is that, by virtue of containing it, sentences are taken to mean; and a complex expression's literal meaning is a function, in the mathematical sense, of the meanings of its parts."

73. VIEW: The meaning of 'Socrates' is determined by what people think it means.
   EVIDENCE: "So what people think it means must ultimately coincide with what it actually means."

74. VIEW: The meaning of 'Socrates' refers to Socrates because people think it does.
   EVIDENCE: "So it refers to Socrates only because people think it refers to Socrates."

75. VIEW: The literal meaning of a complex expression can diverge from its understood meaning due to how people interpret the arrangement of its parts.
   EVIDENCE: "How people interpret CE may diverge from its literal meaning. But when this happens, it's because what it is taken to mean diverges from what, given what people believe its simple parts to literally mean, people are disposed to take it to mean."

76. VIEW: The literal meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its simple parts and their arrangement.
   EVIDENCE: "The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of two things: (i) the meanings of its simple parts, and (ii) the order in which those parts are arranged."

77. VIEW: Simple expressions mean what people take them to mean.
   EVIDENCE: "Where simple expressions are concerned, literal and communicated meaning coincide (ultimately)-in other words, such expressions mean what people take them to mean."

78. VIEW: For complex expressions, literal meaning may diverge from communicated meaning, but it coincides with what people are disposed to take it to mean based on the literal meanings of its simple parts.
   EVIDENCE: "And where complex expressions are concerned, literal and communicated meaning may diverge, but literal meaning nonetheless coincides with what, given what the simple components of the expression in question literally mean, people are disposed to take it to mean."

79. VIEW: No word is identical with any utterance of it.
   EVIDENCE: "No word is identical with any utterance of it."

80. VIEW: Utterances and inscriptions of expressions are referred to as 'expression-tokens'.
   EVIDENCE: "Utterances and inscriptions of expressions are referred to as 'expression-tokens' (or just 'tokens')."
