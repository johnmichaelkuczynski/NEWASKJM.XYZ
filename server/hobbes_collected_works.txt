Malmesbury, 
a 
market 
town 
in 
Wiltshire 
— 
Thomas 
Hobbes 
was 
born 
in 
Westport, 
a 
village 
in 
Wiltshire, 
immediately 
west 
of 
Malmesbury. 
Westport 
no 
longer 
exists 
as 
a 
separate 
village 
and 
it 
is 
not 
named 
on 
modern 
maps. 
The 
built-up 
area 
was 
incorporated 
in 
the 
borough 
of 
Malmesbury 
in 
1934.

Elements 
of 
Law, 
Natural 
and 
Politic 



Thomas 
Hobbes 
was 
an 
accomplished 
pupil 
and 
in 
1603 
he 
enrolled 
at 
Magdalen 
Hall, 
the 
predecessor 
college 
to 
Hertford 
College, 
Oxford, 
where 
the 
principal 
was 
John 
Wilkinson, 
a 
Puritan, 
who 
had 
some 
influence 
on 
Hobbes’ 
early 
development. 
The 
pupil 
appears 
to 
have 
followed 
his 
own 
curriculumandhewas 
“littleattracted 
bythescholasticlearning”,completing 
his 
B.A. 
degree 
in 
1608. 
He 
was 
recommended 
by 
Sir 
James 
Hussey, 
his 
master 
at 
Magdalen, 
as 
tutor 
to 
William, 
the 
son 
of 
William 
Cavendish, 
Baron 
ofHardwickand 
beganalifelongconnectionwith 
thatfamily. 


Acting 
as 
companion 
to 
the 
younger 
William 
in 
1610, 
Hobbes 
took 
part 
in 
a 
grand 
tour 
of 
Europe, 
where 
he 
was 
exposed 
to 
European 
scientific 
and 
critical 
methods, 
offering 
a 
notable 
contrast 
to 
the 
scholastic 
philosophy 
that 
he 
had 
learned 
in 
Oxford. 
His 
scholarly 
pursuits 
at 
the 
time 
were 
aimed 
at 
a 
careful 
study 
of 
classic 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
authors. 
In 
June 
1628, 
his 
employer 
Cavendish, 
then 
the 
Earl 
of 
Devonshire, 
died 
of 
the 
plague 
and 
the 
widowed 
countess 
dismissed 
Hobbes. 


Over 
the 
next 
seven 
years, 
as 
well 
as 
tutoring, 
Hobbes 
expanded 
his 
knowledge 
of 
philosophy, 
awakening 
in 
him 
a 
curiosity 
in 
key 
philosophic 
debates. 
He 
visited 
Florence 
in 
1636 
and 
was 
later 
a 
regular 
debater 
in 
philosophic 
groups 
in 
Paris, 
conducted 
by 
Marin 
Mersenne. 
When 
Hobbes 
returned 
to 
England 
in 
1637, 
he 
found 
it 
a 
country 
riven 
with 
discontent, 
disrupting 
him 
from 
the 
orderly 
execution 
of 
his 
philosophic 
plan. 
However, 
by 
the 
end 
of 
Charles 
I’s 
calling 
of 
a 
Short 
Parliament 
in 
1640, 
he 
had 
completed 
a 
short 
treatise 
entitled 
The 
Elements 
of 
Law, 
Natural 
and 
Politic. 
It 
was 
not 
published 
and 
only 
circulated 
as 
a 
manuscript 
among 
his 
close 
associates. 
A 
pirated 
versionwaspublished 
tenyearslater. 



The 
Elements 
of 
Law 
is 
formed 
of 
two 
parts: 
Human 
Nature 
and 
De 
Corpore 
Politico. 
It 
is 
Hobbes’ 
first 
published 
philosophical 
work 
and 
was 
written 
in 
part 
as 
a 
response 
to 
the 
conflicts 
between 
Charles 
I 
and 
Parliament. 
The 
book 
details 
Hobbes’ 
initial 
attempt 
to 
address 
political 
matters 
with 
deductive 
methods 
of 
geometry, 
providing 
a 
definition 
of 
sovereigntythatremains 
central 
toHobbes’ 
laterpoliticalworks. 


Although 
it 
appears 
that 
much 
of 
the 
text 
was 
written 
prior 
to 
the 
sitting 
of 
the 
Short 
Parliament, 
there 
are 
polemical 
pieces 
of 
the 
work 
that 
reveal 
the 
influences 
of 
the 
rising 
political 
crisis. 
Nevertheless, 
many 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
Hobbes’ 
political 
thought 
would 
remain 
unchanged 
between 
the 
appearance 
of 
The 
Elements 
of 
Law 
and 
his 
magnum 
opus 
Leviathan, 
showing 
that 
the 
events 
of 
the 
English 
Civil 
War 
had 
little 
effect 
on 
his 
contractarian 
methodology. 


When 
in 
November 
1640 
the 
Long 
Parliament 
succeeded 
the 
Short, 
Hobbesfelt 
that 
hewasindisfavour 
dueto 
the 
circulationofhis 
controversial 
treatise 
and 
so 
he 
fled 
to 
Paris. 
He 
would 
not 
return 
to 
England 
for 
eleven 
years.

Dedication 


To 
the 
Right 
Honourable 
William, 
Earl 
of 
Newcastle, 
Governor 
to 
the 
Prince 
his 
Highness, 
one 
of 
His 
Majesty’s 
Most 
Honourable 
Privy 
Council 



MY 
MOST 
HONOURED 
Lord, 


From 
the 
two 
principal 
parts 
of 
our 
nature, 
Reason 
and 
Passion, 
have 
proceeded 
two 
kinds 
of 
learning, 
mathematical 
and 
dogmatical. 
The 
former 
is 
free 
from 
controversies 
and 
dispute, 
because 
it 
consisteth 
in 
comparing 
figuresandmotiononly;in 
whichthingstruthandtheinterestofmen, 
oppose 
not 
each 
other. 
But 
in 
the 
later 
there 
is 
nothing 
not 
disputable, 
because 
it 
compareth 
men, 
and 
meddleth 
with 
their 
right 
and 
profit; 
in 
which 
as 
oft 
as 
reason 
is 
against 
a 
man, 
so 
oft 
will 
a 
man 
be 
against 
reason. 
And 
from 
hence 
it 
comes, 
that 
they 
who 
have 
written 
of 
justice 
and 
policy 
in 
general 
do 
all 
invade 
each 
other, 
and 
themselves, 
with 
contradiction. 
To 
reduce 
this 
doctrine 
to 
the 
rules 
and 
infallibility 
of 
reason, 
there 
is 
no 
way, 
but 
first, 
to 
put 
such 
principles 
down 
for 
a 
foundation, 
as 
passion 
not 
mistrusting 
may 
not 
seek 
to 
displace: 
And 
afterward 
to 
build 
thereon 
the 
truth 
of 
cases 
in 
the 
law 
of 
nature 
(which 
hitherto 
have 
been 
built 
in 
the 
air) 
by 
degrees, 
till 
the 
whole 
be 
inexpugnable. 
Now 
(my 
Lord) 
the 
principles 
fit 
for 
such 
a 
foundation, 
are 
those 
which 
I 
have 
heretofore 
acquainted 
your 
Lordship 
withal 
in 
private 
discourse; 
and 
which, 
by 
your 
command 
I 
have 
here 
put 
into 
method. 
To 
examine 
cases 
thereby, 
between 
sovereign 
and 
sovereign, 
or 
between 
sovereign 
and 
subject, 
I 
leave 
to 
them, 
that 
shall 
find 
leisure, 
and 
encouragement 
thereto. 
For 
my 
part, 
I 
present 
this 
to 
your 
Lordship, 
for 
the 
true, 
and 
only 
foundation 
of 
such 
science. 
For 
the 
style, 
it 
is 
therefore 
the 



worse, 
because 
whilst 
I 
was 
writing 
I 
consulted 
more 
with 
logic, 
than 
with 
rhetoric. 
But 
for 
the 
doctrine, 
it 
is 
not 
slightly 
proved; 
and 
the 
conclusions 
thereof, 
are 
of 
such 
nature, 
as 
for 
want 
of 
them, 
government 
and 
peace 
have 
been 
nothing 
else, 
to 
this 
day, 
but 
mutual 
fear. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
an 
incomparable 
benefit 
to 
commonwealth, 
that 
every 
man 
held 
the 
opinions 
concerning 
law 
and 
policy, 
here 
delivered. 
The 
ambition 
therefore 
of 
this 
book, 
in 
seeking 
by 
your 
Lordship’s 
countenance, 
to 
insinuate 
itself 
with 
those 
whom 
the 
matter 
it 
containeth 
most 
nearly 
concerneth, 
is 
to 
be 
excused. 
For 
myself, 
I 
desire 
no 
greater 
honour, 
than 
I 
enjoy 
already 
in 
your 
Lordship’s 
known 
favour; 
unless 
it 
be, 
that 
you 
would 
be 
pleased 
in 
continuance 
thereof, 
to 
give 
me 
more 
exercise 
in 
your

Chapter 
1: 
The 
General 
Division 
of 
Man’s 
NaturalFaculties 



1. 
THE 
TRUE 
and 
perspicuous 
explication 
of 
the 
Elements 
of 
Laws, 
Natural 
and 
Politic, 
which 
is 
my 
present 
scope, 
dependeth 
upon 
the 
knowledge 
of 
what 
is 
human 
nature, 
what 
is 
a 
body 
politic, 
and 
what 
it 
is 
we 
call 
a 
law. 
Concerning 
which 
points, 
as 
the 
writings 
of 
men 
from 
antiquity 
downward 
have 
still 
increased, 
so 
also 
have 
the 
doubts 
and 
controversies 
concerning 
the 
same, 
and 
seeing 
that 
true 
knowledge 
begetteth 
not 
doubt, 
nor 
controversy, 
but 
knowledge; 
it 
is 
manifest 
from 
the 
present 
controversies, 
that 
they 
which 
haveheretoforewrittenthereof,havenotwell 
understoodtheirownsubject. 
2. 
Harm 
I 
can 
do 
none 
though 
I 
err 
no 
less 
than 
they. 
For 
I 
shall 
leave 
men 
but 
as 
they 
are 
in 
doubt 
and 
dispute. 
But 
intending 
not 
to 
take 
any 
principle 
upon 
trust, 
but 
only 
to 
put 
men 
in 
mind 
what 
they 
know 
already, 
or 
may 
know 
by 
their 
own 
experience, 
I 
hope 
to 
err 
the 
less; 
and 
when 
I 
do, 
it 
must 
proceed 
from 
too 
hasty 
concluding, 
which 
I 
will 
endeavour 
as 
much 
as 
I 
can 
toavoid. 
3. 
On 
the 
other 
side, 
if 
reasoning 
aright 
I 
win 
not 
consent 
(which 
may 
very 
easily 
happen) 
from 
them 
that 
being 
confident 
of 
their 
own 
knowledge 
weigh 
not 
what 
is 
said, 
the 
fault 
is 
not 
mine 
but 
theirs. 
For 
as 
it 
is 
my 
part 
to 
show 
myreasons,so 
itis 
theirs 
tobringattention. 
4. 
Man’s 
nature 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
his 
natural 
faculties 
and 
powers, 
as 
the 
faculties 
of 
nutrition, 
motion, 
generation, 
sense, 
reason, 
&c. 
For 
these 
powers 
we 
do 
unanimously 
call 
natural, 
and 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
man, 
underthesewords,animaland 
rational. 

5. 
According 
to 
the 
two 
principal 
parts 
of 
man, 
I 
divide 
his 
faculties 
into 
two 
sorts,faculties 
ofthebody,andfacultiesofthe 
mind. 
6. 
Since 
the 
minute 
and 
distinct 
anatomy 
of 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
body 
is 
nothing 
necessary 
to 
the 
present 
purpose, 
I 
will 
only 
sum 
them 
up 
into 
these 
threeheads,power 
nutritive,powermotive,andpower 
generative. 
7. 
Of 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
mind 
there 
be 
two 
sorts, 
cognitive 
or 
imaginative 
orconceptive;andmotive. 
Andfirst 
ofthecognitive. 
8. 
For 
the 
understanding 
of 
what 
I 
mean 
by 
the 
power 
cognitive, 
we 
must 
remember 
and 
acknowledge 
that 
there 
be 
in 
our 
minds 
continually 
certain 
images 
or 
conceptions 
of 
the 
things 
without 
us, 
insomuch 
that 
if 
a 
man 
could 
be 
alive, 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
annihilated, 
he 
should 
nevertheless 
retain 
the 
image 
thereof, 
and 
of 
all 
those 
things 
which 
he 
had 
before 
seen 
and 
perceivedin 
it; 
every 
man 
by 
hisownexperience 
knowingthatthe 
absence 
or 
destruction 
of 
things 
once 
imagined, 
doth 
not 
cause 
the 
absence 
or 
destruction 
of 
the 
imagination 
itself. 
This 
imagery 
and 
representations 
of 
the 
qualities 
of 
things 
without 
us 
is 
that 
we 
call 
our 
cognition, 
imagination, 
ideas, 
notice, 
conception, 
or 
knowledge 
of 
them. 
And 
the 
faculty, 
or 
power, 
by 
which 
we 
are 
capable 
of 
such 
knowledge, 
is 
that 
I 
here 
call 
power 
cognitive, 
orconceptive,thepower 
ofknowing 
orconceiving. 

Chapter 
2: 
The 
Cause 
of 
Sense 



1. 
HAVING 
DECLARED 
what 
I 
mean 
by 
the 
word 
conception, 
and 
other 
words 
equivalent 
thereunto, 
I 
come 
to 
the 
conceptions 
themselves, 
to 
show 
their 
difference, 
their 
causes, 
and 
the 
manner 
of 
their 
production 
as 
far 
as 
is 
necessaryforthis 
place. 
2. 
Originally 
all 
conceptions 
proceed 
from 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
thing 
itself, 
whereof 
it 
is 
the 
conception. 
Now 
when 
the 
action 
is 
present, 
the 
conception 
it 
produceth 
is 
called 
SENSE, 
and 
the 
thing 
by 
whose 
action 
the 
same 
is 
producediscalledtheOBJECTofsense. 
3. 
By 
our 
several 
organs 
we 
have 
several 
conceptions 
of 
several 
qualities 
in 
the 
objects; 
for 
by 
sight 
we 
have 
a 
conception 
or 
image 
composed 
of 
colour 
or 
figure, 
which 
is 
all 
the 
notice 
andknowledgethe 
object 
impartethto 
us 
of 
its 
nature 
by 
the 
eye. 
By 
hearing 
we 
have 
a 
conception 
called 
sound, 
which 
is 
all 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
object 
from 
the 
ear. 
And 
so 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
senses 
also 
are 
conceptions 
of 
several 
qualities, 
or 
naturesoftheir 
objects. 
4. 
Because 
the 
image 
in 
vision 
consisting 
in 
colour 
and 
shape 
is 
the 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
the 
qualities 
of 
the 
object 
of 
that 
sense; 
it 
is 
no 
hard 
matter 
for 
a 
man 
to 
fall 
into 
this 
opinion, 
that 
the 
same 
colour 
and 
shape 
are 
the 
very 
qualities 
themselves; 
and 
for 
the 
same 
cause, 
that 
sound 
and 
noise 
are 
the 
qualities 
of 
the 
bell, 
or 
of 
the 
air. 
And 
this 
opinion 
hath 
been 
so 
long 
received, 
that 
the 
contrary 
must 
needs 
appear 
a 
great 
paradox; 
and 
yet 
the 
introduction 
of 
species 
visible 
and 
intelligible 
(which 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
that 
opinion) 
passing 
to 
and 
fro 
from 
the 
object, 
is 
worse 
than 

any 
paradox, 
as 
being 
a 
plain 
impossibility. 
I 
shall 
therefore 
endeavour 
to 
makeplainthesefourpoints: 


(1) 
That 
the 
subject 
wherein 
colour 
and 
image 
are 
inherent, 
is 
not 
the 
object 
orthingseen. 
(2) 
That 
that 
is 
nothing 
without 
us 
really 
which 
we 
call 
an 
image 
or 
colour. 
(3) 
That 
the 
said 
image 
or 
colour 
is 
but 
an 
apparition 
unto 
us 
of 
that 
motion, 
agitation, 
or 
alteration, 
which 
the 
object 
worketh 
in 
the 
brain 
or 
spirits,orsomeinternalsubstanceofthehead. 
(4) 
That 
as 
in 
conception 
by 
vision, 
so 
also 
in 
the 
conceptions 
that 
arise 
from 
other 
senses, 
the 
subject 
of 
their 
inherence 
is 
not 
the 
object, 
but 
the 
sentient. 
5. 
Every 
man 
hath 
so 
much 
experience 
as 
to 
have 
seen 
the 
sun 
and 
other 
visible 
objects 
by 
reJection 
in 
the 
water 
and 
in 
glasses, 
and 
this 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
for 
this 
conclusion: 
that 
colour 
and 
image 
may 
be 
there 
where 
the 
thing 
seen 
is 
not. 
But 
because 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
notwithstanding 
the 
image 
in 
the 
water 
be 
not 
in 
the 
object, 
but 
a 
thing 
merely 
phantastical, 
yet 
there 
may 
be 
colour 
really 
in 
the 
thing 
itself; 
I 
will 
urge 
further 
this 
experience: 
that 
divers 
times 
men 
see 
directly 
the 
same 
object 
double, 
as 
two 
candles 
for 
one, 
which 
may 
happen 
by 
distemper, 
or 
otherwise 
without 
distemper 
if 
a 
man 
will, 
the
